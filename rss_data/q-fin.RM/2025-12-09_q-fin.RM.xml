      <title>Learning to Hedge Swaptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the deep hedging framework, based on reinforcement learning (RL), for the dynamic hedging of swaptions, contrasting its performance with traditional sensitivity-based rho-hedging. We design agents under three distinct objective functions (mean squared error, downside risk, and Conditional Value-at-Risk) to capture alternative risk preferences and evaluate how these objectives shape hedging styles. Relying on a three-factor arbitrage-free dynamic Nelson-Siegel model for our simulation experiments, our findings show that near-optimal hedging effectiveness is achieved when using two swaps as hedging instruments. Deep hedging strategies dynamically adapt the hedging portfolio's exposure to risk factors across states of the market. In our experiments, their out-performance over rho-hedging strategies persists even in the presence some of model misspecification. These results highlight RL's potential to deliver more efficient and resilient swaption hedging strategies.</description>

      <title>The Suicide Region: Option Games and the Race to Artificial General Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard real options theory predicts delay in exercising the option to invest or deploy when extreme asset volatility or technological uncertainty are present. However, in the current race to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), sovereign actors are exhibiting behaviors contrary to theoretical predictions: the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite acknowledging the potential for catastrophic failure from AGI misalignment. We resolve this puzzle by formalizing the AGI race as a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk. In our model, the cost of failure is no longer bounded only by the sunk cost of investment (I), but rather a systemic ruin parameter (D) that is correlated with development velocity and shared globally. As the disutility of catastrophe is embedded in both players' payoffs, the risk term mathematically cancels out of the equilibrium indifference condition. This creates a "suicide region" in the investment space where competitive pressures force rational agents to deploy AGI systems early, despite a negative risk-adjusted net present value. Furthermore, we show that "warning shots" (sub-existential disasters) will fail to deter AGI acceleration, as the winner-takes-all nature of the race remains intact. The race can only be halted if the cost of ruin is internalized, making safety research a prerequisite for economic viability. We derive the critical private liability threshold required to restore the option value of waiting and propose mechanism design interventions that can better ensure safe AGI research and socially responsible deployment.</description>

      <title>VaR at Its Extremes: Impossibilities and Conditions for One-Sided Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extremal aggregation behavior of Value-at-Risk (VaR) -- that is, its additivity properties across all probability levels -- for sums of one-sided random variables. For risks supported on \([0,\infty)\), we show that VaR sub-additivity is impossible except in the degenerate case of exact additivity, which holds only under co-monotonicity. To characterize when VaR is instead fully super-additive, we introduce two structural conditions: negative simplex dependence (NSD) for the joint distribution and simplex dominance (SD) for a margin-dependent functional. Together, these conditions provide a unified and easily verifiable framework that accommodates non-identical margins, heavy-tailed laws, and a wide spectrum of negative dependence structures. All results extend to random variables with arbitrary finite lower or upper endpoints, yielding sharp constraints on when strict sub- or super-additivity can occur.</description>

      <title>Sharpening Shapley Allocation: from Basel 2.5 to FRTB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk allocation, the decomposition of a portfolio-wide risk measure into component contributions, is a fundamental problem in financial risk management due to the non-additive nature of risk measures, the layered organizational structures of financial institutions, and the range of possible allocation strategies characterized by different rationales and properties.
  In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the major risk allocation strategies typically used in finance, comparing their theoretical properties, practical advantages, and limitations. To this scope we set up a specific testing framework, including both simplified settings, designed to highlight basic intrinsic behaviours, and realistic financial portfolios under different risk regulations, i.e. Basel 2.5 and FRTB. Furthermore, we develop and test novel practical solutions to manage the issue of negative risk allocations and of multi-level risk allocation in the layered organizational structure of financial institutions, while preserving the additivity property. Finally, we devote particular attention to the computational aspects of risk allocation.
  Our results show that, in this context, the Shapley allocation strategy offers the best compromise between simplicity, mathematical properties, risk representation and computational cost. The latter is still acceptable even in the challenging case of many business units, provided that an efficient Monte Carlo simulation is employed, which offers excellent scaling and convergence properties. While our empirical applications focus on market risk, our methodological framework is fully general and applicable to other financial context such as valuation risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, and counterparty credit risk.</description>

      <title>Autodeleveraging: Impossibilities and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism for perpetual futures venues. It is triggered when solvency-preserving liquidations fail. Despite the dominance of perpetual futures in the crypto derivatives market, with over \$60 trillion of volume in 2024, there has been no formal study of ADL. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous model of ADL. We prove that ADL mechanisms face a fundamental \emph{trilemma}: no policy can simultaneously satisfy exchange \emph{solvency}, \emph{revenue}, and \emph{fairness} to traders. This impossibility theorem implies that as participation scales, a novel form of \emph{moral hazard} grows asymptotically, rendering `zero-loss' socialization impossible. Constructively, we show that three classes of ADL mechanisms can optimally navigate this trilemma to provide fairness, robustness to price shocks, and maximal exchange revenue. We analyze these mechanisms on the Hyperliquid dataset from October 10, 2025, when ADL was used repeatedly to close \$2.1 billion of positions in 12 minutes. By comparing our ADL mechanisms to the standard approaches used in practice, we demonstrate empirically that Hyperliquid's production queue overutilized ADL by $\approx 28\times$ relative to our optimal policy, imposing roughly \$653 million of unnecessary haircuts on winning traders. This comparison also suggests that Binance overutilized ADL far more than Hyperliquid. Our results both theoretically and empirically demonstrate that optimized ADL mechanisms can dramatically reduce the loss of trader profits while maintaining exchange solvency.</description>
