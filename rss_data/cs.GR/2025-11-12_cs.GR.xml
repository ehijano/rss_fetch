      <title>Deep Inverse Shading: Consistent Albedo and Surface Detail Recovery via Generative Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing human avatars using generative priors is essential for achieving versatile and realistic avatar models. Traditional approaches often rely on volumetric representations guided by generative models, but these methods require extensive volumetric rendering queries, leading to slow training. Alternatively, surface-based representations offer faster optimization through differentiable rasterization, yet they are typically limited by vertex count, restricting mesh resolution and scalability when combined with generative priors. Moreover, integrating generative priors into physically based human avatar modeling remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce DIS (Deep Inverse Shading), a unified framework for high-fidelity, relightable avatar reconstruction that incorporates generative priors into a coherent surface representation. DIS centers on a mesh-based model that serves as the target for optimizing both surface and material details. The framework fuses multi-view 2D generative surface normal predictions, rich in detail but often inconsistent, into the central mesh using a normal conversion module. This module converts generative normal outputs into per-triangle surface offsets via differentiable rasterization, enabling the capture of fine geometric details beyond sparse vertex limitations. Additionally, DIS integrates a de-shading module to recover accurate material properties. This module refines albedo predictions by removing baked-in shading and back-propagates reconstruction errors to optimize the geometry. Through joint optimization of geometry and material appearance, DIS achieves physically consistent, high-quality reconstructions suitable for accurate relighting. Our experiments show that DIS delivers SOTA relighting quality, enhanced rendering efficiency, lower memory consumption, and detailed surface reconstruction.</description>

      <title>SONIC: Supersizing Motion Tracking for Natural Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.</description>

      <title>TouchWalker: Real-Time Avatar Locomotion from Touchscreen Finger Walking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TouchWalker, a real-time system for controlling full-body avatar locomotion using finger-walking gestures on a touchscreen. The system comprises two main components: TouchWalker-MotionNet, a neural motion generator that synthesizes full-body avatar motion on a per-frame basis from temporally sparse two-finger input, and TouchWalker-UI, a compact touch interface that interprets user touch input to avatar-relative foot positions. Unlike prior systems that rely on symbolic gesture triggers or predefined motion sequences, TouchWalker uses its neural component to generate continuous, context-aware full-body motion on a per-frame basis-including airborne phases such as running, even without input during mid-air steps-enabling more expressive and immediate interaction. To ensure accurate alignment between finger contacts and avatar motion, it employs a MoE-GRU architecture with a dedicated foot-alignment loss. We evaluate TouchWalker in a user study comparing it to a virtual joystick baseline with predefined motion across diverse locomotion tasks. Results show that TouchWalker improves users' sense of embodiment, enjoyment, and immersion.</description>

      <title>ElastoGen: 4D Generative Elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ElastoGen, a knowledge-driven AI model that generates physically accurate 4D elastodynamics. Unlike deep models that learn from video- or image-based observations, ElastoGen leverages the principles of physics and learns from established mathematical and optimization procedures. The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the differential equation, corresponding to the nonlinear force equilibrium, into a series of iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit deep architectures. We carefully build our network module following this overarching design philosophy. ElastoGen is much more lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale than deep generative models. Because of its alignment with actual physical procedures, ElastoGen efficiently generates accurate dynamics for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and can be easily integrated with upstream and downstream deep modules to enable end-to-end 4D generation.</description>
