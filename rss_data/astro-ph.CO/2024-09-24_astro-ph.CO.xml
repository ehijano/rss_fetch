      <title>Interpretation of SNIa and BAO cosmic probes results using a two-regions model of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SNIa and baryonic acoustic oscillations cosmic probes require performing measurements on astrophysical objects. Such objects are mostly located in overdense regions of the universe, where matter has grouped together. Measurements are thus biased in the sense that they collect information on a particular part of the universe only. Also, given the fact that the observations present a dynamics corresponding to an overall density evolving over time according to what we would expect for the density in overdense regions, we may wonder if the these cosmic probes measure the dynamics of such regions instead of the one of the global universe. In order to investigate this possibility, we improve here the two-regions model that was developed recently, to take into account the existence of overdense and underdense regions. Applying this model on SNIa and BAO cosmic probes, we highlight the reasons for which in practice we observe an accelerated expansion of the universe, involving an apparent cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic field at the cluster virial radius with volume-filling radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse synchrotron emission in the form of radio halos and radio relics probe the existence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. These nonthermal components are generated from the dissipation of kinetic energy released by turbulence and shocks injected in the intracluster medium (ICM) during the large-scale structure formation process. By using the deepest images ever obtained on a galaxy cluster at low-frequency (72 h LOFAR-HBA + 72 h LOFAR-LBA), in arXiv:2211.01493 we provided an unprecedented view of the distribution of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in the far outskirts of Abell 2255. In particular, we observed pervasive radio emission that fills the entire cluster volume and extends up to the cluster virial radius, reaching a maximum projected linear size of 5 Mpc. By combining radio and X-ray observations with advanced numerical simulations, we estimated the magnetic field and energy budget associated to turbulent motions at such large distances from the cluster center. Our results suggest an efficient transfer of kinetic energy into nonthermal components in the extremely diluted cluster outskirts. In the past two years, the total LOFAR-HBA observation time on Abell 2255 has increased to 336 hours. The analysis of this ultra-deep dataset aims to further advance our understanding of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in cluster peripheries.</description>

      <title>Double-well Inflation: observational constraints and theoretical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the small field double-well inflationary model and investigate its observational viability in light of the current Cosmic Microwave Background data. In particular, considering scenarios with minimal and nonminimal coupling between the inflaton field and the Ricci scalar, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis to probe the model's parameter space. We also investigate the consequences of the cosmological results in the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism context and obtain constraints on the vacuum expectation value of the inflaton field, together with the amplitude of the coupling to gravity in the nonminimal case. We employ a Bayesian procedure to compare the model's predictions with the Starobinsky inflationary scenario and find a strong statistical preference for the latter against the minimal and nonminimal coupled double-well scenario.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-3D visualization of Faraday structure in polarized radio sources: methods, science use cases, and development priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the construction of polarized intensity cubes $P$(RA, Dec, $\Phi$) and their visualization as movies, as a powerful technique for interpreting Faraday structure. $P$ is constructed from maps of peak polarized intensity P(RA, Dec) with their corresponding Faraday depth maps $\Phi$(RA, Dec). We illustrate the extensive scientific potential of such visualizations with a variety of science use cases from ASKAP and MeerKAT, presenting models that are consistent with the data but not necessarily unique. We demonstrate how one can, in principle, distinguish between cube structures which originate from unrelated foreground screens from those due to magnetized plasmas local to the emitting source. Other science use cases illustrate how variations in the local $n_e$ $B$, and line-of-sight distance to the synchrotron emitting regions can be distinguished using Faraday rotation. We show, for the first time, how the line-of-sight orientation of AGN jets can be determined. We also examine the case of M87 to show how internal jet magnetic field configurations can be identified, and extend earlier results. We recommend using this technique to re-evaluate all previous analyses of polarized sources that are well-resolved both spatially and in Faraday depth. Recognizing the subjective nature of interpretations at this early stage, we also highlight the need and utility for further scientific and technical developments.</description>

      <title>Impact of Large-Scale Structure Systematics on Cosmological Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large near-future galaxy surveys offer sufficient statistical power to make our cosmology analyses data-driven, limited primarily by systematic errors. Understanding the impact of systematics is therefore critical. We perform an end-to-end analysis to investigate the impact of some of the systematics that affect large-scale structure studies by doing an inference analysis using simulated density maps with various systematics; these include systematics caused by photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s), Galactic dust, structure induced by the telescope observing strategy and observing conditions, and incomplete covariance matrices. Specifically, we consider the impacts of incorrect photo-$z$ distributions (photometric biases, scatter, outliers; spectroscopic calibration biases), dust map resolution, incorrect dust law, selecting none or only some contaminant templates for deprojection, and using a diagonal covariance matrix instead of a full one. We quantify the biases induced by these systematics on cosmological parameter estimation using tomographic galaxy angular power spectra, with a focus on identifying whether the maximum plausible level of each systematic has an adverse impact on the estimation of key cosmological parameters from a galaxy clustering analysis with Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find photo-$z$ systematics to be the most pressing out of the systematics investigated, with spectroscopic calibration biases leading to the greatest adverse impact while helpfully being flagged by a high $\chi^2$ value for the best fit model. Larger-than-expected photo-$z$ scatter, on the other hand, has a significant impact without necessarily indicating a poor fit. In contrast, in the analysis framework used in this work, biases from observational systematics and incomplete covariance matrices are comfortably subdominant.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Tension in our own Backyard: DESI and the Nearness of the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration measured a tight relation between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the distance to the Coma cluster using the fundamental plane (FP) relation of the deepest, most homogeneous sample of early-type galaxies. To determine $H_0$, we measure the distance to Coma by several independent routes each with its own geometric reference. We measure the most precise distance to Coma from 12 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) in the cluster with mean standardized brightness of $m_B^0=15.712\pm0.041$ mag. Calibrating the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia with the HST distance ladder yields $D_{\textrm Coma}=98.5\pm2.2$ Mpc, consistent with its canonical value of 95--100 Mpc. This distance results in $H_0=76.5 \pm 2.2$ km/s/Mpc from the DESI FP relation. Inverting the DESI relation by calibrating it instead to the Planck+$\Lambda$CDM value of $H_0=67.4$ km/s/Mpc implies a much greater distance to Coma, $D_{\textrm Coma}=111.8\pm1.8$ Mpc, $4.6\sigma$ beyond a joint, direct measure. Independent of SNe Ia, the HST Key Project FP relation as calibrated by Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch from JWST, or HST NIR surface brightness fluctuations all yield $D_{\textrm Coma}&lt;$ 100 Mpc, in joint tension themselves with the Planck-calibrated route at $&gt;3\sigma$. From a broad array of distance estimates compiled back to 1990, it is hard to see how Coma could be located as far as the Planck+$\Lambda$CDM expectation of $&gt;$110 Mpc. By extending the Hubble diagram to Coma, a well-studied location in our own backyard whose distance was in good accord well before the Hubble Tension, DESI indicates a more pervasive conflict between our knowledge of local distances and cosmological expectations. We expect future programs to refine the distance to Coma and nearer clusters to help illuminate this new, local window on the Hubble Tension.</description>

      <title>PITSZI: Probing Intra-cluster medium Turbulence with Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Imaging -- Application to the triple merging cluster MACS J0717.5+3745</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent gas motions are expected to dominate the non-thermal energy budget of the intracluster medium (ICM). The measurement of pressure fluctuations from high angular resolution Sunyaev-Zel'dovich imaging opens a new avenue to study ICM turbulence, complementary to X-ray density fluctuation measures. We develop a methodological framework designed to optimally extract information on the ICM pressure fluctuation power spectrum statistics, and publicly release the associated software named PITSZI. We apply this tool to the NIKA data of the merging cluster MACSJ0717 to measure its pressure fluctuation power spectrum at high significance, and to investigate the implications for its nonthermal content. Depending on the choice of the radial pressure model and the details of the applied methodology, we measure an energy injection scale $L_{inj} \sim 800$ kpc. The power spectrum normalization corresponds to a characteristic amplitude reaching $A(k_{peak}) \sim 0.4$. These results are are obtained assuming that MACSJ0717 can be described as pressure fluctuations on top of a single (smooth) halo, and are dominated by systematics due to the choice of the radial pressure model. Using simulations, we estimate that fitting a radial model to the data can suppress the observed fluctuations by up to 50\%, while a poorly representative radial model can induce spurious fluctuations, which we also quantify. Assuming standard scaling relations between the pressure fluctuations and turbulence, we find that MACSJ0717 presents a turbulent velocity dispersion $\sigma_v \sim 1200$ km/s, a kinetic to kinetic plus thermal pressure fraction $P_{k} / P_{k+th} \sim 20\%$, and we estimate the hydrostatic mass bias to $b_{HSE} \sim 0.3-0.4$. Our results are in excellent agreement with alternative measurements from X-ray surface brightness fluctuations, and in agreement with the fluctuations being adiabatic in nature.</description>

      <title>Investigating Ultra-Large Large-Scale Structures: Potential Implications for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale structure (LSS) studies in cosmology map and analyse matter in the Universe on the largest scales. Understanding the LSS can provide observational support for the Cosmological Principle (CP) and the Standard Cosmological Model ($\Lambda$CDM). In recent years, many discoveries have been made of LSSs that are so large that they become difficult to understand within $\Lambda$CDM. Reasons for this are: they potentially challenge the CP, (i.e. the scale of homogeneity); and their formation and origin are not fully understood. In this article we review two recent LSS discoveries: the Giant Arc (GA, $\sim 1$ Gpc) and the Big Ring (BR, $\sim 400$ Mpc). Both structures are in the same cosmological neighbourhood -- at the same redshift $z \sim 0.8$ and with a separation on the sky of only $\sim 12^\circ$. Both structures exceed the often-cited scale of homogeneity (Yadav+ 2010), so individually and together, these two intriguing structures raise more questions for the validity of the CP and potentially hint at new physics beyond the Standard Model. The GA and BR were discovered using a novel method of mapping faint matter at intermediate redshifts, interpreted from the MgII absorption doublets seen in the spectra of background quasars.</description>

      <title>Search for a Gravitational-Wave Background from Sound Speed Resonance from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) originating from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) with the sound speed resonance (SSR) effect using data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's first three observing runs. The SSR mechanism, characterized by an oscillating sound speed squared term, can induce a nonperturbative parametric amplification of specific perturbation modes during inflation, leading to enhanced primordial curvature perturbations and a significant SIGW signal. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the model parameters describing the SGWB spectrum from the SSR effect. Our results show no statistically significant evidence for the presence of such a signal in the current data. Consequently, we place an upper limit of $|\tau_0| \lesssim 5.9 \times 10^3$ s at $95\%$ confidence level on the start time of the oscillation in the SSR model. These results demonstrate the capability of current gravitational wave detectors to probe inflation models through the SSR mechanism and paves the way for future searches with improved sensitivity.</description>

      <title>A swampland conjecture DESIder\'atum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key result of the string phenomenology framework is the two swampland conjectures (SCs), namely that the values of the scalar field excursion and gradient of the potential have to be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in Planck units. Using the first data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey and model-independent reconstructions of the SCs at late times, via a particular machine learning approach known as the genetic algorithms (GA), we find that the reconstructions of the SCs are, in fact, in agreement with their theoretical values of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Specifically, the reconstruction of the second SC is in fact several sigmas away from zero, thus indicating a very steep potential in contrast to recent model-specific analyses, assuming exponential potentials. Our approach is based solely on model-independent reconstructions of cosmological observables, such as the angular diameter distance and the Hubble expansion history, thus it is readily applicable to the forthcoming data from Stage IV surveys and will help settle in the near future the issue on the observational falsification, or not, of the two conjectures.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Estimators of Lagrangian Shape Biases: Universal Relations and Physical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is a key factor in modeling weak-lensing observations and can serve as a valuable signal for both cosmological and astrophysical studies. Modelling this signal requires understanding how galaxy shapes form, and their relations to the large-scale gravitational field -- typically encoded in the value of large-scale shape-bias parameters. In this article we contribute to this topic in three ways: (i) developing new estimators of Lagrangian shape-biases (ii) applying them to measure the shape-biases of dark-matter halos (iii) interpreting these measurements to gain insight on the process of halo-shape formation. We show that our estimators produce results consistent with previous literature, and that they possess advantages with respect to previous methods, namely that the measurement of each bias parameter is completely independent from the others, and that bias parameters can be defined for each individual object. We measure universal relations between shape-bias parameters and peak-significance, $\nu$. This relation for the first-order shape-bias parameter is linear at high $\nu$, and converges to zero at low $\nu$, which we interpret as strong evidence against the proposed scenario according to which galaxy shapes arise due to post-formation interaction with the large-scale tidal-field. We anticipate our estimators to be very useful in analyzing hydrodynamical simulations to extract physical understandings of galaxy shape formation, as well as establishing priors on the values of intrinsic-alignment biases.</description>

      <title>Probing $\Lambda$CDM through the Weyl potential and machine learning forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For years, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and cold dark matter (CDM) model ($\Lambda\text{CDM}$) has stood as a cornerstone in modern cosmology and serves as the predominant theoretical framework for current and forthcoming surveys. However, the latest results shown by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), along other cosmological data, show hints in favor of an evolving dark energy. Given the elusive nature of dark energy and the imperative to circumvent model bias, we introduce a novel null test, derived from Noether's theorem, that uses measurements of the Weyl potential (the sum of the spatial and temporal distortion) at different redshifts. In order to assess the consistency of the concordance model we quantify the precision of this null test through the reconstruction of mock catalogs based on $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ using forthcoming survey data, employing Genetic Algorithms, a machine learning technique. Our analysis indicates that with forthcoming LSST-like and DESI-like mock data our consistency test will be able to rule out several cosmological models at around 4$\sigma$ and help to check for tensions in the data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian forecasting with information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting techniques for assessing the power of future experiments to discriminate between theories or discover new laws of nature are of great interest in many areas of science. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian forecasting method using information theory. We argue that mutual information is a suitable quantity to study in this context. Besides being Bayesian, this proposal has the advantage of not relying on the choice of fiducial parameters, describing the "true" theory (which is a priori unknown), and is applicable to any probability distribution. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for parameter estimation and model selection, both of which are of interest concerning future experiments. We argue that mutual information has plausible interpretation in both situations. In addition, we state a number of propositions that offer information-theoretic meaning to some of the Bayesian practices such as performing multiple experiments, combining different datasets, and marginalization.</description>

      <title>Evaporating Axion Dark Matter and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles are a well-motivated dark matter candidate that can form a condensate with low momentum and high occupation number. In the presence of dark radiation, this condensate loses energy, naturally increasing the energy density of the universe around matter-radiation equality without requiring additional inputs. This general mechanism may offer a solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Light in the Shadows: Primordial Black Holes Making Dark Matter Shine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility of indirect detection of dark sector processes by investigating a novel form of interaction between ambient dark matter (DM) and primordial black holes (PBHs). The basic scenario we envisage is that the ambient DM is ``dormant'', \ie, it has interactions with the SM, but its potential for an associated SM signal is not realized for various reasons. We argue that the presence of PBHs with active Hawking radiation (independent of any DM considerations) can act as a catalyst in this regard by overcoming the aforementioned bottlenecks. The central point is that PBHs radiate all types of particles, whether in the standard model (SM) or beyond (BSM), which have a mass at or below their Hawking temperature. The emission of such radiation is ``democratic" (up to the particle spin), since it is based on a coupling of sorts of gravitational origin. In particular, such shining of (possibly dark sector) particles onto ambient DM can then activate the latter into giving potentially observable SM signals. We illustrate this general mechanism with two specific models. First, we consider asymmetric DM, which is characterized by an absence of ambient anti-DM, and consequently the absence of DM indirect detection signals. In this case, PBHs can ``resurrect'' such a signal by radiating anti-DM, which then annihilates with ambient DM in order to give SM particles such as photons. In our second example, we consider the PBH emission of dark gauge bosons which can excite ambient DM into a heavier state (which is, again, not ambient otherwise), this heavier state later decays back into DM and photons. Finally, we demonstrate that we can obtain observable signals of these BSM models from asteroid-mass PBHs (Hawking radiating currently with $\sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{MeV})$ temperatures) at gamma-ray experiments such as AMEGO-X.</description>

      <title>Plausible constraints and inflationary production for dark photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic constraints on dark photons are generally presented assuming they have Stueckelberg masses. These constraints are strengthened if instead the mass is due to the Higgs mechanism and the dark Higgs is light. First, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the origin of kinetic mixing $\epsilon$ and perturbativity, the strengthened constraints on $\epsilon$ cannot be arbitrarily relaxed by making the Higgs heavy. Second, we demonstrate a simple mechanism for generating dark photon dark matter after inflation, where fluctuations of a dark Higgs by stochastic misalignment can produce stable dark photons through $h\to A'A'$ decay. Third, we point out new lower bounds on $\epsilon$ in the case where the dark photon mediates thermal freeze-out of light dark matter by $s$-channel exchange, taking account of generic expectations for the size of $\epsilon$, and astrophysical upper bounds on the self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmological first-order phase transitions with precise hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational wave spectrum generated by sound waves during a cosmological phase transition, incorporating several advancements beyond the current state-of-the-art. Rather than relying on the bag model or similar approximations, we derive the equation of state directly from the effective potential. This approach enables us to accurately determine the hydrodynamic quantities, which serve as initial conditions in a generalised hybrid simulation. This simulation tracks the fluid evolution after bubble collisions, leading to the generation of gravitational waves. Our work is the first self-consistent numerical calculation of gravitational waves for the real singlet extension of the standard model. Our computational method is adaptable to any particle physics model, offering a fast and reliable way to calculate gravitational waves generated by sound waves. With fewer approximations, our approach provides a robust foundation for precise gravitational wave calculations and allows for the exploration of model-independent features of gravitational waves from phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Using dust to constrain dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-type haloes to explore using dust as an observational tracer to discriminate between cold and warm dark matter universes. Comparing a cold and 3.5keV warm dark matter particle model, we tune the efficiency of galaxy formation in our simulations using a variable supernova rate to create Milky Way systems with similar satellite galaxy populations while keeping all other simulation parameters the same. Cold dark matter, having more substructure, requires a higher supernova efficiency than warm dark matter to achieve the same satellite galaxy number. These different supernova efficiencies create different dust distributions around their host galaxies, which we generate by post-processing the simulation output with the POWDERDAY codebase. Analysing the resulting dust in each simulation, we find $\sim$4.5 times more dust in our cold dark matter Milky Way halos compared with warm dark matter. The distribution of dust out to R$_{200\text{c}}$ is then explored, revealing that the warm dark matter simulations are noticeably less concentrated than their cold dark matter counterparts, although differences in substructure complicate the comparison. Our results indicate that dust is a possible unique probe to test theories of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The impact of non-perturbative effects in dark matter production and detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter stands out as one of the most important unsolved mysteries in particle physics and cosmology. We investigate the influence of non-perturbative effects on the production of dark matter as well as their impact on direct and indirect detection to attain insight on its fundamental nature. Specifically, we focus on Sommerfeld enhancement and the formation of dark matter bound states both of which can alter the total dark matter annihilation cross section and thus modify dark matter observables in the early and late Universe. To this end, we conducted two studies focusing on different dark matter observables, which are likely to be probed by upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on resonant DM annihilations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of BBN constraints from photodisintegration for scenarios in which dark-matter annihilations are resonantly-enhanced. To this end, we implement and make available a new class ResonanceModel within an updated version v1.3.0 of ACROPOLIS. While the corresponding implementation is done in a rather model-independent way, we also make available three benchmark models that can be used to calculate constraints for more concrete scenarios. Using this new version of ACROPOLIS, we present for the first time the corresponding constraints on resonantly-enhanced $s$-wave and $p$-wave annihilations. We show that for $s$-wave annihilations the bounds are usually very similar to the ones without a resonance, while for $p$-wave annihilations the bounds can be significantly stronger.
  The updated version v1.3.0 of ACROPOLIS can be found at https://github.com/hep-mh/acropolis .</description>

      <title>SMILE: Discriminating milli-lens systems in a pilot project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos, or free-floating supermassive black holes (SMBHs), that might be comprised of primordial black holes (PBHs), in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9 M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz, and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. Using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and their mimickers. Using the above constraints, we rule out 32 out of our initial 40 candidates as milli-lenses, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we find many new candidates for compact symmetric objects, that are thought to be short-lived, jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the SMILE (Search for MIlli-LEnses) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating dark sirens and galaxies: constraints on $H_0$ from GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the cross-correlation technique to infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) of the Universe using gravitational wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts (dark sirens) from the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and the photometric galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISE-SuperCOSMOS, and combine these with the bright siren measurement of $H_0$ from GW170817. The posterior on $H_0$ with only dark sirens is uninformative due to the small number of well-localised GW sources. Using the eight well-localized dark sirens and the binary neutron star GW170817 with EM counterpart, we obtain a value of the Hubble constant $H_0= 75.4_{-6}^{+11}$ km/s/Mpc (median and 68.3$\%$ equal-tailed interval (ETI)) after marginalizing over the matter density and the GW bias parameters. This measurement is mostly driven by the bright siren measurement and any constraint from dark sirens is not statistically significant. In the future, with more well-localized GW events, the constraints on expansion history will improve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a test of MOND and Verlinde's Emergent Gravity using the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723-7327, which has been recently imaged using the eROSITA X-ray telescope as well as with JWST. We test MOND using two independent methods. The first method involves comparing the dynamical MOND mass and baryonic mass, while the second method entails a comparison of the MOND-estimated temperature with the observed temperature. We then compare the unseen mass predicted by Emergent Gravity with the estimated dark matter mass. We find that MOND shows a mass discrepancy in the central regions at high significance levels. The observed temperature profile is in marginal disagreement with that in the MOND paradigm. However, the Emergent Gravity Theory agrees in accurately accounting for the dynamical mass in the inner regions within $1\sigma$. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the earlier tests on other clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for subsolar mass primordial black holes (PBHs) poses a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, extended signal duration, and computational cost demands, compared to solar mass binary black hole events. In this paper, we explore the possibility of investigating the mass range between subsolar and planetary masses, which is not accessible using standard matched filtering and continuous wave searches. We propose a systematic approach employing the Viterbi algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm that identifies the most likely sequence of hidden Markov states given a sequence of observations, to detect signals from small mass PBH binaries. We formulate the methodology, provide the optimal length for short-time Fourier transforms, and estimate sensitivity. Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Viterbi algorithm in identifying signals within mock data containing Gaussian noise. Our approach offers the primary advantage of being agnostic and computationally efficient.</description>

Abstract: The power spectrum, as a statistic in Fourier space, is commonly numerically calculated using the fast Fourier transform method to efficiently reduce the computational costs. To alleviate the systematic bias known as aliasing due to the insufficient sampling, the interlacing technique was proposed. We derive the analytical form of the shot noise under the interlacing technique, which enables the exact separation of the Poisson shot noise from the signal in this case. Thanks to the accurate shot noise subtraction, we demonstrate an enhancement in the accuracy of power spectrum estimation, and compare with the other widely used estimators in community. The good performance of our estimation allows an abatement in the computational cost by using low resolution and low order mass assignment scheme in the analysis for huge surveys and mocks.</description>

      <title>Small Magellanic Cloud Cepheids Observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Provide a New Anchor for the SH0ES Distance Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present phase-corrected photometric measurements of 88 Cepheid variables in the core of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the first sample obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3, in the same homogeneous photometric system as past measurements of all Cepheids on the SH0ES distance ladder. We limit the sample to the inner core and model the geometry to reduce errors in prior studies due to the nontrivial depth of this cloud. Without crowding present in ground-based studies, we obtain an unprecedentedly low dispersion of 0.102 mag for a period-luminosity (P-L) relation in the SMC, approaching the width of the Cepheid instability strip. The new geometric distance to 15 late-type detached eclipsing binaries in the SMC offers a rare opportunity to improve the foundation of the distance ladder, increasing the number of calibrating galaxies from three to four. With the SMC as the only anchor, we find H$_0\!=\!74.1 \pm 2.1$ km/s/Mpc. Combining these four geometric distances with our HST photometry of SMC Cepheids, we obtain H$_0\!=\!73.17 \pm 0.86$ km/s/Mpc. By including the SMC in the distance ladder, we also double the range where the metallicity ([Fe/H]) dependence of the Cepheid P-L relation can be calibrated, and we find $\gamma = -0.234 \pm 0.052$ mag/dex. Our local measurement of H$_0$ based on Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae shows a 5.8$\sigma$ tension with the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming a Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, reinforcing the possibility of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

In this paper, we point out that the GW signal from cosmic strings produced at a comparatively low energy scale, $v \lesssim 10^9 \textrm{GeV}$, exhibits several novel features that are not present in the case of high-scale cosmic strings. Our findings notably include (i) a sharp cutoff frequency $f_{\rm cut}$ in the GW spectrum from the fundamental oscillation mode on closed string loops and (ii) an oscillating pattern in the total GW spectrum from all oscillation modes whose local minima are located at integer multiples of $f_{\rm cut}$. These features reflect the fact that string loops produced in the early Universe fail to shrink to zero size because of GW emission within the age of the Universe, if their tension is low enough. In addition, they offer an exciting opportunity to directly probe the discrete spectrum of oscillation modes on closed string loops in GW observations. For strings produced at a scale $v \sim 10^9\textrm{GeV}$, the novel features in the GW spectrum are within the sensitivity reach of future experiments such as BBO and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>The impact of a primordial gravitational wave background on LISA resolvable sources</title>

Abstract: The existence of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a common prediction in various models of the early Universe. Despite constraints at different frequency ranges and claims of detection in the nHz range by Pulsar Timing Arrays, the amplitude and spectral dependence of the SGWB in the mHz range remain largely unknown. Plausible models of early Universe Physics predict a wide range of SGWB amplitudes, from undetectable to exceeding the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. This paper explores the potential impact of a prominent primordial SGWB on LISA's main scientific targets. Our main analyses focuses on Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs). By employing publicly available MBHB population models and state-of-the-art LISA's forecasting pipeline, we analyze the effects of the SGWB on MBHB detections. We find that the decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio induced by a strong primordial GWB can significantly reduce the number of detectable events, compromise the precision of constraints, and even hinder sky localization for some events. We also examine the impact of the SGWB on Stellar Origin Black Hole Binaries (SOBHBs) and Galactic Binaries (GBs), which are fainter sources than MBHBs. Depending on the spectral properties of the SGWB, we conclude that these sources could be either marginally affected or rendered completely undetectable. This largely unexplored aspect raises critical questions about the potential challenges posed by a prominent SGWB to LISA's astrophysical objectives, including MBHBs, SOBHBs, and GBs.</description>

      <title>Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and sign-switching cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Annihilation to gamma-rays from SPT-SZ selected Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for dark matter annihilation from galaxy clusters in the energy range from 1-300 GeV using nearly 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. For this purpose, we use 350 galaxy clusters selected from the 2500 $\rm{deg^2}$ SPT-SZ survey. We model the dark matter distribution using the NFW profile for the main halo along with the Einasto profile for the substructure. The largest signal is seen for the cluster SPT-CL J2021-5257 with a significance of around $3\sigma$. The best-fit dark matter mass and annihilation cross-section for this cluster are equal to $(60.0 \pm 11.8)$ GeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle= (6.0 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-25} \rm{cm^3 s^{-1}}$ for the $\bar{b} b$ annihilation channel. However, this central estimate is in conflict with the limits on annihilation cross-section from dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and hence cannot be attributed to dark matter annihilation. Three other clusters show significance between $2-2.5\sigma$, whereas all the remaining clusters show null results. The most stringent 95\% c.l. upper limit for the WIMP annihilation cross-section among all the clusters is from SPT-CL J0455-4159, viz. $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 6.44 \times 10^{-26} \text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}$ for $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel.</description>

      <title>How new physics affects primordial neutrinos decoupling: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological observations from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer crucial insights into the Early Universe, enabling us to trace its evolution back to lifetimes as short as 0.01 seconds. Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements, such as those underway at the Simons Observatory, will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the properties of the primordial plasma and, in particular, primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether these properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving this equation that offers model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency - features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma's evolution in the presence of new physics.</description>

      <title>Coleman-Weinberg dynamics of ultralight scalar dark matter and GeV-scale right-handed neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model by three singlet fermions and one singlet real scalar field. The scalar is an ultralight dark matter candidate whose abundance is set by dynamically induced misalignment from the Higgs portal. We focus on parameter space where the Coleman-Weinberg potential both fixes the dark matter relic abundance, and predicts the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos. The model prefers scalar masses in the range of $10 ~{\rm {\mu}eV} \lesssim m_{\phi} \lesssim 10 ~{\rm meV}$, and can be tested via direct searches for a light scalar (e.g. fifth force tests), or by searching for right-handed neutrinos in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Do assumptions about the central density of subhaloes affect dark matter annihilation and lensing calculations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing body of evidence suggests that the central density of cuspy dark matter subhaloes is conserved in minor mergers. However, empirical models of subhalo evolution, calibrated from simulations, often assume a drop in the central density. Since empirical models of subhaloes are used in galaxy-galaxy lensing studies and dark matter annihilation calculations, we explore the consequences of assuming different subhalo models. We find that dark matter annihilation calculations are very sensitive to the assumed subhalo mass profile, and different models can give more than a magnitude difference in the J-factor and boost factor in individual haloes. On the other hand, the shear and convergence profiles used in galaxy-galaxy lensing are sensitive to the initial profile assumed (e.g., NFW versus Einato) but are otherwise well-approximated by a simple model in which the original profile is sharply truncated. We conclude that since the innermost parts of haloes are difficult to resolve in simulations, it is important to have a theoretical understanding of how subhaloes evolve to make accurate predictions of the dark matter annihilation signal.</description>

      <title>Hot gas accretion fuels star formation faster than cold accretion in high redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use high-resolution ($\simeq$ 35pc) hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation to investigate the relation between gas accretion and star formation in galaxies hosted by dark matter haloes of mass $10^{12}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z = 2$. At high redshift, cold-accreted gas is expected to be readily available for star formation, while gas accreted in a hot mode is expected to require a longer time to cool down before being able to form stars. Contrary to these expectations, we find that the majority of cold-accreted gas takes several hundred Myr longer to form stars than hot-accreted gas after it reaches the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM). Approximately 10% of the cold-accreted gas flows rapidly through the inner CGM onto the galactic disc. The remaining 90% is trapped in a turbulent accretion region that extends up to $\sim$ 50 per cent of the virial radius, from which it takes several hundred Myr for the gas to be transported to the star-forming disc. In contrast, most hot shock-heated gas avoids this 'slow track', and accretes directly from the CGM onto the disc where stars can form. We find that shock-heating of cold gas after accretion in the inner CGM and supernova-driven outflows contribute to, but do not fully explain, the delay in star formation. These processes combined slow down the delivery of cold-accreted gas to the galactic disc and consequently limit the rate of star formation in Milky Way mass galaxies at $z &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the subsolar-mass black hole candidate SSM200308 from the second part of the third observing run of Advanced LIGO-Virgo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A follow-up of a subsolar black hole candidate identified in the second part of the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration is carried out. With a search signal-to-noise ratio of $8.90$ and a false-alarm rate of 1 per 5 years, close to the usual thresholds for claiming a gravitational-wave event, we cannot exclude a noise origin. A complete Bayesian parameter estimation of this candidate, denoted SSM200308, reveals that if the signal originates from a compact binary coalescence, the component masses are $m_1= 0.62^{+0.46}_{-0.20} M_{\odot}$ and $m_2 = 0.27^{+0.12}_{-0.10} M_{\odot}$ (90% credible intervals) with at least one component being firmly subsolar, below the minimum mass of a neutron star. This discards the hypothesis that the signal comes from a standard binary neutron star. The signal coherence test between the two LIGO detectors brings support to a compact object coalescence origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extragalactic and galactic cosmic rays scatter with the cosmic neutrino background during propagation to Earth, yielding a flux of relic neutrinos boosted to larger energies. If an overdensity of relic neutrinos is present in galaxies, and neutrinos are massive enough, this flux might be detectable by high-energy neutrino experiments. For a lightest neutrino of mass $m_{\nu} \sim 0.1$ eV, we find an upper limit on the local relic neutrino overdensity of $\sim 10^{13}$ and an upper limit on the relic neutrino overdensity at TXS 0506+056 of $\sim 10^{10}$. Future experiments like GRAND or IceCube-Gen2 could improve these bounds by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the time evolution of matter-gravity coupling can provide a natural explanation to the apparent Hubble tension, since it induces a modification of the Friedman equation with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the low redshift variation of the coupling can can affect the distance of the anchors used to calibrate supernovae (SNe), while higher redshift observations are not affected. The effects of a time varying gravity coupling only manifest on sufficiently long time scales, such as in cosmological observations at different redshifts, and if ignored lead to apparent tensions in the values of cosmological parameters estimated with observations from different epochs of the Universe history.</description>

      <title>General geometry realized by four-scalar model and application to $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a model including four scalar fields coupled with general gravity theories, which is a generalization of the two-scalar model proposed in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{103} (2021) no.4, 044055, where it has been shown that any given spherically symmetric static/time-dependent spacetime can be realized by using the two-scalar model. We show that by using the four-scalar model, we can construct a model that realizes any given spacetime as a solution even if the spacetime does not have a spherical symmetry or any other symmetry. We also show that by imposing constraints on the scalar fields by using the Lagrange multiplier fields, the scalar fields become non-dynamical and they do not propagate. This tells that there does not appear any sound which is usually generated by the density fluctuation of the fluid. In this sense, the model with the constraints is a most general extension of the mimetic theory in JHEP \textbf{11} (2013), 135, where there appears an effective dark matter. The dark matter is non-dynamical and it does not collapse even under gravitational force. Our model can be regarded as a general extension of any kind of fluid besides dark matter. We may consider the case that the potential of the scalar fields vanishes and the model becomes a non-linear $\sigma$ model. Then our formulation gives a mapping from the geometry of the spacetime to the geometry of the target space of the non-linear $\sigma$ model via gravity theory although the physical meaning has not been clear. We also consider the application of the model to $f(Q)$ gravity theory, which is based on a non-metricity tensor and $Q$ is a scalar quantity constructed from the non-metricity tensor. ...</description>

      <title>The MUSE eXtremely Deep Field: Detections of circumgalactic SiII* emission at z&gt;~2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) serves as a baryon reservoir that connects galaxies to the intergalactic medium and fuels star formation. The spatial distribution of the metal-enriched cool CGM has not yet been directly revealed at cosmic noon (z~2-4), as bright emission lines at these redshifts are not covered by optical integral field units. To remedy this situation, we aim for the first-ever detections and exploration of extended SiII* emission (low-ionization state, LIS), referred to as ``SiII* halos'', at redshifts ranging from z=2 to 4 as a means to trace the metal-enriched cool CGM. We use a sample of 39 galaxies with systemic redshifts of z=2.1-3.9 measured with the [CIII] doublet in the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field catalog, which contains integration times spanning from ~30 to 140 hours. We search for extended SiII*1265, 1309, 1533 emission (fluorescent lines) around individual galaxies. We also stack a subsample of 14 UV-bright galaxies. We report five individual detections of SiII*1533 halos. We also confirm the presence of SiII*1533 halos in stacks for the subsample containing UV-bright sources. The other lines do not show secure detections of extended emission in either individual or stacking analyses. These detections may imply that the presence of metal-enriched CGM is a common characteristic for UV-bright galaxies. To investigate whether the origin of SiII* is continuum pumping as suggested in previous studies, we check the consistency of the equivalent width (EW) of SiII* emission and the EW of SiII absorption for the individual halo object with the most reliable detection. We confirm the equivalence, suggesting that photon conservation works for this object and pointing toward continuum pumping as the source of SiII*. We also investigate SiII* lines in a RAMSES-RT zoom-in simulation including continuum pumping and find ubiquitous presence of extended halos.</description>

Abstract: The simplest model of inflation is based around an inflaton field that starts in a coherent false vacuum state with a positive cosmological constant, rolls slowly to the true vacuum and relaxes to it via reheating. We examine whether the scale of the transition from coherence to chaoticity can be examined via the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, in parallel with analogous problems of heavy ion physics (the ``pion laser'' and the thermalizing glasma).
  We develop an ansatz which contains a definition of ''chaoticity'' which parallels that of the usual setups where HBT is used.
  However, we also discuss the differences between the inflationary setup and more mainstream uses of HBT and conclude that these are more significant than the similarities, making the use of the developed methodology uncertain.</description>

      <title>Dark matter-electron scattering and freeze-in scenarios in the light of $Z^\prime$ mediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM)-electron scattering in a minimal $U(1)_X$ extension of the Standard Model (SM), where the DM can appear as a Majorana fermion, a complex singlet scalar or a Dirac fermion. To study bounds on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and new gauge boson mass $(M_{Z^\prime})$, from DM-electron scattering, we consider several direct search experiments like CDMS, DAMIC, SENSEI, PandaX-II, DarkSide-50 and XENON1T-S2 for different $U(1)_X$ charges. In this set-up we consider DM production via freeze-in both in radiation dominated and modified cosmological background to project sensitivities on $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane satisfying observed relic abundance. DM-electron scattering could provide comparable, or even stronger bounds than those obtained from the electron/ muon $(g-2)$, low energy scattering and intensity frontier experiments within 0.01 GeV $\lesssim M_{Z^\prime} \lesssim$ 0.1 GeV. Constrains from freeze-in could provide stronger sensitivities for $M_{Z^\prime}\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV, however, these limits are comparable to those obtained from LHCb, LEP experiments for $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV $\lesssim M_{Z^\prime} \lesssim 150$ GeV. In future, electron-muon scattering (MUonE), proton (FASER, DUNE) and electron/positron (ILC) beam dump experiments could probe these parameters.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos bend? Consequences of an ultralight gauge field as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultralight gauge boson could address the missing cosmic dark matter, with its transverse modes contributing to a relevant component of the galactic halo today. We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and neutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the galactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae could be delayed by $\delta t = \left(10^{-8}-10^1\right)\,$s for the gauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \left(10^{-23}-10^{-19}\right)\,$eV and the coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}-10^{-20}$. While we do not focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark matter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We discuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force experiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos. We consider the concrete case of the DUNE facility, where the coupling can be tested down to $g \simeq 10^{-27}$ for neutrinos coming from a supernova event at a distance $d = 10\,$kpc from Earth.</description>

      <title>Improving Mimetic Gravity with Non-trivial Scalar Potential: Cosmology, Black Holes, Shadow and Photon Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is not easy to treat the spacetime with horizon(s) in the standard mimetic gravity. The solution to this problem has been presented in Phys.~Lett.~B 830 (2022), 137140, where it was suggested to modify the Lagrange multiplier constraint.
  In this paper, by using the improved formulation, we investigate the cosmology and black holes in mimetic gravity with scalar potential and in the scalar mimetic $F(R)$ gravity. The inflationary era and dark energy epoch for the above theories are presented as specific examples from the general reconstruction scheme which permits to realise any universe expansion history via the choice of the corresponding scalar potential or function $F(R)$. Two black hole solutions including the Schwarzschild and Hayward ones are constructed. The shadow and the radius of the photon sphere for the above black holes are found. The explicit confrontation of the black hole shadow radius with the observational bounds from M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ objects is done. It is demonstrated that they do not conflict with Event Horizon Telescope observations.</description>
