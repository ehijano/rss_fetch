      <title>Advancing Tabular Stroke Modelling Through a Novel Hybrid Architecture and Feature-Selection Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain stroke remains one of the principal causes of death and disability worldwide, yet most tabular-data prediction models still hover below the 95% accuracy threshold, limiting real-world utility. Addressing this gap, the present work develops and validates a completely data-driven and interpretable machine-learning framework designed to predict strokes using ten routinely gathered demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables sourced from a public cohort of 4,981 records. We employ a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and distribution, followed by rigorous data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier removal, and class imbalance correction using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). To streamline feature selection, point-biserial correlation and random-forest Gini importance were utilized, and ten varied algorithms-encompassing tree ensembles, boosting, kernel methods, and a multilayer neural network-were optimized using stratified five-fold cross-validation. Their predictions based on probabilities helped us build the proposed model, which included Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a support-vector classifier, with logistic regression acting as a meta-learner. The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.2% and an F1-score of 97.15%, indicating a significant enhancement compared to the leading individual model, LightGBM, which had an accuracy of 91.4%. Our study's findings indicate that rigorous preprocessing, coupled with a diverse hybrid model, can convert low-cost tabular data into a nearly clinical-grade stroke-risk assessment tool.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Mortality in Geriatric Traumatic Brain Injury Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major contributor to mortality among older adults, with geriatric patients facing disproportionately high risk due to age-related physiological vulnerability and comorbidities. Early and accurate prediction of mortality is essential for guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing ICU resource allocation. In this study, we utilized the MIMIC-III database to identify geriatric TBI patients and applied a machine learning framework to develop a 30-day mortality prediction model. A rigorous preprocessing pipeline-including Random Forest-based imputation, feature engineering, and hybrid selection-was implemented to refine predictors from 69 to 9 clinically meaningful variables. CatBoost emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an AUROC of 0.867 (95% CI: 0.809-0.922), surpassing traditional scoring systems. SHAP analysis confirmed the importance of GCS score, oxygen saturation, and prothrombin time as dominant predictors. These findings highlight the value of interpretable machine learning tools for early mortality risk stratification in elderly TBI patients and provide a foundation for future clinical integration to support high-stakes decision-making in critical care.</description>

      <title>An Inclusive Foundation Model for Generalizable Cytogenetics in Precision Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromosome analysis is vital for diagnosing genetic disorders and guiding cancer therapy decisions through the identification of somatic clonal aberrations. However, developing an AI model are hindered by the overwhelming complexity and diversity of chromosomal abnormalities, requiring extensive annotation efforts, while automated methods remain task-specific and lack generalizability due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets spanning diverse resource conditions. Here, we introduce CHROMA, a foundation model for cytogenomics, designed to overcome these challenges by learning generalizable representations of chromosomal abnormalities. Pre-trained on over 84,000 specimens (~4 million chromosomal images) via self-supervised learning, CHROMA outperforms other methods across all types of abnormalities, even when trained on fewer labelled data and more imbalanced datasets. By facilitating comprehensive mapping of instability and clonal leisons across various aberration types, CHROMA offers a scalable and generalizable solution for reliable and automated clinical analysis, reducing the annotation workload for experts and advancing precision oncology through the early detection of rare genomic abnormalities, enabling broad clinical AI applications and making advanced genomic analysis more accessible.</description>

      <title>Learning collective multi-cellular dynamics from temporal scRNA-seq via a transformer-enhanced Neural SDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets offer unprecedented insights into the dynamics and heterogeneity of cellular systems. These systems exhibit multiscale collective behaviors driven by intricate intracellular gene regulatory networks and intercellular interactions of molecules. However, inferring interacting cell population dynamics from time-series scRNA-seq data remains a significant challenge, as cells are isolated and destroyed during sequencing. To address this, we introduce scIMF, a single-cell deep generative Interacting Mean Field model, designed to learn collective multi-cellular dynamics. Our approach leverages a transformer-enhanced stochastic differential equation network to simultaneously capture cell-intrinsic dynamics and intercellular interactions. Through extensive benchmarking on multiple scRNA-seq datasets, scIMF outperforms existing methods in reconstructing gene expression at held-out time points, demonstrating that modeling cell-cell communication enhances the accuracy of multicellular dynamics characterization.Additionally, our model provides biologically interpretable insights into cell-cell interactions during dynamic processes, offering a powerful tool for understanding complex cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of ECG QRS Complexes to His-Purkinje Structure in Computational Heart Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac digital twins (CDT) are emerging as a potentially transformative tool in cardiology. A critical yet understudied determinant of CDT accuracy is the His-Purkinje system (HPS), which influences ventricular depolarization and shapes the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Here, we quantify how structural variations in the HPS alter QRS morphology and identify which parameters drive this variability. We generated HPS structures using a fractal-tree, rule-based algorithm, systematically varying nine model parameters and assessing their effects on ten QRS-related metrics. We conducted a Sobol sensitivity analysis to quantify direct and interaction-driven contributions of each parameter to observed variability. Our results suggest that most minor changes in HPS structure exert minimal influence on individual QRS features; however, certain parameter combinations can produce abnormal QRS morphologies. Wave durations and peak amplitudes of the QRS complex exhibit low sensitivity to individual HPS parameter variations; however, we found that specific parameter combinations can result in interactions that significantly alter these aspects of QRS morphology. We found that certain HPS structures can cause premature QRS formation, obscuring P-wave formation. QRS timing variability was primarily driven by interactions among branch and fascicle angles and branch repulsivity, though other parameters also showed notable interaction effects. In addition to interactions, individual variations in the number of branches in the HPS also affected QRS timing. While future models should account for these potential sources of variability, this study indicates that minor anatomical differences between a healthy patient's HPS and that of a generic model are unlikely to significantly impact model fidelity or clinical interpretation when both systems are physiologically normal.</description>

      <title>A collaborative constrained graph diffusion model for the generation of realistic synthetic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing new molecular compounds is crucial to address pressing challenges, from health to environmental sustainability. However, exploring the molecular space to discover new molecules is difficult due to the vastness of the space. Here we introduce CoCoGraph, a collaborative and constrained graph diffusion model capable of generating molecules that are guaranteed to be chemically valid. Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters. Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.</description>

      <title>Learning Genomic Structure from $k$-mers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequencing a genome to determine an individual's DNA produces an enormous number of short nucleotide subsequences known as reads, which must be reassembled to reconstruct the full genome. We present a method for analyzing this type of data using contrastive learning, in which an encoder model is trained to produce embeddings that cluster together sequences from the same genomic region. The sequential nature of genomic regions is preserved in the form of trajectories through this embedding space. Trained solely to reflect the structure of the genome, the resulting model provides a general representation of $k$-mer sequences, suitable for a range of downstream tasks involving read data. We apply our framework to learn the structure of the $E.\ coli$ genome, and demonstrate its use in simulated ancient DNA (aDNA) read mapping and identification of structural variations. Furthermore, we illustrate the potential of using this type of model for metagenomic species identification. We show how incorporating a domain-specific noise model can enhance embedding robustness, and how a supervised contrastive learning setting can be adopted when a linear reference genome is available, by introducing a distance thresholding parameter $\Gamma$. The model can also be trained fully self-supervised on read data, enabling analysis without the need to construct a full genome assembly using specialized algorithms. Small prediction heads based on a pre-trained embedding are shown to perform on par with BWA-aln, the current gold standard approach for aDNA mapping, in terms of accuracy and runtime for short genomes. Given the method's favorable scaling properties with respect to total genome size, inference using our approach is highly promising for metagenomic applications and for mapping to genomes comparable in size to the human genome.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring diagnostic performance of AI models before clinical use is key to the safe and successful adoption of these technologies. Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing. Overall, AI offers good accuracy when applied to WSIs but requires more rigorous evaluation of its performance.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Multi-Stage Algorithm and Bounds for Group Testing with Prior Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10018v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-stage algorithm for non-adaptive Group Testing (GT) with general correlated prior statistics. The proposed solution can be applied to any correlated statistical prior represented in trellis, e.g., finite state machines and Markov processes. We introduce a variation of List Viterbi Algorithm (LVA) to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than objectives, which efficiently gains from the correlated prior statistics structure. We also provide a sufficiency bound to the number of pooled tests required by any Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decoder with an arbitrary correlation between infected items. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Stage GT (MSGT) algorithm can obtain the optimal MAP performance with feasible complexity in practical regimes, such as with COVID-19 and sparse signal recovery applications, and reduce in the scenarios tested the number of pooled tests by at least 25% compared to existing classical low complexity GT algorithms. Moreover, we analytically characterize the complexity of the proposed MSGT algorithm that guarantees its efficiency.</description>

      <title>LLMs Outperform Experts on Challenging Biology Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with OpenAI's o3 now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP and LAB-Bench CloningScenarios. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.</description>
