      <title>Clustering Analysis of Long-term Cardiovascular Complications in COVID-19 Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates long-term cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients using advanced clustering techniques. The objective was to analyse ECG parameters, demographic data, comorbidities, and hospitalization details to identify patterns in cardiovascular health outcomes. We applied K-means clustering and identified three distinct clusters: Cluster 0 with moderate heart rate variability and ICU admissions, Cluster 1 with lower heart rate variability and ICU admissions, and Cluster 2 with higher heart rate variability and ICU admissions, indicating higher risk profiles.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Hypoglycemia Classification Across Multiple Prediction Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) management can be significantly enhanced through the use of predictive machine learning (ML) algorithms, which can mitigate the risk of adverse events like hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, characterized by blood glucose levels below 70 mg/dL, is a life-threatening condition typically caused by excessive insulin administration, missed meals, or physical activity. Its asymptomatic nature impedes timely intervention, making ML models crucial for early detection. This study integrates short- (up to 2h) and long-term (up to 24h) prediction horizons (PHs) within a single classification model to enhance decision support. The predicted times are 5-15 min, 15-30 min, 30 min-1h, 1-2h, 2-4h, 4-8h, 8-12h, and 12-24h before hypoglycemia. In addition, a simplified model classifying up to 4h before hypoglycemia is compared. We trained ResNet and LSTM models on glucose levels, insulin doses, and acceleration data. The results demonstrate the superiority of the LSTM models when classifying nine classes. In particular, subject-specific models yielded better performance but achieved high recall only for classes 0, 1, and 2 with 98%, 72%, and 50%, respectively. A population-based six-class model improved the results with at least 60% of events detected. In contrast, longer PHs remain challenging with the current approach and may be considered with different models.</description>

      <title>Improving Diseases Predictions Utilizing External Bio-Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has been successfully used in critical domains, such as medicine. However, extracting meaningful insights from biomedical data is often constrained by the lack of their available disease labels. In this research, we demonstrate how machine learning can be leveraged to enhance explainability and uncover biologically meaningful associations, even when predictive improvements in disease modeling are limited. We train LightGBM models from scratch on our dataset (10K) to impute metabolomics features and apply them to the UK Biobank (UKBB) for downstream analysis. The imputed metabolomics features are then used in survival analysis to assess their impact on disease-related risk factors. As a result, our approach successfully identified biologically relevant connections that were not previously known to the predictive models. Additionally, we applied a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on key metabolomics features, revealing a link between vascular dementia and smoking. Although being a well-established epidemiological relationship, this link was not embedded in the model's training data, which validated the method's ability to extract meaningful signals. Furthermore, by integrating survival models as inputs in the 10K data, we uncovered associations between metabolic substances and obesity, demonstrating the ability to infer disease risk for future patients without requiring direct outcome labels. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging external bio-banks to extract valuable biomedical insights, even in data-limited scenarios. Our results demonstrate that machine learning models trained on smaller datasets can still be used to uncover real biological associations when carefully integrated with survival analysis and genetic studies.</description>

      <title>EAP4EMSIG -- Enhancing Event-Driven Microscopy for Microfluidic Single-Cell Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic Live-Cell Imaging yields data on microbial cell factories. However, continuous acquisition is challenging as high-throughput experiments often lack realtime insights, delaying responses to stochastic events. We introduce three components in the Experiment Automation Pipeline for Event-Driven Microscopy to Smart Microfluidic Single-Cell Analysis: a fast, accurate Deep Learning autofocusing method predicting the focus offset, an evaluation of real-time segmentation methods and a realtime data analysis dashboard. Our autofocusing achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 0.0226\textmu m with inference times below 50~ms. Among eleven Deep Learning segmentation methods, Cellpose~3 reached a Panoptic Quality of 93.58\%, while a distance-based method is fastest (121~ms, Panoptic Quality 93.02\%). All six Deep Learning Foundation Models were unsuitable for real-time segmentation.</description>

      <title>Assessing Validity of ICD-10 Administrative Data in Coding Comorbidities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Administrative data is commonly used to inform chronic disease prevalence and support health informatics research. This study assessed the validity of coding comorbidity in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) administrative data. Methods: We analyzed three chart review cohorts (4,008 patients in 2003, 3,045 in 2015, and 9,024 in 2022) in Alberta, Canada. Nurse reviewers assessed the presence of 17 clinical conditions using a consistent protocol. The reviews were linked with administrative data using unique identifiers. We compared the accuracy in coding comorbidity by ICD-10, using chart review data as the reference standard. Results: Our findings showed that the mean difference in prevalence between chart reviews and ICD-10 for these 17 conditions was 2.1% in 2003, 7.6% in 2015, and 6.3% in 2022. Some conditions were relatively stable, such as diabetes (1.9%, 2.1%, and 1.1%) and metastatic cancer (0.3%, 1.1%, and 0.4%). For these 17 conditions, the sensitivity ranged from 39.6-85.1% in 2003, 1.3-85.2% in 2015, and 3.0-89.7% in 2022. The C-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality using comorbidities by ICD-10 were 0.84 in 2003, 0.81 in 2015, and 0.78 in 2022. Discussion: The under-coding could be primarily due to the increase of hospital patient volumes and the limited time allocated to coders. There is a potential to develop artificial intelligence methods based on electronic health records to support coding practices and improve coding quality. Conclusion: Comorbidities were increasingly under-coded over 20 years. The validity of ICD-10 decreased but remained relatively stable for certain conditions mandated for coding. The under-coding exerted minimal impact on in-hospital mortality prediction.</description>

      <title>Pharmacokinetic characteristics of Jinhong tablets in normal, chronic superficial gastritis and intestinal microbial disorder rats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jinhong tablet (JHT), a traditional Chinese medicine made from four herbs, effectively treats chronic superficial gastritis (CSG) by soothing the liver, relieving depression, regulating qi, and promoting blood circulation. However, its pharmacokinetics are underexplored. This study investigates JHT's pharmacokinetics in normal rats and its differences in normal, CSG, and intestinal microbial disorder rats. A quantitative method for seven active ingredients in rat plasma was established using UPLC-TQ-MS/MS. After administering various JHT doses, plasma concentrations were measured to assess pharmacokinetics in normal rats. The pharmacokinetics of four main ingredients were compared in normal, CSG, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) rats. Intestinal microbial changes were evaluated by high-throughput sequencing. Spearman correlation analysis linked ingredient exposure to gut microbiota disturbances. The method showed good linearity, precision, accuracy, extraction recovery, and stability. In normal rats, all seven ingredients were rapidly absorbed. Tetrahydropalmatine, corydaline, costunolide, and rhamnosylvitexin had good exposure, while dehydrocorydaline, allocryptopine, and palmatine hydrochloride had low exposure. Tetrahydropalmatine, corydaline, and costunolide followed linear pharmacokinetics (AUC0-t, Cmax) at doses of 0.7-5.6 g/kg, while rhamnosylvitexin and dehydrocorydaline showed linearity at 0.7-2.8 g/kg. In CSG and FMT rats, pharmacokinetic differences were observed. CSG enhanced costunolide exposure and Cmax, and increased rhamnosylvitexin exposure. FMT raised corydaline exposure and rhamnosylvitexin Cmax, linked to 20 bacterial genera.</description>

      <title>A DNA-Centric Mechanism for Protein Targeting in 6mA Methylation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How DNA-binding proteins locate specific genomic targets remains a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional protein-centric approaches, which rely on wet-lab experiments and visualization techniques, often lack genome-wide resolution and fail to capture physiological dynamics in living cells. Here, we introduce a DNA-centric strategy that leverages in vivo N6-methyladenine (6mA) data to decode the logic of protein-DNA recognition. By integrating linguistically inspired modeling with machine learning, we reveal two distinct search modes: a protein-driven diffusion mechanism and a DNA sequence-driven mechanism, wherein specific motifs function as protein traps. We further reconstruct high-resolution interaction landscapes at the level of individual sequences and trace the evolutionary trajectories of recognition motifs across species. This framework addresses fundamental limitations of protein-centered approaches and positions DNA itself as an intrinsic reporter of protein-binding behavior.</description>

      <title>Why risk matters for protein binder design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00146v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has recently become more prevalent in protein engineering applications and hence has become a fruitful target of benchmarks. However, current BO comparisons often overlook real-world considerations like risk and cost constraints. In this work, we compare 72 model combinations of encodings, surrogate models, and acquisition functions on 11 protein binder fitness landscapes, specifically from this perspective. Drawing from the portfolio optimization literature, we adopt metrics to quantify the cold-start performance relative to a random baseline, to assess the risk of an optimization campaign, and to calculate the overall budget required to reach a fitness threshold. Our results suggest the existence of Pareto-optimal models on the risk-performance axis, the shift of this preference depending on the landscape explored, and the robust correlation between landscape properties such as epistasis with the average and worst-case model performance. They also highlight that rigorous model selection requires substantial computational and statistical efforts.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Screening for Pancreatic Cancer using Computed Tomography Imaging and Radiology Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer, with most cases diagnosed at stage IV and a five-year overall survival rate below 5%. Early detection and prognosis modeling are crucial for improving patient outcomes and guiding early intervention strategies. In this study, we developed and evaluated a deep learning fusion model that integrates radiology reports and CT imaging to predict PDAC risk. The model achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.6750 (95% CI: 0.6429, 0.7121) and 0.6435 (95% CI: 0.6055, 0.6789) on the internal and external dataset, respectively, for 5-year survival risk estimation. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significant separation (p&lt;0.0001) between the low and high risk groups predicted by the fusion model. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning-based survival models in leveraging clinical and imaging data for pancreatic cancer.</description>

      <title>Graphical Models and Efficient Inference Methods for Multivariate Phase Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate phase relationships are important to characterize and understand numerous physical, biological, and chemical systems, from electromagnetic waves to neural oscillations. These systems exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics and intricate interdependencies among their constituent elements. While classical models of multivariate phase relationships, such as the wave equation and Kuramoto model, give theoretical models to describe phenomena, the development of statistical tools for hypothesis testing and inference for multivariate phase relationships in complex systems remains limited. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic modeling framework to characterize multivariate phase relationships, with wave-like phenomena serving as a key example. This approach describes spatial patterns and interactions between oscillators through a pairwise exponential family distribution. Building upon the literature of graphical model inference, including methods like Ising models, graphical lasso, and interaction screening, this work bridges the gap between classical wave dynamics and modern statistical approaches. Efficient inference methods are introduced, leveraging the Chow-Liu algorithm for directed tree approximations and interaction screening for general graphical models. Simulated experiments demonstrate the utility of these methods for uncovering wave properties and sparse interaction structures, highlighting their applicability to diverse scientific domains. This framework establishes a new paradigm for statistical modeling of multivariate phase relationships, providing a powerful toolset for exploring the complexity of these systems.</description>

      <title>Anti-pathogenic property of thermophile-fermented compost as a feed additive and its in vivo external diagnostic imaging in a fish model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermentation of organisms for recycling is important for the efficient cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus resources for a sustainable society, but the functionality of fermented products needs to be evaluated. Here, we clarify the anti-pathogenic properties for fish of a compost-type feed additive fermented by thermophilic Bacillaceae using non-edible marine resources as raw materials. After prior administration of the compost extract to seabream as a fish model for 70 days, the mortality rate after 28 days of exposure to the fish pathogen Edwardsiella reached a maximum of 20%, although the rate was 60% without prior administration. Under such conditions, the serum complement activity of seabream increased, and the recovery time after anesthesia treatment was also fasten. Furthermore, texture and HSV analysis using field photos statistically visualized differences in the degree of smoothness and gloss of the fish body surface depending on the administration. These results suggest that thermophile-fermented compost is effective as a functional feed additive against fish disease infection, and that such soundness can be estimated by body surface analysis. This study provides a new perspective for the natural symbiosis industry, as well as for the utilization of field non-invasive diagnosis to efficiently estimate the quality of its production activities.</description>
