      <title>Towards a fast and robust deep hedging approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust Deep Hedging framework for the pricing and hedging of option portfolios that significantly improves training efficiency and model robustness. In particular, we propose a neural model for training model embeddings which utilizes the paths of several advanced equity option models with stochastic volatility in order to learn the relationships that exist between hedging strategies. A key advantage of the proposed method is its ability to rapidly and reliably adapt to new market regimes through the recalibration of a low-dimensional embedding vector, rather than retraining the entire network. Moreover, we examine the observed Profit and Loss distributions on the parameter space of the models used to learn the embeddings. The results show that the proposed framework works well with data generated by complex models and can serve as a construction basis for an efficient and robust simulation tool for the systematic development of an entirely model-independent hedging strategy.</description>

      <title>Unbiased simulation of Asian options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an extension of the unbiased simulation method for SDEs developed in Henry-Labordere et al. [Ann Appl Probab. 27:6 (2017) 1-37] to a class of path-dependent dynamics, pertaining for Asian options. In our setting, both the payoff and the SDE's coefficients depend on the (weighted) average of the process or, more precisely, on the integral of the solution to the SDE against a continuous function with bounded variations. In particular, this applies to the numerical resolution of the class of path-dependent PDEs whose regularity, in the sens of Dupire, is studied in Bouchard and Tan [Ann. I.H.P., to appear].</description>

      <title>Modern Computational Methods in Reinsurance Optimization: From Simulated Annealing to Quantum Branch &amp; Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement modern computational methods to enhance catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts in practice. The underlying optimization problem involves attachment points, limits, and reinstatement clauses, and the objective is to maximize the expected profit while considering risk measures and regulatory constraints. We study the problem formulation, paving the way for practitioners, for two very different approaches: A local search optimizer using simulated annealing, which handles realistic constraints, and a branch &amp; bound approach exploring the potential of a future speedup via quantum branch &amp; bound. On the one hand, local search effectively generates contract structures within several constraints, proving useful for complex treaties that have multiple local optima. On the other hand, although our branch &amp; bound formulation only confirms that solving the full problem with a future quantum computer would require a stronger, less expensive bound and substantial hardware improvements, we believe that the designed application-specific bound is sufficiently strong to serve as a basis for further works. Concisely, we provide insurance practitioners with a robust numerical framework for contract optimization that handles realistic constraints today, as well as an outlook and initial steps towards an approach which could leverage quantum computers in the future.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Makers: A Stochastic Optimization Approach for Profitable Liquidity Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentrated liquidity automated market makers (AMMs), such as Uniswap v3, enable liquidity providers (LPs) to earn liquidity rewards by depositing tokens into liquidity pools. However, LPs often face significant financial losses driven by poorly selected liquidity provision intervals and high costs associated with frequent liquidity reallocation. To support LPs in achieving more profitable liquidity concentration, we developed a tractable stochastic optimization problem that can be used to compute optimal liquidity provision intervals for profitable liquidity provision. The developed problem accounts for the relationships between liquidity rewards, divergence loss, and reallocation costs. By formalizing optimal liquidity provision as a tractable stochastic optimization problem, we support a better understanding of the relationship between liquidity rewards, divergence loss, and reallocation costs. Moreover, the stochastic optimization problem offers a foundation for more profitable liquidity concentration.</description>

      <title>Bridging Econometrics and AI: VaR Estimation via Reinforcement Learning and GARCH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an environment of increasingly volatile financial markets, the accurate estimation of risk remains a major challenge. Traditional econometric models, such as GARCH and its variants, are based on assumptions that are often too rigid to adapt to the complexity of the current market dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation, combining GARCH volatility models with deep reinforcement learning. Our approach incorporates directional market forecasting using the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model, treating the task as an imbalanced classification problem. This architecture enables the dynamic adjustment of risk-level forecasts according to market conditions. Empirical validation on daily Eurostoxx 50 data covering periods of crisis and high volatility shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of VaR estimates, as well as a reduction in the number of breaches and also in capital requirements, while respecting regulatory risk thresholds. The ability of the model to adjust risk levels in real time reinforces its relevance to modern and proactive risk management.</description>

      <title>The deep multi-FBSDE method: a robust deep learning method for coupled FBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the deep multi-FBSDE method for robust approximation of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), focusing on cases where the deep BSDE method of Han, Jentzen, and E (2018) fails to converge. To overcome the convergence issues, we consider a family of FBSDEs that are equivalent to the original problem in the sense that they satisfy the same associated partial differential equation (PDE). Our algorithm proceeds in two phases: first, we approximate the initial condition for the FBSDE family, and second, we approximate the original FBSDE using the initial condition approximated in the first phase. Numerical experiments show that our method converges even when the standard deep BSDE method does not.</description>
