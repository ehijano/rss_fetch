      <title>Sequence Dependence of Critical Properties for 2-letter Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histogram-reweighting grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations are used to obtain the critical properties of lattice chains composed of solvophilic and solvophobic monomers. The model is a modification of one proposed by Larson \emph{et al.} [J. Chem. Phys. 83, 2411 (1985)], lowering the ``contrast'' between beads of different type to prevent aggregation into finite-size micelles that would mask true phase separation between bulk high- and low-density phases. Oligomeric chains of length between 5 and 24 beads are studied. Mixed-field finite-size scaling methods are used to obtain the critical properties with typical relative accuracies of better than $10^{-4}$ for the critical temperature and $10^{-3}$ for the critical volume fraction. Diblock chains are found to have lower critical temperatures and volume fractions relative to the corresponding homopolymers. Addition of solvophilic blocks of increasing length to a fixed-length solvophobic segment results in a decrease of both critical temperature and critical volume fraction, with an eventual slow asymptotic approach to the long-chain limiting behavior. Moving a single solvophobic or solvophilic bead along a chain leads to a minimum or maximum in the critical temperature, with no change in critical volume fraction. Chains of identical length and composition have a significant spread in their critical properties, depending on their precise sequence. The present study has implications on understanding biomolecular phase separation and for developing design rules for synthetic polymers with specific phase separation properties. It also provides data potentially useful for the further development of theoretical models for polymer and surfactant phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Mechanical memories in solids, from disorder to design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solids are rigid, which means that when left undisturbed, their structures are nearly static. It follows that these structures depend on history -- but it is surprising that they hold readable memories of past events. Here we review the research that has recently flourished around mechanical memory formation, beginning with amorphous solids' various memories of deformation and mesoscopic models based on particle rearrangements. We describe how these concepts apply to a much wider range of solids and glassy matter -- and how they are a bridge to memory and physical computing in mechanical metamaterials. An understanding of memory in all these solids can potentially be the basis for designing or training functionality into materials. Just as important is memory's value for understanding matter whenever it is complex, frustrated, and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Structural fluctuations in active glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The glassy dynamics of dense active matter have recently become a topic of interest due to their importance in biological processes such as wound healing and tissue development. However, while the liquid-state properties of dense active matter have been studied in relation to the glass transition of active matter, the solid-state properties of active glasses have yet to be understood. In this work, we study the structural fluctuations in the active glasses composed of self-propelled particles. We develop a formalism to describe the solid-state properties of active glasses in the harmonic approximation limit and use it to analyze the displacement fields in the active glasses. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of high-frequency normal modes become quasi-static with respect to the active forces, and consequently, excitations of these modes are significantly suppressed. This leads to a violation of the equipartition law, suppression of particle displacements, and the apparent collective motion of active glasses. Overall, our results provide a fundamental understanding of the solid-state properties of active glasses.</description>

      <title>Inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle in a non-linear velocity dependent friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the self-propulsion of an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle with a non-linear velocity dependent friction. Using analytical approach and numerical simulation, we have exactly investigated the dynamical behaviour of the particle in terms of particle trajectory, position and velocity distribution functions in both underdamped as well as overdamped regimes of the dynamics. Analyzing the distribution functions, we observe that for a confined harmonic particle, with an increase in duration of self-propulsion, the inertial particle prefers to accumulate near the boundary of the confinement rather than the mean position, reflecting an activity induced bistability in the presence of nonlinear friction. On the other hand, in the overdamped or highly viscous regime, where the inertial influence is negligible small, the sharp peak structure in the distribution across the mean position of the well reveals as usual trapping of the particle with increase in the persistent duration of activity. Moreover, for a free particle, using perturbation method, we have analytically computed the velocity distribution function in the vanishing limit of noise. The distribution interestingly shows the similar attributes as in case of a harmonic well, thus providing an additional effective confining mechanism that can be explained as a decreasing function of effective temperature. In this limit, the analytically computed distribution agrees well with the simulation results.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the dynamic slowdown in supercooled water: The role of dynamic disorder in jump motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a liquid is rapidly cooled below its melting point without inducing crystallization, its dynamics slow down significantly without noticeable structural changes. Elucidating the origin of this slowdown has been a long-standing challenge. Here, we report a theoretical investigation into the mechanism of the dynamic slowdown in supercooled water, a ubiquitous yet extraordinary substance characterized by various anomalous properties arising from local density fluctuations. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we found that the jump dynamics, which are elementary structural change processes, deviate from Poisson statistics with decreasing temperature. This deviation is attributed to slow variables competing with the jump motions, i.e., dynamic disorder. The present analysis of the dynamic disorder showed that the primary slow variable is the displacement of the fourth nearest oxygen atom of a jumping molecule, which occurs in an environment created by the fluctuations of molecules outside the first hydration shell. As the temperature decreases, the jump dynamics become slow and intermittent. These intermittent dynamics are attributed to the prolonged trapping of jumping molecules within extended and stable low-density domains. As the temperature continues to decrease, the number of slow variables increases due to the increased cooperative motions. Consequently, the jump dynamics proceed in a higher-dimensional space consisting of multiple slow variables, becoming slower and more intermittent. It is then conceivable that with further decreasing temperature, the slowing and intermittency of the jump dynamics intensify, eventually culminating in a glass transition.</description>

      <title>Influence of Organic Molecules and Phosphate Ions on the Formation of Biosilica Patterns in Diatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of regularly structured silica valves in diatoms is a captivating process in biomineralization. Specific organic molecules, including long-chain polyamines, silaffins, and silacidins, have been found to be essential in this process. The molecular structure of synthesized polyamines greatly affects the quantity, size, and shape of silica precipitates. Experimental findings indicate that silica precipitation occurs at specific concentrations of phosphate ions, with higher concentrations resulting in larger aggregates of organic molecules that serve as templates for silica formation.
  Our study focuses on the hypothesis that pattern formation in diatom valve structures is driven by the phase separation of species-specific organic molecules, with the evolving organic structures acting as templates for silica deposition. We specifically investigate the role of phosphate ions in the self-assembly of long-chain polyamines and analyze how their reaction with organic molecules impacts the morphology of the organic template. By varying the model parameters, including degree of dissociation and initial concentrations of reacting components, we show that the resulting geometric features of the patterns are highly dependent on these factors.
  Furthermore, we explore the scenario where an initial array of organic droplets serves as a static template for silica deposition, considering the effects of "prepatterning" by the silica costae in the base layer. We obtain numerical solutions that generate a diverse range of two-dimensional patterns closely resembling the valve structures observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>The Flux Hypothesis for Odd Transport Phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onsager's regression hypothesis makes a fundamental connection between macroscopic transport phenomena and the average relaxation of spontaneous microscopic fluctuations. This relaxation, however, is agnostic to odd transport phenomena, in which fluxes run orthogonal to the gradients driving them. To account for odd transport, we generalize the regression hypothesis, postulating that macroscopic linear constitutive laws are, on average, obeyed by microscopic fluctuations, whether they contribute to relaxation or not. From this "flux hypothesis," Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations follow, elucidating the separate roles of broken time-reversal and parity symmetries underlying various odd transport coefficients. As an application, we derive and verify the Green-Kubo relation for odd collective diffusion in chiral active matter, first in an analytically-tractable model and subsequently through molecular dynamics simulations of concentrated active spinners.</description>

      <title>Yielding transition of amorphous solids in the presence of aspherical impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical properties of amorphous solids is a crucial area of research due to the fascinating phenomena they exhibit under external deformations and their importance in industrial applications. Although these solids have higher yield strength compared to crystalline solids of similar composition, they often fail catastrophically through shear band formation. Tuning their mechanical behavior is vital for material design. Engineers have long been seeking ways to improve the ability of amorphous solids to withstand external deformations, with micro-alloying being a popular method. By adding small amounts of different materials to pure samples, microalloying can enhance yield strain, although the microscopic mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. We conducted a study with extensive molecular dynamics simulations on model amorphous solids to investigate the effect of asphericity of the impurity particles on their yielding behaviour. Our results indicate that aspherical impurities free to rotate can significantly increase the yield threshold. Conversely, when impurities are unable to rotate, they can lead to the formationof extremely brittle, ultrastable-like systems. The rotational degrees of freedom are controlled bychanging the aspect ratio of the impurity,and they play a crucial role in influencing shear bandformation. Additionally, we found that including larger impurities enhances the structural stabilityof the parent glass matrix.</description>

      <title>Toward Modeling the Structure of Electrolytes at Charged Mineral Interfaces using Classical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The organization of water molecules and ions between charged mineral surfaces determines the stability of colloidal suspensions and the strength of phase-separated particulate gels. In this article we assemble a density functional that measures the free energy due to the interaction of water molecules and ions near electric double layers. The model accounts for the finite size of the particles using fundamental measure theory, hydrogen-bonding between water molecules using Wertheim's statistical association theory, long-range dispersion interactions using Barker and Henderson's high temperature expansion, electrostatic correlations using a functionalized mean-spherical approximation, and Coulomb forces through the Poisson equation. These contributions are shown to produce highly correlated structures, aptly rendering the layering of counter-ions and co-ions at highly charged surfaces, and permitting the solvation of ions and surfaces to be measured by a combination of short-ranged association and long-ranged attraction. The model is tested in a planar geometry near soft, charged surfaces to reproduce the structure of water near graphene and mica. For mica surfaces, explicitly representing the density of the outer oxygen layer of the exposed silica tetrahedra in the domain permits water molecules to hydrogen-bind to the surface. When electrostatic interactions are included, water molecules assume a hybrid character, being accounted for implicitly in the dielectric constant but explicitly otherwise. The disjoining pressure between approaching like-charged surfaces is calculated, demonstrating the model's ability to probe pressure oscillations that arise during the expulsion of ions and water layers from the interfacial gap, and predict the strong inter-attractive stresses that form at narrow interfacial spacing when the surface charge is overscreened.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of stochastic state transitions in Langevin systems with odd elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active microscopic objects, e.g., an enzyme molecule, are modeled by the Langevin system with the odd elasticity, in which energy injection from the substrate to the enzyme is described by the antisymmetric part of the elastic matrix. By applying the Onsager--Machlup integral and large deviation theory to the Langevin system with odd elasticity, we can calculate the cumulant generating function of the irreversibility of the state transition. For an $N$-component system, we obtain a formal expression of the cumulant generating function and demonstrate that the oddness $\lambda$, which quantifies the antisymmetric part of the elastic matrix, leads to higher-order cumulants that do not appear in a passive elastic system. To demonstrate the effect of the oddness under the concrete parameter, we analyze the simplest two-component system and obtain the optimal transition path and cumulant generating function. The cumulants obtained from expansion of the cumulant generating function increase monotonically with the oddness. This implies that the oddness causes the uncertainty of stochastic state transitions.</description>

Abstract: The intrinsic Helmholtz free-energy functional, the centerpiece of classical density functional theory (cDFT), is at best only known approximately for 3D systems. Here we introduce a method for learning a quasi-exact neural-network approximation of this functional by exclusively training on a dataset of radial distribution functions, circumventing the need to sample costly heterogeneous density profiles in a wide variety of external potentials. For a supercritical 3D Lennard-Jones system, we demonstrate that the learned neural free-energy functional accurately predicts planar inhomogeneous density profiles under various complex external potentials obtained from simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply optimal control theory to a model of a polar active fluid (the Toner-Tu model), with the objective of driving the system into particular emergent dynamical behaviors or programming switching between states on demand. We use the effective self-propulsion speed as the control parameter (i.e. the means of external actuation). We identify control protocols that achieve outcomes such as relocating asters to targeted positions, forcing propagating solitary waves to reorient to a particular direction, and switching between stationary asters and propagating fronts. We analyze the solutions to identify generic principles for controlling polar active fluids. Our findings have implications for achieving spatiotemporal control of active polar systems in experiments, particularly in vitro cytoskeletal systems. Additionally, this research paves the way for leveraging optimal control methods to engineer the structure and dynamics of active fluids more broadly.</description>

      <title>Casimir force within Ising chain with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the one-dimensional Ising model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's) and long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model, also known as the Nagle-Kardar model, exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is repulsive near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming attractive, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion. This represents a violation of the widely-accepted "boundary condition rule", which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's independently of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>
