      <title>Quality-aware Masked Diffusion Transformer for Enhanced Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) generation has gained prominence, offering a novel approach to synthesizing musical content from textual descriptions. Achieving high accuracy and diversity in this generation process requires extensive, high-quality data, which often constitutes only a fraction of available datasets. Within open-source datasets, the prevalence of issues like mislabeling, weak labeling, unlabeled data, and low-quality music waveform significantly hampers the development of music generation models. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel quality-aware masked diffusion transformer (QA-MDT) approach that enables generative models to discern the quality of input music waveform during training. Building on the unique properties of musical signals, we have adapted and implemented a MDT model for TTM task, while further unveiling its distinct capacity for quality control. Moreover, we address the issue of low-quality captions with a caption refinement data processing approach. Our demo page is shown in https://qa-mdt.github.io/.

      <title>Carnatic Raga Identification System using Rigorous Time-Delay Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large scale machine learning-based Raga identification continues to be a nontrivial issue in the computational aspects behind Carnatic music. Each raga consists of many unique and intrinsic melodic patterns that can be used to easily identify them from others. These ragas can also then be used to cluster songs within the same raga, as well as identify songs in other closely related ragas. In this case, the input sound is analyzed using a combination of steps including using a Discrete Fourier transformation and using Triangular Filtering to create custom bins of possible notes, extracting features from the presence of particular notes or lack thereof. Using a combination of Neural Networks including 1D Convolutional Neural Networks conventionally known as Time-Delay Neural Networks) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which are a form of Recurrent Neural Networks, the backbone of the classification strategy to build the model can be created. In addition, to help with variations in shruti, a long-time attention-based mechanism will be implemented to determine the relative changes in frequency rather than the absolute differences. This will provide a much more meaningful data point when training audio clips in different shrutis. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifier, a dataset of 676 recordings is used. The songs are distributed across the list of ragas. The goal of this program is to be able to effectively and efficiently label a much wider range of audio clips in more shrutis, ragas, and with more background noise.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Charlie Parker Omnibook using an audio-to-score automatic transcription pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Charlie Parker Omnibook is a cornerstone of jazz music education, described by pianist Ethan Iverson as "the most important jazz education text ever published". In this work we propose a new transcription pipeline and explore the extent to which state of the art music technology is able to reconstruct these scores directly from the audio without human intervention. Our pipeline includes: a newly trained source separation model for saxophone, a new MIDI transcription model for solo saxophone and an adaptation of an existing MIDI-to-score method for monophonic instruments.
  To assess this pipeline we also provide an enhanced dataset of Charlie Parker transcriptions as score-audio pairs with accurate MIDI alignments and downbeat annotations. This represents a challenging new benchmark for automatic audio-to-score transcription that we hope will advance research into areas beyond transcribing audio-to-MIDI alone.
  Together, these form another step towards producing scores that musicians can use directly, without the need for onerous corrections or revisions. To facilitate future research, all model checkpoints and data are made available to download along with code for the transcription pipeline. Improvements in our modular pipeline could one day make the automatic transcription of complex jazz solos a routine possibility, thereby enriching the resources available for music education and preservation.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Voice Activity Detection Based On Lightweight Neural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) is the task of detecting speech in an audio stream, which is challenging due to numerous unseen noises and low signal-to-noise ratios in real environments. Recently, neural network-based VADs have alleviated the degradation of performance to some extent. However, the majority of existing studies have employed excessively large models and incorporated future context, while neglecting to evaluate the operational efficiency and latency of the models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and real-time neural network called MagicNet, which utilizes casual and depth separable 1-D convolutions and GRU. Without relying on future features as input, our proposed model is compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms on synthesized in-domain and out-domain test datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate that MagicNet can achieve improved performance and robustness with fewer parameter costs.</description>

      <title>RSET: Remapping-based Sorting Method for Emotion Transfer Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although current Text-To-Speech (TTS) models are able to generate high-quality speech samples, there are still challenges in developing emotion intensity controllable TTS. Most existing TTS models achieve emotion intensity control by extracting intensity information from reference speeches. Unfortunately, limited by the lack of modeling for intra-class emotion intensity and the model's information decoupling capability, the generated speech cannot achieve fine-grained emotion intensity control and suffers from information leakage issues. In this paper, we propose an emotion transfer TTS model, which defines a remapping-based sorting method to model intra-class relative intensity information, combined with Mutual Information (MI) to decouple speaker and emotion information, and synthesizes expressive speeches with perceptible intensity differences. Experiments show that our model achieves fine-grained emotion control while preserving speaker information.</description>

      <title>A Novel Fusion Architecture for PD Detection Using Semi-Supervised Speech Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to recognize Parkinson's disease (PD) through an English pangram utterance speech collected using a web application from diverse recording settings and environments, including participants' homes. Our dataset includes a global cohort of 1306 participants, including 392 diagnosed with PD. Leveraging the diversity of the dataset, spanning various demographic properties (such as age, sex, and ethnicity), we used deep learning embeddings derived from semi-supervised models such as Wav2Vec 2.0, WavLM, and ImageBind representing the speech dynamics associated with PD. Our novel fusion model for PD classification, which aligns different speech embeddings into a cohesive feature space, demonstrated superior performance over standard concatenation-based fusion models and other baselines (including models built on traditional acoustic features). In a randomized data split configuration, the model achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 88.94% and an accuracy of 85.65%. Rigorous statistical analysis confirmed that our model performs equitably across various demographic subgroups in terms of sex, ethnicity, and age, and remains robust regardless of disease duration. Furthermore, our model, when tested on two entirely unseen test datasets collected from clinical settings and from a PD care center, maintained AUROC scores of 82.12% and 78.44%, respectively. This affirms the model's robustness and it's potential to enhance accessibility and health equity in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Music Genre Classification through Multi-Algorithm Analysis and User-Friendly Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to teach an algorithm how to recognize different types of music. Users will submit songs for analysis. Since the algorithm hasn't heard these songs before, it needs to figure out what makes each song unique. It does this by breaking down the songs into different parts and studying things like rhythm, melody, and tone via supervised learning because the program learns from examples that are already labelled. One important thing to consider when classifying music is its genre, which can be quite complex. To ensure accuracy, we use five different algorithms, each working independently, to analyze the songs. This helps us get a more complete understanding of each song's characteristics. Therefore, our goal is to correctly identify the genre of each submitted song. Once the analysis is done, the results are presented using a graphing tool, making it easy for users to understand and provide feedback.</description>

      <title>Spiketrum: An FPGA-based Implementation of a Neuromorphic Cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging the general-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum. The focus of this study is on the development and characterization of this cochlea model, which excels in transforming audio vibrations into biologically realistic auditory spike trains. These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea's ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description>

      <title>C3LLM: Conditional Multimodal Content Generation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce C3LLM (Conditioned-on-Three-Modalities Large Language Models), a novel framework combining three tasks of video-to-audio, audio-to-text, and text-to-audio together. C3LLM adapts the Large Language Model (LLM) structure as a bridge for aligning different modalities, synthesizing the given conditional information, and making multimodal generation in a discrete manner. Our contributions are as follows. First, we adapt a hierarchical structure for audio generation tasks with pre-trained audio codebooks. Specifically, we train the LLM to generate audio semantic tokens from the given conditions, and further use a non-autoregressive transformer to generate different levels of acoustic tokens in layers to better enhance the fidelity of the generated audio. Second, based on the intuition that LLMs were originally designed for discrete tasks with the next-word prediction method, we use the discrete representation for audio generation and compress their semantic meanings into acoustic tokens, similar to adding "acoustic vocabulary" to LLM. Third, our method combines the previous tasks of audio understanding, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation together into one unified model, providing more versatility in an end-to-end fashion. Our C3LLM achieves improved results through various automated evaluation metrics, providing better semantic alignment compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Crossmodal ASR Error Correction with Discrete Speech Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ASR remains unsatisfactory in scenarios where the speaking style diverges from that used to train ASR systems, resulting in erroneous transcripts. To address this, ASR Error Correction (AEC), a post-ASR processing approach, is required. In this work, we tackle an understudied issue: the Low-Resource Out-of-Domain (LROOD) problem, by investigating crossmodal AEC on very limited downstream data with 1-best hypothesis transcription. We explore pre-training and fine-tuning strategies and uncover an ASR domain discrepancy phenomenon, shedding light on appropriate training schemes for LROOD data. Moreover, we propose the incorporation of discrete speech units to align with and enhance the word embeddings for improving AEC quality. Results from multiple corpora and several evaluation metrics demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of our proposed AEC approach on LROOD data, as well as its generalizability and superiority on large-scale data. Finally, a study on speech emotion recognition confirms that our model produces ASR error-robust transcripts suitable for downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Sok: Comprehensive Security Overview, Challenges, and Future Directions of Voice-Controlled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Voice Control Systems (VCS) into smart devices and their growing presence in daily life accentuate the importance of their security. Current research has uncovered numerous vulnerabilities in VCS, presenting significant risks to user privacy and security. However, a cohesive and systematic examination of these vulnerabilities and the corresponding solutions is still absent. This lack of comprehensive analysis presents a challenge for VCS designers in fully understanding and mitigating the security issues within these systems.
  Addressing this gap, our study introduces a hierarchical model structure for VCS, providing a novel lens for categorizing and analyzing existing literature in a systematic manner. We classify attacks based on their technical principles and thoroughly evaluate various attributes, such as their methods, targets, vectors, and behaviors. Furthermore, we consolidate and assess the defense mechanisms proposed in current research, offering actionable recommendations for enhancing VCS security. Our work makes a significant contribution by simplifying the complexity inherent in VCS security, aiding designers in effectively identifying and countering potential threats, and setting a foundation for future advancements in VCS security research.</description>

      <title>HiddenSpeaker: Generate Imperceptible Unlearnable Audios for Speaker Verification System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable advancements in deep neural networks have brought tremendous convenience. However, the training process of a highly effective model necessitates a substantial quantity of samples, which brings huge potential threats, like unauthorized exploitation with privacy leakage. In response, we propose a framework named HiddenSpeaker, embedding imperceptible perturbations within the training speech samples and rendering them unlearnable for deep-learning-based speaker verification systems that employ large-scale speakers for efficient training. The HiddenSpeaker utilizes a simplified error-minimizing method named Single-Level Error-Minimizing (SLEM) to generate specific and effective perturbations. Additionally, a hybrid objective function is employed for human perceptual optimization, ensuring the perturbation is indistinguishable from human listeners. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the speaker verification domain to evaluate HiddenSpeaker. Our results demonstrate that HiddenSpeaker not only deceives the model with unlearnable samples but also enhances the imperceptibility of the perturbations, showcasing strong transferability across different models.</description>

      <title>SoundShift: Exploring Sound Manipulations for Accessible Mixed-Reality Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-reality (MR) soundscapes blend real-world sound with virtual audio from hearing devices, presenting intricate auditory information that is hard to discern and differentiate. This is particularly challenging for blind or visually impaired individuals, who rely on sounds and descriptions in their everyday lives. To understand how complex audio information is consumed, we analyzed online forum posts within the blind community, identifying prevailing challenges, needs, and desired solutions. We synthesized the results and propose SoundShift for increasing MR sound awareness, which includes six sound manipulations: Transparency Shift, Envelope Shift, Position Shift, Style Shift, Time Shift, and Sound Append. To evaluate the effectiveness of SoundShift, we conducted a user study with 18 blind participants across three simulated MR scenarios, where participants identified specific sounds within intricate soundscapes. We found that SoundShift increased MR sound awareness and minimized cognitive load. Finally, we developed three real-world example applications to demonstrate the practicality of SoundShift.</description>

      <title>BAT: Learning to Reason about Spatial Sounds with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial sound reasoning is a fundamental human skill, enabling us to navigate and interpret our surroundings based on sound. In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments.</description>
