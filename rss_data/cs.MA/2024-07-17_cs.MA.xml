      <title>Map of Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main contribution is the introduction of the map of elections framework. A map of elections consists of three main elements: (1) a dataset of elections (i.e., collections of ordinal votes over given sets of candidates), (2) a way of measuring similarities between these elections, and (3) a representation of the elections in the 2D Euclidean space as points, so that the more similar two elections are, the closer are their points. In our maps, we mostly focus on datasets of synthetic elections, but we also show an example of a map over real-life ones. To measure similarities, we would have preferred to use, e.g., the isomorphic swap distance, but this is infeasible due to its high computational complexity. Hence, we propose polynomial-time computable positionwise distance and use it instead. Regarding the representations in 2D Euclidean space, we mostly use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, but we also show two alternatives.
  We develop the necessary theoretical results to form our maps and argue experimentally that they are accurate and credible. Further, we show how coloring the elections in a map according to various criteria helps in analyzing results of a number of experiments. In particular, we show colorings according to the scores of winning candidates or committees, running times of ILP-based winner determination algorithms, and approximation ratios achieved by particular algorithms.</description>

      <title>Geode: A Zero-shot Geospatial Question-Answering Agent with Explicit Reasoning and Precise Spatio-Temporal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11014</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in learning and contextualizing information from different forms of data. Recent advancements in foundational models, particularly those employing self-attention mechanisms, have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehend the semantics of diverse data types. One such area that could highly benefit from multi-modality is in understanding geospatial data, which inherently has multiple modalities. However, current Natural Language Processing (NLP) mechanisms struggle to effectively address geospatial queries. Existing pre-trained LLMs are inadequately equipped to meet the unique demands of geospatial data, lacking the ability to retrieve precise spatio-temporal data in real-time, thus leading to significantly reduced accuracy in answering complex geospatial queries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geode--a pioneering system designed to tackle zero-shot geospatial question-answering tasks with high precision using spatio-temporal data retrieval. Our approach represents a significant improvement in addressing the limitations of current LLM models, demonstrating remarkable improvement in geospatial question-answering abilities compared to existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Time Shift Governor for Constrained Control of Spacecraft Orbit and Attitude Relative Motion in Bicircular Restricted Four-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers constrained spacecraft rendezvous and docking (RVD) in the setting of the Bicircular Restricted Four-Body Problem (BCR4BP), while accounting for attitude dynamics. We consider Line of Sight (LoS) cone constraints, thrust limits, thrust direction limits, and approach velocity constraints during RVD missions in a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) in the Sun-Earth-Moon system. To enforce the constraints, the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which uses a time-shifted Chief spacecraft trajectory as a target reference for the Deputy spacecraft, is employed. The time shift is gradually reduced to zero so that the virtual target gradually evolves towards the Chief spacecraft as time goes by, and the RVD mission objective can be achieved. Numerical simulation results are reported to validate the proposed control method.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Altruistic Perversity in Two-Strategy Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-interested behavior from individuals can collectively lead to poor societal outcomes. These outcomes can seemingly be improved through the actions of altruistic agents, which benefit other agents in the system. However, it is known in specific contexts that altruistic agents can actually induce worse outcomes compared to a fully selfish population -- a phenomenon we term altruistic perversity. This paper provides a holistic investigation into the necessary conditions that give rise to altruistic perversity. In particular, we study the class of two-strategy population games where one sub-population is altruistic and the other is selfish. We find that a population game can admit altruistic perversity only if the associated social welfare function is convex and the altruistic population is sufficiently large. Our results are a first step in establishing a connection between properties of nominal agent interactions and the potential impacts from altruistic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Navigating the swarm: Deep neural networks command emergent behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting individuals in complex systems often give rise to coherent motion exhibiting coordinated global structures. Such phenomena are ubiquitously observed in nature, from cell migration, bacterial swarms, animal and insect groups, and even human societies. Primary mechanisms responsible for the emergence of collective behavior have been extensively identified, including local alignments based on average or relative velocity, non-local pairwise repulsive-attractive interactions such as distance-based potentials, interplay between local and non-local interactions, and cognitive-based inhomogeneous interactions. However, discovering how to adapt these mechanisms to modulate emergent behaviours remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate coordinated structures in collective behavior at desired moments with intended global patterns by fine-tuning an inter-agent interaction rule. Our strategy employs deep neural networks, obeying the laws of dynamics, to find interaction rules that command desired collective structures. The decomposition of interaction rules into distancing and aligning forces, expressed by polynomial series, facilitates the training of neural networks to propose desired interaction models. Presented examples include altering the mean radius and size of clusters in vortical swarms, timing of transitions from random to ordered states, and continuously shifting between typical modes of collective motions. This strategy can even be leveraged to superimpose collective modes, resulting in hitherto unexplored but highly practical hybrid collective patterns, such as protective security formations. Our findings reveal innovative strategies for creating and controlling collective motion, paving the way for new applications in robotic swarm operations, active matter organisation, and for the uncovering of obscure interaction rules in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to Imitate Spatial Organization in Multi-robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding collective behavior and how it evolves is important to ensure that robot swarms can be trusted in a shared environment. One way to understand the behavior of the swarm is through collective behavior reconstruction using prior demonstrations. Existing approaches often require access to the swarm controller which may not be available. We reconstruct collective behaviors in distinct swarm scenarios involving shared environments without using swarm controller information. We achieve this by transforming prior demonstrations into features that sufficiently describe multi-agent interactions before behavior reconstruction with multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MA-GAIL). We show that our approach outperforms existing algorithms in all investigated swarm scenarios, and can be used to observe and reconstruct a swarm's behavior for further analysis and testing, which might be impractical or undesirable on the original robot swarm.</description>

      <title>Attrition-Aware Adaptation for Multi-Agent Patrolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent patrolling is a key problem in a variety of domains such as intrusion detection, area surveillance, and policing which involves repeated visits by a group of agents to specified points in an environment. While the problem is well-studied, most works do not provide performance guarantees and either do not consider agent attrition or impose significant communication requirements to enable adaptation. In this work, we present the Adaptive Heuristic-based Patrolling Algorithm, which is capable of adaptation to agent loss using minimal communication by taking advantage of Voronoi partitioning, and which meets guaranteed performance bounds. Additionally, we provide new centralized and distributed mathematical programming formulations of the patrolling problem, analyze the properties of Voronoi partitioning, and finally, show the value of our adaptive heuristic algorithm by comparison with various benchmark algorithms using physical robots and simulation based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2.</description>

      <title>A Single Online Agent Can Efficiently Learn Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) are a promising framework for modeling the behavior of large-population systems. However, solving MFGs can be challenging due to the coupling of forward population evolution and backward agent dynamics. Typically, obtaining mean field Nash equilibria (MFNE) involves an iterative approach where the forward and backward processes are solved alternately, known as fixed-point iteration (FPI). This method requires fully observed population propagation and agent dynamics over the entire spatial domain, which could be impractical in some real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel online single-agent model-free learning scheme, which enables a single agent to learn MFNE using online samples, without prior knowledge of the state-action space, reward function, or transition dynamics. Specifically, the agent updates its policy through the value function (Q), while simultaneously evaluating the mean field state (M), using the same batch of observations. We develop two variants of this learning scheme: off-policy and on-policy QM iteration. We prove that they efficiently approximate FPI, and a sample complexity guarantee is provided. The efficacy of our methods is confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>
