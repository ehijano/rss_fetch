      <title>Quantum three-rotor problem in the identity representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum three-rotor problem concerns the dynamics of three equally massive particles moving on a circle subject to pairwise attractive cosine potentials and can model coupled Josephson junctions. Classically, it displays order-chaos-order behavior with increasing energy. The quantum system admits a dimensionless coupling with semiclassical behavior at strong coupling. We study stationary states with periodic `relative' wave functions. Perturbative and harmonic approximations capture the spectrum at weak coupling and that of low-lying states at strong coupling. More generally, the cumulative distribution of energy levels obtained by numerical diagonalization is well-described by a Weyl-like semiclassical estimate. However, the system has an $S_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is obscured when working with relative angles. By exploiting a basis for invariant states, we obtain the purified spectrum in the identity representation. To uncover universal quantum hallmarks of chaos, we partition the spectrum into energy windows where the classical motion is regular, mixed or chaotic and unfold each separately. At strong coupling, we find striking signatures of transitions between regularity and chaos: spacing distributions morph from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson while the number variance shifts from linear to logarithmic behavior at small lengths. Some nonuniversal features are also examined. For instance, the number variance saturates and oscillates at large lengths for strong coupling while deviations from Poisson spacings at asymptotically low and high energies are well-explained by purified quantum harmonic and free-rotor spectra at strong and weak coupling. Interestingly, the degeneracy of free-rotor levels admits an elegant formula that we deduce using properties of Eisenstein primes.</description>

      <title>Natural Selection and Random Matrix Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will study the relationship between two well-known theories, genetic evolution and random matrix theory in the context of many-body systems. It is suggested that genetic evolution can be described by a random matrix theory with statistical distribution in which natural selection acts as a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition.</description>

      <title>Dynamical System Identification, Model Selection and Model Uncertainty Quantification by Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a Bayesian maximum \textit{a~posteriori} (MAP) framework for dynamical system identification from time-series data. This is shown to be equivalent to a generalized Tikhonov regularization, providing a rational justification for the choice of the residual and regularization terms, respectively, from the negative logarithms of the likelihood and prior distributions. In addition to the estimation of model coefficients, the Bayesian interpretation gives access to the full apparatus for Bayesian inference, including the ranking of models, the quantification of model uncertainties and the estimation of unknown (nuisance) hyperparameters. Two Bayesian algorithms, joint maximum \textit{a~posteriori} (JMAP) and variational Bayesian approximation (VBA), are compared to the {LASSO, ridge regression and SINDy algorithms for sparse} regression, by application to several dynamical systems with added {Gaussian or Laplace} noise. For multivariate Gaussian likelihood and prior distributions, the Bayesian formulation gives Gaussian posterior and evidence distributions, in which the numerator terms can be expressed in terms of the Mahalanobis distance or ``Gaussian norm'' $||\vec{y}-\hat{\vec{y}}||^2_{M^{-1}} = (\vec{y}-\hat{\vec{y}})^\top {M^{-1}} (\vec{y}-\hat{\vec{y}})$, where $\vec{y}$ is a vector variable, $\hat{\vec{y}}$ is its estimator and $M$ is the covariance matrix. The posterior Gaussian norm is shown to provide a robust metric for quantitative model selection {for the different systems and noise models examined.}</description>
