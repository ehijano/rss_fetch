      <title>A New Cloud of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we generalize the cloud of strings model originally introduced by Letelier~\cite{Letelier:1979ej} by incorporating a \textit{magnetic-like component}, $\Sigma_{23}$, alongside the \textit{electric-like component}, $\Sigma_{01}$, considered in the original model. This extension yields a uniquely determined stress-energy tensor of the form $\mathrm{diag}(\rho, -\rho, p, p)$, governed by a specific equation of state and parameterized by two constants. The resulting black hole solution exhibits significant modifications, including the presence of \textit{two independent hairs}, distinguishing it from classical no-hair solutions. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of this black hole and demonstrate the existence of a \textit{remnant mass} and finite entropy at the end of the Hawking evaporation process, suggesting a stable end-state. Furthermore, the presence of \textit{two hairs} introduces new features that could influence black hole shadows and gravitational wave signals, offering valuable observational signatures for testing these exotic configurations.</description>

      <title>Brill Waves with Slow Fall-Off Towards Spatial Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute families of solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations of the type of Brill waves, but with slow fall-off towards spatial infinity. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for physical data and numerically construct some representative solutions. We numerically construct an explicit example with slow-off which does not exhibit antipodal symmetry at spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>Towards a realistic Buchdahl limit in f(R) theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called Buchdahl limit is not yet fully understood in the context of theories of gravity beyond the Einsteinian framework. In this investigation, we generalize this limit for the case of static, spherically-symmetric, relativistic compact stars in f(R) theories of gravity within the metric formalism. We present a comprehensive analysis that ensures regularity, thermodynamic stability, fulfillment of all required junction conditions, recovery of the Newtonian potential at long distances and a correct extraction of the asymptotic mass. Our results are exemplified for the f(R)=R+ alpha R^2 Starobinsky model and several realistic equations of state describing neutron-star matter. We also compare these results with the case of compact stars immersed ad hoc in an Schwarzschild exterior vacuum, although this scenario does not fulfill all necessary f(R) junction conditions. To test the validity of viable f(R) models, we show that such stars can indeed host additional energetic content, so their gravitational redshift can be greater than 2, which is prohibited in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous model with a space dependent Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse an inhomogeneous cosmological model featuring a spherically symmetric bubble solution induced by a unified single perfect fluid, comprising spatially dependent Dark Energy (with $w=-1$) and Dark Matter (with $w=0$) components. We impose an Hubble profile that matches the Planck value at early times ($H_0=67.4\pm0.5$ Km/s\,Mpc) and the local value (${\cal H}_0=73.52\pm 1.62$ Km/s\,Mpc). We explicitly derive perturbative solutions in two distinct regimes: one expanded around the center (for small $r\,{\cal H}_0\ll1$) and the other expanded around a homogeneous FRW universe. In both cases, we compute the cosmographic parameters, redshift profiles for the Hubbles expansion rates, and effective equations of state. Furthermore, we investigate the redshift drift behaviour extended to a Lema$\hat{\rm i}$tre metric.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers of Neutron Stars in Horndeski Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements of the gravitational wave signal from compact binary inspirals allow us to constrain the internal structure of those objects via physical parameters such as the tidal Love numbers. In scalar-tensor theories, one typically finds new types of Love numbers that are usually not considered or simply absent in General Relativity, which further allows us to constrain deviations from General Relativity. Building upon previous results, we present the linear perturbation equations necessary to calculate static and even-parity tidal Love numbers in Horndeski theories, the most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order field equations of motion. We further focus on the quadrupolar Love numbers and demonstrate how these can be extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields. We find that there is a potential ambiguity in extracting the Love numbers in this way, which we resolve by performing supplementary calculations in the effective field theory framework. We show that, in the case of scalar-tensor theories, the tidal Love numbers are not directly given by the $1/r^3$ term in the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields, as there is an additional contribution to this term independent of the Love numbers. We calculate such a contribution for a minimally coupled scalar field and also for the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese model. For the latter, we find that the Love numbers can differ by $\mathcal{O}(1 \sim 10)\,\%$, if this additional contribution is not taken into account.</description>

      <title>Geodesic deviation in the $q$-metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the tidal forces between test particles falling along geodesics in the exterior spacetime generated by a static and axially symmetric compact matter source with non-vanishing mass quadrupole. Specifically, we analyze the radial and angular geodesic deviation, compare it with that of the Schwarzschild spacetime, and investigate the impact of the deformation parameter $q$, at different polar angles $\theta$ with respect to the vertical symmetry axis. Furthermore, we examine the geodesic deviation for the case of non-constant $\theta$ during the radial fall. It is shown that the presence of the deformation parameter affects the behavior of the geodesic deviation vectors, depending on its value. In particular, we observe that for arbitrary values of $q$ and $\theta$ the behavior of the deviation vector differs as it approaches the singularity at $r = 2m$. Above all, we can witness either stretching or compressing of the deviation vector for various combinations of $q$ and $\theta$. These findings provide insight into the effects of quadrupole deformation on the motion of test particles in the vicinity of the central object.</description>

      <title>Cosmological model with Gong-Zong Parametrization in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the cosmic expansion scenario by using the Gong - Zhang parameter in the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, for a specific form of $f (R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_{m}^{n}$. We get the Hubble parameters in terms of the red-shift $(z)$ obtained using the Gong-Zhang parameter $\omega = \frac{w_o}{z+1}$. Using Bayesian statistical methods based on the $\chi^{2}$-minimization technique, we obtain the median values of this model's model parameters for the cosmic chronometer and Joint (CC+Pantheon) data sets. We deliberate about the behaviour of key cosmological parameters, for instance, the deceleration parameter, and equation of state, energy density $(\rho)$, pressure $(p)$, and the effect of the energy conditions with median values of the model parameters. Additionally, we have examined the behavior of the Statefinder diagnostics and determine the universe's current age of this model.</description>

      <title>Birefringence in fermion-attenuated gravitational wave power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Chern-Simons gravity, a theory that dynamically violates parity, we analyze the power spectrum of gravitational waves in light of the damping effect due to the free streaming relativistic neutrinos and dark fermions. The power spectrum is expressed terms of right- and left-handed polarizations, and the evolution of the gravitational waves is studied numerically. Birefringence is explicitly shown in the power spectrum, though the difference in the amplitudes is small. Specific features of peaks and dips appear gravitational wave power spectrum mirroring chiral gravitational wave mediated parametric resonance during reheating. Our result represents a useful tool to test Chern-Simons gravity and enables to constrain mechanisms of inflation and reheating related to this theory. We predict a falsifiable pattern of observable peaks and dips in the chiral independent gravitational power spectrum, eventually observable in next space-borne gravitational interferometers, including LISA, Taiji and Tianqin.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated LISA parameter estimation with full time domain response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct the first full Bayesian inference analysis for LISA parameter estimation incorporating the effects of subdominant harmonics and spin-precession through a full time domain response. The substantial computational demands of using time domain waveforms for LISA are significantly mitigated by implementing a novel Python version of the IMRPhenomT family of waveform models and the LISA response with GPU acceleration. This time domain response alleviates the theoretical necessity of developing specific transfer functions to approximate the LISA response in the Fourier domain for each specific type of system and allows for the use of unequal arms configurations and realistic LISA orbits. Our analysis includes a series of zero-noise injections for a Massive Black Hole Binary with aligned and precessing spins. We investigate the impact of including subdominant harmonics, compare equal and unequal arm configurations, and analyze different Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI) configurations. We utilize full and uniform priors, with a lower frequency cutoff of 0.1mHz, and a signal duration of approximately two months, sampled every 5 seconds. The sampler is initialized based on Fisher estimates. Our results demonstrate LISA capability to measure the two spin magnitudes and the primary spin tilt angle, alongside sky localization, with percent-level precision, while component masses are determined with sub-percent accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum wormholes at the end of the world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the interesting result that the two asymptotically flat Universes classically linked by the Einstein-Rosen bridge may also be quantum mechanically connected in their far out regions. This would be felt by the Newtonian potential far away from a black/white hole system, and raises the possibility of establishing communication via perturbations. We obtain our results by means of wavepackets with a small variance in the mass, solving the equations derived from a maximally symmetry-reduced canonical quantisation method. Mass and a proxy of the Newtonian potential appear as canonical duals, leading to a Heisenberg uncertainty relation between the two. Coherent states are then built, which become non-semiclassical only in two regions: asymptotic spatial infinity (where unitarity forces the packets to ''feel'' the other asymptotic spatial infinity), and inside the horizon at $r=Gm$ where there is ringing. Whilst the latter has been noted in the literature, the former -- the quantum wormhole -- seems to have eluded past scrutiny. Further studies are required to examine the stability of these conclusions beyond their symmetry-reduced test tube.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the shadow of Johannsen-Psaltis black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis (JP) metric provides a robust framework for testing the no-hair theorem of astrophysical black holes due to the regular spacetime configuration around JP black holes. Verification of this theorem through electromagnetic spectra often involves analyzing the photon sphere near black holes, which is intrinsically linked to black hole shadows. Investigating the shadow of JP black holes offers an effective approach for assessing the validity of theorem. Since the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the JP metric does not permit exact variable separation, an approximate analytical approach is employed to calculate the shadow, while the backward ray-tracing numerical method serves as a rigorous alternative. For JP black holes with closed event horizons, the approximate analytical approach reliably reproduces results obtained through the numerical computation. However, significant discrepancies emerge for black holes with non-closed event horizons. As the deviation parameter $\epsilon_3$ increases, certain regions of the critical curve transition into non-smooth configurations. Analysis of photon trajectories in these regions reveals chaotic dynamics, which accounts for the failure of the approximate analytical method to accurately describe the shadows of JP black holes with non-closed event horizons.</description>

      <title>Does Quantum Gravity Happen at the Planck Scale?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The claim that at the so-called Planck scale our current physics breaks down and a new theory of quantum gravity is required is ubiquitous, but the evidence is shakier than the confidence of those assertions warrants. In this paper, I survey five arguments in favour of this claim - based on dimensional analysis, quantum black holes, generalised uncertainty principles, the nonrenormalisability of quantum gravity, and theories beyond the standard model - but find that none of them succeeds. The argument from nonrenormalisability is the most convincing, yet it requires the unwarranted assumption that the same constant of action occurs in every quantum field theory. Therefore, our theories don't (yet) predict that quantum gravity happens at the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the right-handed neutrino mass from wash-in leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leptogenesis is an attractive scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe that relies on the dynamics of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) in the seesaw extension of the Standard Model. In standard thermal leptogenesis, the RHN mass scale $M_N$ is subject to the Davidson--Ibarra bound, $M_N \gtrsim 10^9\,\textrm{GeV}$, which builds on the assumption that RHN decays are responsible for the violation of both charge-parity invariance ($CP$) and baryon-minus-lepton number ($B\!-\!L$). In this paper, we relax this assumption in the context of the more general framework of wash-in leptogenesis, in which $CP$ violation is encoded in the initial conditions and the only remaining task of the RHN decays is to violate $B\!-\!L$. Solving the relevant set of Boltzmann equations, we find that, in wash-in leptogenesis, the RHN mass scale can be as low as 7 TeV.</description>

      <title>Using the Kaniadakis horizon entropy in the presence of neutrinos to alleviate the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H_{0}$ tension stands as a prominent challenge in cosmology, serving as a primary driver for exploring alternative models of dark energy. Another tension arises from measurements of the $ S_{8} $ parameter, which is characterize the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe. In this study, we address the alleviation of both the Hubble tension and $ S_{8} $ tension by incorporating Kaniadakis horizon entropy. We investigate two scenarios to explore the impact of this entropy on cosmological parameters. In the first scenario, utilizing modified Friedmann equations through Kaniadakis entropy, we estimate the values of $H_{0}$ and $ S_{8} $. In the subsequent scenario, we introduce the neutrino term and assess its effect on mitigating the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ tensions. Our findings reveal that when considering the first scenario, the results closely align with Planck's 2018 outcomes for Hubble and $ S_{8} $ tensions. Moreover, with the inclusion of neutrinos, these tensions are alleviated to approximately 2$\sigma$, and the $ S_{8} $ value is in full agreement with the results from the KiDS and DES survey. Furthermore, we impose a constraint on the parameter $K$ in each scenario. Our analysis yields $K = 0.12\pm 0.41$ for Kaniadakis entropy without neutrinos and $K = 0.39\pm 0.4$ for the combined dataset considering Kaniadakis entropy in the presence of neutrinos. We demonstrate that the value of K may be affected by neutrino mass, which can cause energy transfer between different parts of the universe and alter the Hubble parameter value.</description>

      <title>Role of injection parameters in jet propagation through realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A, remarkable effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models, based on relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution. Notably, these simulations point out that jet injection parameters, such as luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, play a crucial role. However, the impact of these parameters is typically investigated within simplified jet propagation environments, lacking a direct connection with a realistic BNS merger aftermath. In this work, we present the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations exploring the influence of such parameters on the propagation of magnetized incipient GRB jets injected into magnetized environments directly imported from the outcome of a general-relativistic MHD BNS merger simulation. Our results demonstrate that, alongside the injection parameters, the BNS merger environment has a central role in shaping the overall jet evolution. Specifically, under identical jet parameters, the fate of an incipient jet (whether it successfully breaks out or becomes choked) depends strongly on the properties of such environment. Further quantitative comparison between realistic and simplified environments reveals major differences, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the former for accurate modeling.</description>

      <title>Background subtraction method is as applicable as convariant counterterm method, but much simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the criterion for the applicability of the background subtraction method, not only the finiteness condition of the resulting Hamiltonian but also the condition for the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics can be reduced to the form amenable to analysis at infinity. With this, we further show that the background subtraction method is applicable not only to Einstein's gravity, but also to its higher derivative corrections for black holes in both asympotically flat and AdS spacetimes. This thus corrects the everlasting bias that the background subtraction method is rather restrictive compared to the alternative covariant counterterm method since it was proposed around 50 years ago. As a bonus, we also obtain the corresponding expression of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the Euclidean on-shell action. This can be regarded as the first proof of such a relation, which has been assumed to be also valid beyond Einstein's gravity without derivation before.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Hawking Radiation from Near-Extremal Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes have a long AdS$_2$ throat in their near-horizon region. Quantum fluctuations in the throat region are effectively governed by a quantum version of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with matter and are strongly coupled at low temperatures. We investigate how these quantum fluctuations affect the spectrum of emission of particles during Hawking radiation. We systematically consider the cases of Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes for emission of scalar particles and discuss photon and graviton emission from the Kerr background. We find that at very low temperatures the quantum fluctuations radically change the nature of particle emission. Unlike the generic suppression of particle emission in the spherically symmetric Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, we uncover that for particles with non-vanishing angular momentum, the quantum-corrected emission can be substantially enhanced with respect to the standard semiclassical result.</description>

Abstract: The corrections to holographic entanglement entropy from bulk quantum fields in a classical gravitational background are now well understood. They lead, in particular, to unitary Page curves for evaporating black holes. However, the correct treatment of quantum fluctuations of the metric, including graviton excitations, is a longstanding problem. We provide a gauge-invariant prescription for the generalized entropy of gravitons in anti-de Sitter space in terms of areas and bulk entanglement entropy, generalizing the quantum extremal surface prescription to accommodate fluctuations in the semiclassical spacetime geometry. This task requires a careful treatment of the area operator on the graviton Hilbert space and the definition of a "quantum extremal gauge" in which the extremal surface is unperturbed. It also requires us to determine the correct vacuum modular Hamiltonian for the graviton field, which we fix by requiring that it doesn't contain a boundary term in extremal gauge. We check our prescription with an explicit computation of the vacuum-subtracted generalized entropy of states containing a graviton in an AdS-Rindler background. Our results exactly match vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropies for stress-tensor excited states in holographic conformal field theory with $d&gt;2$ dimensions. We also use covariant phase space techniques to give a partial proof of our prescription when the entanglement wedge for the background spacetime has a bifurcate Killing horizon. Along the way, we identify a class of perturbative graviton states that have parametrically larger generalized entropy, in the small $G_N$ expansion, than any low-energy excitations of an ordinary quantum field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper the recent interaction model over post-Newtonian theory of gravity has been used to study the stellar dynamics. It implies space time fabric that built over the massive object gets perturbed or literally contracted in presence of the test body having significant mass. In usual practice of general relativity the effect of interaction is missing or negligible but taking in consideration of this additional interaction the geodesic path followed by the test body must be deviated. From the celestial dynamics we know stellar rotation in the galaxy is not in accordance to Newton gravity and it prompts us to reconcile this interactive modified field for the galactic stars. Here we are to study the galactic stellar kinematics over introducing this additional perturbation. The galactic disk including the central super massive black hole and the star rotating around are being modelled theoretically as an effective two body system. In fact application of this model in the Milky Way shows the galactocentric solar rotational speed 220 km/s and is a good agreement with the observations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Black Holes with R\'enyi Entropy from Classical Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonextensive nature of black holes is one of the most intriguing discoveries. In fact, the black hole entropy is a nonextensive quantity that scales by its surface area at the event horizon. In our work, we extend the thermodynamic phase space of black holes by treating the nonextensive parameter of the R\'enyi entropy as the thermodynamic variable. Using Euler's theorem for a homogeneous function of the black holes' mass, the compatible Smarr formula and the first law of black hole thermodynamics can be obtained. It is also demonstrated that, by keeping the same form of the black hole mass, the R\'enyi temperature is straightforwardly defined as proposed in the literature. Since many different types of black holes can indeed be successfully treated with such a procedure, our consideration is fairly general. It is worthwhile to argue that the black hole thermodynamics in R\'enyi statistics is rooted from the relation among geometric quantities in the same way as the standard approach corresponding to the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. Even though our results are based on classical gravity, they may pave the way to derive the R\'enyi temperature using the notion of quantum field in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Probing internal dissipative processes of neutron stars with gravitational waves during the inspiral of neutron star binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15633v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of out-of-equilibrium, dissipative effects on the dynamics of inspiraling neutron stars. We find that modeling dissipative processes (such as those from the stars internal effective fluid viscosity) requires that one introduce a new tidal deformability parameter--the dissipative tidal deformability--which modifies the phase of gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of a neutron star binary. We show that the dissipative tidal deformability corrects the gravitational-wave phase at 4 post-Newtonian order for quasi-circular binaries. This correction receives a large finite-size enhancement by the stellar compactness, analogous to the case of the tidal deformability. Moreover, the correction is not degenerate with the time of coalescence, which also enters at 4PN order, because it contains a logarithmic frequency-dependent contribution. Using a simple Fisher analysis, we show that physically allowed values for the dissipative tidal deformability may be constrained by measurements of the phase of emitted gravitational waves to roughly the same extent as the (electric-type, quadrupolar) tidal deformability. Finally, we show that there are no out-of-equilibrium, dissipative corrections to the tidal deformability itself. We conclude that there are at least two relevant tidal deformability parameters that can be constrained with gravitational-wave phase measurements during the late inspiral of a neutron star binary: one which characterizes the adiabatic tidal response of the star, and another which characterizes the leading-order out-of-equilibrium, dissipative tidal response. These findings open a window to probe dissipative processes in the interior of neutron stars with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Novel Deep Learning Approach to Detecting Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave detection has opened up new avenues for exploring and understanding some of the fundamental principles of the universe. The optimal method for detecting modelled gravitational-wave events involves template-based matched filtering and performing a multi-detector coincidence search in the resulting signal-to-noise ratio time series. In recent years, advancements in machine learning and deep learning have led to a flurry of research into using these techniques to replace matched filtering searches and for efficient and robust parameter estimation of the gravitational wave sources. This paper presents a feasibility study for a novel approach to detecting binary black hole gravitational wave signals, which utilizes deep learning techniques on the signal-to-noise ratio time series produced from matched filtering. We show that a deep-learning search can efficiently detect binary black hole gravitational waves from the signal-to-noise ratio time series in simulated Gaussian noise with simulated transient glitches. Furthermore, our search method can outperform a maximum SNR-based matched filtering search on simulated data of the Hanford and Livingston LIGO detectors in the presence of glitches. We further demonstrate that our approach can improve the detection sensitivity for binary black hole mergers at lower masses, relative to a baseline sensitivity of existing search pipelines and deep learning approaches. Lastly, since we are building upon the foundations of a matched filtering search pipeline, we can extract estimates for the signal-to-noise ratio and detector frame chirp mass of a gravitational wave event with similar accuracy as existing pipelines.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the dynamical effects of particles orbiting a celestial body in rotating Simpson-Visser (RSV) spacetime. The results show that, compared to Kerr and rotating regular black holes, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of an RSV wormhole is closer to the central object. Using high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data from microquasars and $\chi^2$ analysis, we constrain the spin of microquasars and the regularization parameter $l$ in RSV spacetime based on four HFQPO models and their variants, and evaluate the models using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayes factor. Calculations indicate that $\mathrm{ER}_0$, $\mathrm{ER}_1$, $\mathrm{ER}_2$, $\mathrm{RP}_0$, $\mathrm{RP}_2$, and $\mathrm{WD}$ models have the same support by observational data as the best model $\mathrm{TD}$. Other models considered in this paper have less or no support from observational data. Concretely, for cases of $\mathrm{ER}_0$ and $\mathrm{RP}_0$ models, the observational constraints on RSV regularization parameter are respectively: $l^* = 0.908_{-0.073}^{+0.086}$ and $l^* &lt;0.314$ at $68 \%$ confidence level, which correspond to the regular or the Kerr ($l^*=0$) BH. For $\mathrm{ER}_1$, $\mathrm{ER}_2$, $\mathrm{RP}_2$, $\mathrm{TD}$, and $\mathrm{WD}$ models, the observational data suggest that RSV objects should be the traversable wormhole, e.g. we have the limits: $l^* =1.850 \pm 0.036$, $l^* =4.964 \pm 0.046$, etc.</description>

Abstract: Simplicial approaches to quantum gravity such as Quantum Regge Calculus and Spin Foams include configurations where bulk edges can become arbitrarily large while keeping the lengths of the boundary edges small. Such configurations pose significant challenges in Euclidean Quantum Regge Calculus, as they lead to infinities for the partition function and length expectation values. Here we investigate such configurations in three-dimensional Lorentzian Quantum Regge Calculus, and find that the partition function and length expectation values remain finite. This shows that the Lorentzian approach can avoid a key issue of the Euclidean approach. We also find that the space of configurations, for which bulk edges can become very large, is much richer than in the Euclidean case. In particular, it includes configurations with irregular light-cone structures, which lead to imaginary terms in the Regge action and branch cuts along the Lorentzian path integral contour. Hence, to meaningfully define the Lorentzian Regge path integral, one needs to clarify how such configurations should be handled.</description>

Abstract: Theories formulated in the arena of teleparallel geometries are generically plagued by ghost-like instabilities or other pathologies that are ultimately caused by the breaking of some symmetries. In this work, we construct a class of ghost-free theories based on a symmetry under Transverse Diffeomorphisms that is naturally realised in symmetric teleparallelism. We explicitly show their equivalence to a family of theories with an extra scalar field plus a global degree of freedom and how Horndeski theories and healthy couplings to matter fields can be readily accommodated.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave memory is said to arise when a gravitational wave burst produces changes in a physical system that persist even after that wave has passed. This paper analyzes gravitational wave bursts in plane wave spacetimes, deriving memory effects for timelike and null geodesics, massless scalar fields, and massless spinning particles whose motion is described by the spin Hall equations. We find that all such effects are characterized by four "memory tensors," three of which are independent. We also show that memory effects for null geodesics can have strong longitudinal components, even in vacuum general relativity. When considering massless particles with spin, we solve the spin Hall equations analytically by showing that there exists a conservation law associated with each conformal Killing vector. For the scattering of fields by gravitational waves, we show that given any solution to the massless scalar field equation in flat spacetime, a weak-field solution in a plane wave spacetime can be generated just by applying an appropriate differential operator -- an operator that is constructed from the aforementioned memory tensors. Memory effects for scalar fields are illustrated for both incoming plane waves and higher-order Gaussian beams. We also present a numerical comparison between the spin Hall equations and the full evolution of localized wave packets with angular momentum. Although we work in plane wave spacetimes, which are physically idealized, similar results are also expected to apply for sufficiently small systems affected by distantly generated gravitational waves. Using the Penrose limit, our results may also apply to ultrarelativistic systems at arbitrary locations in arbitrary (even nonradiating) spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Dissipative tidal interactions can be used to probe the out-of-equilibrium physics of neutron stars using gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we present the first post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the orbital dynamics of a binary system containing objects whose tidal interactions have a dissipative contribution. We derive the 1PN-accurate equations of motion in the center-of-mass frame and a generalized energy-balance law that is valid for dissipative tidal interactions. We show how mass and energy loss due to the absorption of orbital energy change the orbital dynamics and derive the next-to-leading order correction to the gravitational wave phase of a binary system in a quasi-circular orbit containing initially non-spinning components. We then use this waveform model to constrain, for the first time, the individual dissipative tidal deformabilities of each of the binary components that generated the GW170817 event using real data. We find that the GW170817 data requires $\Xi_{1} \lesssim 1121$ and $\Xi_{2} \lesssim 1692$ at 90\% confidence, where $\Xi_{1,2}$ are the individual tidal deformabilities of the primary and secondary binary components that produced the GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Physical reinterpretation of heat capacity discontinuities for static black holes</title>

Abstract: A generic characteristic of self-gravitating systems is that they have a negative heat capacity. An important example of this behavior is given by the Schwarzschild black hole. The case of charged and rotating black holes is even more interesting since a change of sign of the specific heat takes place through an infinite discontinuity. This has been usually associated with a black hole thermodynamic phase transition appearing at the points where the heat capacity diverges, the so-called Davies points. This aspect of black hole thermodynamics has been addressed from different perspectives, motivating different interpretations since its discovery in the 1970s. In this paper, a physical reinterpretation of the heat capacity is provided for spherically symmetric and static black holes. Our analysis is partially based on a reformulation of the black hole heat capacity using the Newman-Penrose formalism. The application to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole case reveals a clear physical interpretation of the Newman-Penrose scalars evaluated at the event horizon. This allows us to write the heat capacity as a balance of pressures defined at the horizon, in particular, a matter pressure (coming from the energy-momentum tensor) and a thermal pressure (coming from the holographic energy equipartition of the horizon). The Davies point is identified with the point where the Komar thermal energy density matches the matter pressure at the horizon. We also compare the black hole case with the case of self-gravitating objects and their corresponding thermal evolutions. We conclude that the heat capacity of black holes and self-gravitating systems can be understood qualitatively in similar terms.</description>

      <title>Poincare gauge gravity from nonmetric gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general linear gauge theory, with independent solder form and connection. These spaces have both torsion and nonmetricity. We show that the Cartan structure equations together with the defining equation for nonmetricity allow the mixed symmetry components of nonmetricity to be absorbed into an altered torsion tensor. Field redefinitions reduce the structure equations to those of Poincare gauge theory, with local Lorentz symmetry and metric compatibility. In order to allow recovery the original torsion and nonmetric fields, we replace the definition of nonmetricity by an additional structure equation and demand integrability of the extended system. We show that the maximal Lie algebra compatible with the enlarged set is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra. From this Lorentzian conformal geometry, we establish that the difference between the field strength of special conformal transformations and the torsion and is given by the mixed symmetry nonmetricity of an equivalent asymmetric system.</description>

      <title>Phase time and Ehrenfest's theorem in relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of phase time, which has been previously proposed as a solution to the problem of time in quantum gravity. Concretely, we show how the geometry of configuration space together with the phase of the wave function of the universe can, under certain conditions, lead to the definition of a positive-definite squared norm from which probabilities can be defined. The norm is conserved under time evolution, and we obtain a version of Ehrenfest's theorem that is analogous to the one in ordinary quantum mechanics. We address how the present approach avoids some difficulties that were encountered in previous attempts at defining an Ehrenfest theorem relative to phase time in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity, and how it is connected to a notion of gauge fixing the inner product. We conclude with a brief outlook.</description>

      <title>Stable $f(Q)$ gravity model through non-trivial connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study effectively reconstructs a cosmological model utilizing covariant $f(Q)$ gravity within Connection-III and FLRW spacetime. The dynamic behavior of the reconstructed model is thoroughly analyzed using the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and various observational datasets. Our robust findings demonstrate that the model displays quintessence behavior at the present epoch and converges to the $\Lambda$CDM model at late time. It is confirmed through comprehensive evaluations against energy conditions that the Null Energy Condition remains positive throughout cosmic evolution, and the Dominant Energy Condition is consistently satisfied. The Strong Energy Condition is initially fulfilled in the early Universe but violated in the late epoch. Moreover, scalar perturbations extensively assess stability, affirming the strength of the model with respect to the Hubble parameter. This research offers compelling insights into cosmic acceleration, suggesting that $f(Q)$ gravity can effectively displace the $\Lambda$CDM model and provides a convincing alternative explanation for the current accelerating expansion of the Universe without relying on the cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a way to detect gravitons by replicating the Brownian motion experiment. The number $N_g$ of gravitons can be large enough for the stochastic gravitational noise produced by them to displace a massive test particle in a physical system, allowing for the detection of gravitons. Possible experiments to detect gravitons are proposed involving collective stochastic fluctuations due to a large number of gravitons, causing a Brownian motion displacement of a massive test body. Gravitational wave experiments involving advanced interferometer techniques and mirrors could detect the large collective number of gravitons, and could detect Brownian motion of test particles in the detectors' component mirrors. The problem of reducing thermal and other background noise is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cotton gravity was recently introduced as a higher derivative extension of General Relativity. The field equations of the theory involve the rank-3 Cotton tensor. Here we show that all solutions of the theory, including the black holes, have vanishing conserved charges, i.e. mass and angular momentum. This result implies that either the theory is unphysical since all the black holes carry the charges of the vacuum and can be created at no energy cost, or the theory has confinement of mass/energy and all other conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Geometrical-optics analysis of the interaction between light and gravitational waves from binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a situation in which light emitted from the neighborhood of a binary interacts with gravitational waves from the binary (e.g., a supermassive black hole binary in a quasar, a binary pulsar, etc.). The effect is cumulative over the long path lengths of light propagation and might be appreciable if the interaction initially takes place close to the source of gravitational waves, where the strain amplitude can be large. This situation can be modeled effectively using spherical gravitational waves (i.e., transverse-traceless radially propagating waves), with the strain amplitude varying with the distance from the source to a field point where the two wavefronts of light and gravitational waves meet each other. Our analysis employs geometrical-optics methods in curved spacetime, where the curvature is due to gravitational waves propagating in a flat spacetime background. We place a particular focus on the effect of gravitational Faraday rotation (or Skrotskii/Rytov effect) resulting from the interaction between light and gravitational waves from binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet (EGB) gravity models, the slow-roll approximation has been extended by taking into account the first-order slow-roll parameter $\delta_1 =-2\,H^2\,\xi^\prime/U_0$, which is proportional to the first derivative of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi$ with respect to the e-folding number. These extensions lead to the question of the accuracy of effective potential reconstruction during the generalization of attractors in EGB gravity. We have reconstructed models using the extended slow-roll approximations and compared them with the exact expressions and the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

Abstract: We analyse linearised field equations around the Minkowski metric with its standard flat parallel transport in models of Newer GR, that is quadratic actions in terms of nonmetricity tensor. We show that half of the freedom in choosing the model parameters is immediately fixed by asking for reasonable properties of tensors and vectors, defined with respect to spatial rotations, and accurately describe the much more complicated sector of scalars. In particular, we show that, from the teleparallel viewpoint, the model of STEGR with addition of a gradient squared of the metric determinant exhibits three halves new dynamical modes, and not just one like it was previously claimed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbiting LISA instrument is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz band, produced by sources including galactic binaries and extreme mass ratio inspirals, among others. The detector consists of three spacecraft, each carrying a pair of free-falling test masses. A technology-demonstration mission, LISA Pathfinder, was launched in 2015, and observed several sudden changes in test mass acceleration, referred to as "glitches." Similar glitches in the full LISA mission have the potential to contaminate the Time-Delay Interferometry outputs that are the detector's primary data product. In this paper, we describe an optimization technique using maximum likelihood estimation for detecting and removing glitches with a known waveform.</description>

Abstract: A new approach is presented to compute entropy for massless scalar quantum fields. By perturbing a skewed correlation matrix composed of field operator correlation functions, the mutual information is obtained for disjoint spherical regions of size $r$ at separation $R$, including an expansion to all orders in $r/R$. This approach also permits a perturbative expansion for the thermal field entropy difference in the small temperature limit ($T \ll 1/r$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of noncommutative (NC) deformation of gauge field theory by the angular twist, we first rederive the NC scalar and gauge field model from our previous papers and then generalize it to the second order in the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map. It turns out that SW expansion is finite and that it ceases at the second order in the deformation parameter, ultimately giving rise to the equation of motion for the scalar field in Reissner--Nordstr\"om (RN) metric that is nonperturbative and exact at the same order. As a further step, we show that the effective metric put forth and constructed in our previous work satisfies the equations of Einstein-Maxwell gravity, but only within the first order of deformation and when the gauge field is fixed by the Coulomb potential of the charged black hole. Thus obtained NC deformation of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om (RN) metric appears to have an additional off-diagonal element which scales linearly with a deformation parameter. We analyze various properties of this metric.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dark siren cosmology systematics from galaxy weighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of GW170817 and the measurement of its redshift from the associated electromagnetic counterpart provided the first gravitational wave determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), demonstrating the potential power of standard-siren cosmology. In contrast to this bright siren approach, the dark siren approach can be utilized for gravitational-wave sources in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart: one considers all galaxies contained within the localization volume as potential hosts. When statistically averaging over the potential host galaxies, weighting them by physically-motivated properties (e.g., tracing star formation or stellar mass) could improve convergence. Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the impact of these weightings on the measurement of $H_0$. We find that incorrect weighting schemes can lead to significant biases due to two effects: the assumption of an incorrect galaxy redshift distribution, and preferentially weighting incorrect host galaxies during the inference. The magnitudes of these biases are influenced by the number of galaxies along each line of sight, the measurement uncertainty in the gravitational-wave luminosity distance, and correlations in the parameter space of galaxies. We show that the bias may be overcome from improved localization constraints in future GW detectors, a strategic choice of priors or weighting prescription, and by restricting the analysis to a subset of high-SNR events. We propose the use of hierarchical inference as a diagnostic of incorrectly-weighted prescriptions. Such approaches can simultaneously infer the correct weighting scheme and the values of the cosmological parameters, thereby mitigating the bias in dark siren cosmology due to incorrect host-galaxy weighting.</description>

      <title>A non-local way around the no-global-symmetries conjecture in quantum gravity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The no-global-symmetries conjecture is central to the swampland program that delineates the boundary between effective field theories that can be obtained from a quantum theory of gravity to those that cannot. The conjecture states that virtual black-hole configurations in the path integral generate terms that violate all global symmetries in the effective action for matter. Because of its central role, it is crucial to understand limitations to the validity of this conjecture. In the context of the Lorentzian path integral over spacetime geometries, we explore whether virtual black-hole configurations can be suppressed dynamically. To that end, we work in a spherically symmetric setting and make use of horizon-detecting curvature invariants which vanish on the horizon. By constructing a non-local gravitational action from the inverse of such curvature invariants, we can achieve destructive interference of black-hole configurations in the path integral. Given that non-local gravitational actions appear generically as the result of integrating out matter degrees of freedom from a theory for quantum gravity and matter, our exemplary construction reinforces discussions about the role of non-locality in assessing arguably universal properties of quantum gravity within the framework of path integrals.</description>

Abstract: Numerous non-standard interactions between neutrinos and scalar fields have been suggested in the literature. In this work, we have outlined the case of tensorial neutrino non-standard interactions with scalar fields, which can be related to the effective CPT-even dimension-4 operators of the Standard Model Extension (SME). Moreover, in this paper, we have mostly analyzed the projected sensitivities to the CPT-even isotropic $c_{\alpha \beta}$ and $Z-$spatial $c_{\alpha \beta}^{ZZ}$ SME coefficients, in the context of a long-baseline experimental configuration. We study the particular case of DUNE and show its sensitivity to this type of new physics. The current IceCube experiment and upcoming neutrino experiments such as KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen2, and GRAND proposals may clarify these classes of neutrino non-standard interactions.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational interaction, as described by the Einstein-Cartan theory, is shown to emerge as the by-product of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge symmetry in a pre-geometric four-dimensional spacetime. Starting from a formulation \`a la Yang-Mills on an SO(1,4) or SO(3,2) principal bundle and not accounting for a spacetime metric, the Einstein-Hilbert action is recovered after the identification of the effective spacetime metric and spin connection for the residual SO(1,3) gauge symmetry of the spontaneously broken phase - i.e. the stabiliser of the SO(1,4) or SO(3,2) gauge group. Thus, the two fundamental tenets of General Relativity, i.e. diffeomorphism invariance and the equivalence principle, can arise from a more fundamental gauge principle. The two mass parameters that characterise Einstein gravity, namely the Planck mass and the cosmological constant, are likewise shown to be emergent, with the correct sign for the cosmological constant depending on whether the fundamental gauge group is taken to be either the de Sitter or the anti-de Sitter group. The phase transition from the unbroken to the spontaneously broken phase is expected to happen close to the Planck temperature. This is conjectured to be dynamically driven by a scalar field that implements a Higgs mechanism, hence providing mass to new particles, with consequences for cosmology and high-energy physics. The couplings of gravity to matter are discussed after drawing up a dictionary that interconnects pre-geometric and effective geometric quantities. In the unbroken phase where the fundamental gauge symmetry is restored, the theory is potentially power-counting renormalisable without matter, offering a novel path towards a UV completion of Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona</title>

Abstract: Using two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power of the black hole. The sheath is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains. About 20% of the sheath power is dissipated between 2 and 10 gravitational radii. The plasma in the dissipative sheath moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with trans-relativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is $\sim1.2\pm0.5$. In the frame moving with the mean (radially-dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an `effective bulk temperature' of $\sim$100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath $\sim 0.01-0.1$, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable `coronal' region, capable of upscattering seed soft photons into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>
