      <title>Parameterized Deceleration in $f(Q,C)$ gravity: A logarithmic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a distinctive logarithmic parameterization of the deceleration parameter within the $f(Q, C)$ gravity framework, incorporating a nonlinear functional form $f(Q, C) = \gamma_1 Q^n + \gamma_2 C$, where $Q$ and $C$ denote the nonmetricity scalar and boundary term, respectively, and $n \geq 1$. This approach provides a unique perspective on the universe's accelerated expansion without resorting to exotic fields. Using observational data from Hubble measurements (OHD) and the Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernovae dataset, the model parameters were constrained through a $\chi^2$ minimization technique. The analysis reveals a transition from deceleration to acceleration in the universe's expansion history, with the transition redshifts $z_t \approx 0.98$ (OHD) and $z_t \approx 0.76$ (Pantheon+SH0ES). The model demonstrates consistency with observations, offering insights into the dynamics of dark energy and alternative gravity theories, while effectively modeling cosmic evolution across epochs.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics in Flat and Curved Spacetime: Covariance, Linear Waves, and Bjorken Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore various aspects of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics, where hydrodynamic currents are derived from an expansion in the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, incorporating both flat and curved spacetimes. After establishing covariant definitions for angular momentum currents, we demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor requires modifications involving the Riemann curvature and the spin tensors. We also revise pseudo-gauge transformations to ensure their applicability in curved spacetimes. Key assumptions for semi-classical spin hydrodynamics are introduced, enabling studies without explicitly invoking quantum kinetic theory. We derive and analyze the linearized semi-classical spin hydrodynamic equations, proving that spin and fluid modes decouple in the linear regime. As a concrete example, we study the ideal-spin approximation in a dissipative fluid with shear viscosity. This analysis confirms our general result: the damping of spin waves is governed solely by spin relaxation time coefficients, independent of linear fluid perturbations. We also examine the Gibbs stability criterion and reveal its limitations at first order in $\hbar$, signaling the inherent anisotropy of the equilibrium state, which remains unaddressed in current semi-classical spin hydrodynamics formulations. Finally, within a conformal Bjorken flow background and using the slow-roll approximation attractor for the fluid sector, we show that the relaxation of the spin potential is governed by spin relaxation time coefficients, mirroring the damping behavior of spin waves in the linear regime.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network-Based Search for Unmodeled Transients in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's Third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a Neural Network (NN)-based search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the third observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. The search targets unmodeled transients with durations of milliseconds to a few seconds in the 30-1500 Hz frequency band, without assumptions about the incoming signal direction, polarization, or morphology. Using the Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge (GWAK) method, three compact binary coalescences (CBCs) identified by existing pipelines are successfully detected, along with a range of detector glitches. The algorithm constructs a low-dimensional embedded space to capture the physical features of signals, enabling the detection of CBCs, detector glitches, and unmodeled transients. This study demonstrates GWAK's ability to enhance gravitational-wave searches beyond the limits of existing pipelines, laying the groundwork for future detection strategies.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and shadow of Schwarzschild black holes embedded in a Dehnen type dark matter halo exhibiting string cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a static spherically symmetric black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-(1,4,0) type dark matter (DM) halo in the presence of a cloud string. We examine and present data on how the core density of the DM halo parameter and the cloud string parameter affect BH attributes such as quasinormal modes (QNMs) and shadow cast. To do this, we first look into the effective potential of perturbation equations for three types of perturbation fields with different spins: massless scalar field, electromagnetic field, and gravitational field. Then, using the 6th order WKB approximation, we examine quasinormal modes of the BH disturbed by the three fields and derive quasinormal frequencies. The changes of QNM versus the core density parameter and the cloud string parameter for three disturbances are explored. We also investigate how the core density and the cloud string parameters affect the photon sphere and shadow radius. Interestingly, the study shows that the influence of Dehnen type DM and cloud string increases both photon spheres and shadow radius. Finally, we employ observational data from Sgr $A{^\star}$ and $M87{^\star}$ to set limitations on the BH parameters.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov radiation as ghost instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Cherenkov radiation can be interpreted as ghost instability of a certain type. Solutions of modified gravity theories often contain ghost instabilities. One type of such ghost instability is associated with existence of different types of species with causal cones that do not share common time, which leads to vacuum decay via creation of particles with positive and negative energies. We show that this ghost instability can be seen as Cherenkov radiation and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Employing shadow radius to constrain extra dimensions in black string space-time with dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the shadow of five-dimensional black strings immersed in dark matter environment. We show the influence of the momentum characteristic parameter $\widetilde{P_{y}}$ of the extra compact dimension on the shadow radius, and we provide the constraint range $0~\leq~\widetilde{P_{y}}~\lesssim~0.171215$ in the static Schwarzschild black string solution based on the observed data. Furthermore, we give the effective range $2.16138~\text{mm}~\lesssim~\ell~&lt;~2.6~\text{mm}$ for the extra length $\ell$ and $\mathrm{k}~\lesssim~0.07398$ for the compactness parameter $\mathrm{k}$ in the environment near a black hole. We also find that the momentum characteristic parameter $\widetilde{P_{y}}$ of extra dimension will affect the effective range of dark matter related parameters when using shadow radius as a constraint tool.</description>

      <title>Kinetic coupled tachyon: A dynamical system analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and examine a kinetically coupled tachyon dark energy model, where a tachyon scalar field interacts with the matter sector. More specifically, we deduce this cosmological setting from a generalised interacting dark energy model that allows for the kinetic term of the scalar field to couple to the matter species a priori in the action. A thorough dynamical system analysis and its cosmological implications unveil the appearance of a scaling solution which is also an attractor of the system, thanks to a novel critical point, with a period of accelerated expansion thereafter. This new solution, not present in the uncoupled case, has the enticing consequence of alleviating the coincidence problem.</description>

      <title>A canonical foliation on null infinity in perturbations of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr stability for small angular momentum has been proved in the series of works by Klainerman-Szeftel, Giorgi-Klainerman-Szeftel and Shen. Some of the most basic conclusions of the result, concerning various physical quantities on the future null infinity are derived in the work of Klainerman-Szeftel. Further important conclusions were later derived in An-He-Shen and Chen-Klainerman. In this paper, based on the existence and uniqueness results for GCM spheres by Klainerman-Szeftel, we establish the existence of a canonical foliation on the future null infinity for which the null energy, linear momentum, center of mass and angular momentum are well defined and satisfy the expected physical laws of gravitational radiation. The rigid character of this foliation eliminates the usual ambiguities related to these quantities in the physics literature. We also show that under the initial assumption of Klainerman-Szeftel, the center of mass of the black hole has a large deformation (recoil) after the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Calculation of LIGO-like Compton Scattering and Experiment Proposal for Graviton Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the lack of a universally accepted quantum gravity theory, gravitons are considered the quantum noise in gravitational waves. Wave mediation requires that gravitons be in a coherence state, with an abundance number of order $\sim10^{79}$. Thus, the detection of coherent-state gravitons may be possible in a LIGO-like experiment via Compton scattering with a nanospherical test mass. This work presents the associating scattering amplitude calculation using effective field theory, calculating a total cross section approximately $100 ~\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a coherence state and $\sim10^{-81}~\mathrm{m^2}$ for a single graviton. An experiment proposal involving levitation techniques of a nanosphere is given in full description.</description>

      <title>Understanding curvature-matter interaction in viable $f(R)$ dark energy models: A dynamical analysis approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a linear stability analysis approach to explore the dynamics of matter and curvature-driven dark energy interactions within the framework of two types of viable $f(R)$ gravity models. The interaction is modeled via a source term in the continuity equations, $\mathcal{Q} = \alpha \tilde{\rho}_{\rm m} \Big{(}\frac{3H^3}{\kappa^2 \rho_{\rm curv}} + \frac{\kappa^2 }{3H}\rho_{\rm curv} \Big{)}$. Our results reveal significant modifications to the fixed points and their stability criteria compared to traditional $f(R)$ gravity analyses without matter-curvature coupling. We identify constraints on model and coupling parameters necessary for critical point stability, illustrating how the interaction influences cosmic dynamics within specific parameter ranges. The findings are consistent with observed cosmic evolution, supporting stable late-time acceleration. Moreover, we highlight the coupling parameter's potential role in addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.</description>

      <title>Computing the graph-changing dynamics of loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In loop quantum gravity (LQG), quantum states of the gravitational field are represented by labelled graphs called spinnetworks. Their dynamics can be described by a Hamiltonian constraint, which modifies the spinnetwork graphs. Fixed graph approximations of the dynamics have been extensively studied, but its full graph-changing action so far remains elusive. The latter, alongside the solutions of its constraint, are arguably the missing features to access physically correct quantum-relativistic phenomenology from canonical LQG. Here, we introduce the first numerical tool that implements graph-changing dynamics via the Hamiltonian constraint. We find new solutions to this constraint and show that some quantum-geometrical observables behave differently than in the graph-preserving truncation. This work aims at fostering a new era of numerical simulations in canonical LQG that, crucially, embrace the graph-changing aspects of its dynamics, laying aside debated approximations.</description>

      <title>Taming Thiemann's Hamiltonian constraint in canonical loop quantum gravity: reversibility, eigenstates and graph-change analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian constraint remains an elusive object in loop quantum gravity because its action on spinnetworks leads to changes in their corresponding graphs. As a result, calculations in loop quantum gravity are often considered unpractical, and neither the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian constraint, which form the physical space of states, nor the concrete effect of its graph-changing character on observables are entirely known. Much worse, there is no reference value to judge whether the commonly adopted graph-preserving approximations lead to results anywhere close to the non-approximated dynamics. Our work sheds light on many of these issues, by devising a new numerical tool that allows us to implement the action of the Hamiltonian constraint without the need for approximations and to calculate expectation values for geometric observables. To achieve that, we fill the theoretical gap left in the derivations of the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on spinnetworks: we provide the first complete derivation of such action for the case of 4-valent spinnetworks, while updating the corresponding derivation for 3-valent spinnetworks. Our derivations also include the action of the volume operator. By proposing a new approach to encode spinnetworks into functions of lists and the derived formulas into functionals, we implement both the Hamiltonian constraint and the volume operator numerically. We are able to transform spinnetworks with graph-changing dynamics perturbatively and verify that volume expectation values have rather different behavior from the approximated, graph-preserving results. Furthermore, using our tool we find a family of potentially relevant solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint. Our work paves the way to a new generation of calculations in loop quantum gravity, in which graph-changing results and their phenomenology can finally be accounted for and understood.</description>

      <title>Compact Objects in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Theory and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of General Relativity, black holes are not allowed to possess scalar hair, wormholes are not traversable and particle-like solutions are irregular. Therefore, in order to derive novel and physically interesting solutions that describe compact objects one needs to address generalised gravitational theories. One popular class of such theories is the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory with a general coupling function between the scalar field of the theory and the quadratic Gauss-Bonnet term. Starting from black holes, we present a variety of spherically-symmetric solutions for several different forms of the coupling function and discuss their main features. We then proceed to wormhole solutions and demonstrate that the EsGB theory naturally supports traversable wormholes without the need for exotic matter. Regular scalarised particle-like solutions also emerge in the context of the same theory which also possess interesting observable features such as photon rings and echoes. Moving beyond this class of theories, we then address the more extended scalar-tensor Horndeski theory, briefly mention the types of black-hole solutions that arise, and demonstrate that an appropriately constructed disformal transformation of a black-hole solution, such as the Lu-Pang solution, results into a traversable wormhole in the context of the beyond-Horndeski theory.</description>

We derived the Hamilton-Jacobi equation used in the article from the Lagrangian utilized and found inconsistencies in the use of the interaction term which describes the magnetic dipole moment of the particle. Consequently, this results in incorrect equations of motion for the particle.</description>

      <title>Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity and Lorentzian Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We directly evaluate the probability amplitudes in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity using the Lorentzian path integral formulation. By imposing boundary conditions on the scale factor and the dilaton field, the Lorentzian path integral uniquely yields the probability amplitude without contradiction. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions, we demonstrate that the amplitude derived from the Lorentzian path integral is expressed in terms of the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Furthermore, we provide the determinant for various boundary conditions and perform a detailed analysis of the Lefschetz thimble structure and saddle points. In contrast to four-dimensional gravity, we show that the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal is approximately valid in JT quantum cosmology. Furthermore, addressing quantum perturbation issues, we show that the quantum genesis of the two-dimensional universe occurs and exhibits perturbative regularity when the dilaton field is non-zero and large as an initial condition.</description>

      <title>Observational appearances of an inner extremal regular black hole illuminated by various accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the observational appearances of an inner extremal regular black hole(IERBH) illuminated by various types of accretion models. The study reveals that when the BH is illuminated by specific accretion flows, the effects of quantum gravity become more pronounced,significantly impacting key observational features such as the shadow radius, photon ring, and total observed intensity. Specifically, the introduction of a more realistic radially infalling spherical accretion flow further accentuates these differences. This dynamic flow results in a darker central region in the BH image due to the Doppler effect, which modulates the observed intensity based on the relative motion of the infalling matter. The shadow radius and total observed intensity are notably affected by the quantum correction parameters, providing additional signatures that distinguish regular BHs from their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a d-dimensional regular black hole featuring an integrable singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we exhaustively investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a probe scalar field over a d-dimensional regular black hole (BH) characterized by the parameter A. The quasinormal frequencies (QNFs) exhibit different behaviors with respect to the parameter A for d = 4 and d &gt; 4. Firstly, the trends of QNFs with respect to A exhibit completely opposite patterns for the case of d = 4 and d &gt; 4. Secondly, in the 4-dimensional regular BH, a non-monotonic behavior with respect to A is observed in the imaginary part of the fundamental modes with vanishing angular quantum number. In contrast, this non-monotonic behavior only appears in the overtones when d &gt; 4. Thirdly, an overtone outburst accompanied by an oscillatory patter is observed only in the case of d &gt; 4, but not in d = 4.</description>

      <title>Gravity induced entanglement of multiple massive particles with large spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation rate of the quantum entanglement in a system composed of multiple massive particles with large spin, where the mass of a single particle can be split into multiple trajectories by a generalized Stern-Gerlach interferometer. Taking the coherent spin states (CSS) as the initial state and considering the gravitational interaction due to Newtonian potential, we compute the generation rate of the entanglement for different configurations of the setup. Explicitly, the optimal polar angles of the spin are found numerically for systems with three and four particles, respectively. We conclude that the amount of the entanglement increases with the number of particles as well as the spin, and the configuration of the prism with a particle at the center generates the best rate of the entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss fermion tunneling from the black hole exterior to white hole exterior geometry using the spin foam technique in background-independent Loop Quantum Gravity. The fermion transition time is equal, longer, or shorter than the black hole tunneling time, depending on the Euclidean dihedral angle. For a locally pinched negative curvature, fermions accumulate in the black hole exterior region where the black hole has already emerged from the white hole. Conversely, in locally stretched positive curvature, fermions reach the white hole exterior prior to the black hole, indicating an Einstein-Rosen bridge-like geometry in black hole-to-white hole bounce.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Energy Creation in the Sandwich pp-Waves Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the spacetime of two colliding sandwich gravitational waves, focusing on evaluating gravitational energy before and after the collision. In the framework of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), we derive a true energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational waves and integrate it over a finite region of space, obtaining analytical expressions for the energy of each wave and the resulting spacetime. Our findings reveal that the energy after the collision exceeds the pre-collision, indicating energy creation. We analyze the energy density and ``surface energy density" on the wavefronts, underscoring their divergence near the singularity. Additionally, we observe that the colliding waves drag observers but exert no acceleration at the collision event. This study addresses and resolves longstanding issues raised by Szekeres in his seminal work on colliding pp-waves, offering a more physically realistic framework through the local energy definition provided by TEGR. The implications for gravitational wave interactions and their energy transfer mechanisms are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton equations in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity and in New General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Hamiltonian function for extended teleparallel theories of gravity in their covariant formulation. In particular, we present the Hamiltonian for $f(T)$ gravity and New General Relativity. From this, we obtain the related Hamilton equations, which are presented both in covariant formulation and Weitzenb\"ock gauge. In this framework, teleparallel equivalent to General Relativity, its $f(T)$ extension and New General Relativity can be compared. We find that $f(T)$ and New General Relativity consistently reduce to the Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity, while significant differences appear comparing the Hamilton equations of $f(T)$ with $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>The Advantage of Early Detection and Localization from Eccentricity-Induced Higher Harmonic Modes in Second-Generation Ground-Based Detector Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection and localization of gravitational waves (GWs) are crucial for identifying and capturing their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, playing a significant role in multi-messenger astronomy. For second-generation (2G) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, the typical duration of GW signals ranges from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ seconds to several tens of seconds due to their optimal sensitivities only at higher frequencies. This limited duration is insufficient to provide adequate early warning and localization for potential GWs and their associated EM counterparts. In this paper, we investigate whether eccentricity-induced higher harmonic modes, which enter the detector band much earlier than the dominant mode, can aid early detection and localization of GW sources using the 2G ground-based detector network. We select two typical events, a GW170817-like BNS and a GW150914-like BBH, as illustrative examples. For a GW170817-like BNS, we find that the eccentric case with $e_0=0.4$ at 10 Hz can achieve an SNR of 4 and the threshold SNR of 8 approximately 12 minutes and 5 minutes before merger, representing 4.5- and 1.5-minute improvements in time-to-merger compared to the circular case, respectively. Additionally, with $e_0=0.4$, it can achieve a localization of $1000 \, (100)\, \rm deg^2$ at 5 (1) minutes before the merger, reflecting improvements of 2 minutes (15 seconds) compared to the circular case. For a typical GW150914-like BBH, due to the much shorter signal duration, the time-to-merger gained from higher modes for achieving the same SNR and localization is limited to $\mathcal{O}(0.1)-\mathcal{O}(1)$ seconds. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of eccentricity-induced higher harmonic modes in improving early warning and localization of GW and EM counterparts, particularly for BNS systems.</description>

      <title>The second order quasi-normal modes for an AdS$_4$ black brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the second order gravitational perturbations in an AdS black brane background. The equations of motion for the second order modes are obtained in terms of gauge invariant variables, where in general the second order quasi-normal modes are sourced by two first order quasi-normal modes. The ratio of the amplitudes between the second order mode and the product of two linear modes in the source is numerically computed. Remarkably, it turns out that the quadratic-to-linear ratio of amplitudes at horizon is found to be of order one in general. In particular, the resonance occurs at special positions in momentum space, where the amplitude becomes divergent. The condition leading to the resonance is that the combined frequency of two sources coincides with one of another first order quasi-normal mode. This phenomenon is in contrast to what is observed in asymptotically flat spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric teleparallel gravity (STG) can be regarded as a modified gravity theory that lacks diffeomorphism symmetries, which complicates the calculation of its degrees of freedom. In this study, we analyze the linear perturbations of general STG models on a Minkowski background, considering both scenarios with and without scalar couplings. Furthermore, we provide lower bounds for the number of degrees of freedom associated with each model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing and Image Distortion by Buchdahl Inspired Metric in $\mathcal{R}^2$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing by \textit{special} Buchdahl inspired metric with the Buchdahl parameter $\tilde{k}$. In strong deflection limit, we derive the deflection angle analytically for the light rays that diverge as photons approach the photon sphere. These are then used in order to compute the angular image positions modeling supermassive black holes, Sgr A* and M87* as lenses. The Einstein rings for the outermost relativistic images are also depicted here alongside observational constraints on $\tilde{k}$ by the Einstein radius and lens mass. Constraints on $\tilde{k}$ are obtained modelling black holes ( Sgr A* and M87*) and Canarias Einstein ring. In weak deflection limit, the analytic expression of deflection angle of the subject asymptotically flat metric in $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity is determined using the Gauss Bonnet theorem. Considering M87* as a lens, weak deflection angle is used to study the image magnification and image distortion for primary and secondary images. It is shown that image distortion satisfies the hypothesis of Virbhadra. Moreover, it is seen that our general expression of deflection angle reduces, as a special case, to the deflection angle of Schwarzschild metric in both weak and strong deflection limits.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Audio Transformer as a Foundational AI Tool for Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As gravitational wave detectors become more advanced and sensitive, the number of signals recorded by Advanced LIGO and Virgo from merging compact objects is expected to rise dramatically. This surge in detection rates necessitates the development of adaptable, scalable, and efficient tools capable of addressing a wide range of tasks in gravitational wave astronomy. Foundational AI models present a transformative opportunity in this context by providing a unified framework that can be fine tuned for diverse applications while leveraging the power of large scale pre training. In this work, we explore how advanced transformer models, specifically Whisper by OpenAI, can be adapted as a foundational model for gravitational wave data analysis. By fine tuning the encoder model of Whisper, originally trained on extensive audio data, and combining it with neural networks for specialized tasks, we achieve reliable results in detecting astrophysical signals and classifying transient noise artifacts or glitches. This represents the first application of open source transformer models, pre trained on unrelated tasks, for gravitational wave research, demonstrating their potential to enable versatile and efficient data analysis in the era of rapidly increasing detection rates.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $f$-mode oscillations frequency in Neutron Stars through Universal Relations in the realm of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs), superdense objects with exceptionally strong gravitational fields, provide an ideal laboratory for probing general relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime. They also present an exciting opportunity to explore new gravitational physics beyond the traditional framework of GR. Thus, investigating alternative theories of gravity in the context of superdense stars is intriguing and essential for advancing our understanding of gravitational phenomena in extreme environments. Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) is a modified theory of gravity that extends GR by including nonlinear terms involving the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu \nu}$. This study examines the effects of EMSG on the properties and behaviour of NSs by varying the free parameter $\alpha$. The hydrostatic equilibrium equations in the EMSG framework are derived and solved numerically to obtain mass-radius relations for soft, stiff, and intermediate equations of state (EOS). Observational measurements of NS masses and radii are used to constrain the fundamental-mode ($f$-mode) oscillation frequency through its universal relation with the tidal Love number and compactness. Results indicate that the Stiff EOS undergoes a phase transition at the highest energy densities and pressures, followed by the Intermediate and Soft EOSs, highlighting the distinctive characteristics of these models. Additionally, the study explores the impact of EOS choice on the sound speed profile of NSs, reaffirming the physical validity of the models across varying $\alpha$ values.</description>

      <title>Constraining the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity using cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the late-time accelerating Universe and the formation of large-scale structures within the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity framework, specifically using the $f(Q)$-gravity model, in light of recent cosmological data. After reviewing the background history of the Universe, and the linear cosmological perturbations, we consider the toy model $F(Q) = \alpha\sqrt{Q}+\beta$ ( where $Q$ represents nonmetricity, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model parameters) for further analysis. To evaluate the cosmological viability of this model, we utilize 57 Observational Hubble Data (OHD) points, 1048 supernovae distance modulus measurements (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate data points (f-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions (f$\sigma_8$) datasets. Through a detailed statistical analysis, the comparison between our model and $\Lambda$CDM has been conducted after we compute the best-fit values through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Based on the results, we obtain the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 69.20^{+4.40}_{{-}2.10}$ and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum normalization $\sigma_8 = 0.827^{+0.03}_{{-}0.01}$. These values suggest that our model holds significant promise in addressing the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present all possible analytical solutions of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in Einstein-aether theory for all values of the cosmological constant and spatial curvature with many reasonable values of the equation-of-state parameter. We analyze the dynamics of each model analytically and also graphically by plotting the geometric radius, Hubble and deceleration parameters along with the effective energy conditions. All our results are compared with the corresponding models in General Relativity. The two key results are (i) the aether does not qualitatively change the dynamics of the cosmological models but merely scales the geometric radius, Hubble, and deceleration parameters, and (ii) we found eight models that are entirely void of any aether, meaning in such a universe aether does not play any role cosmologically, although it affects the solar system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating superradiance in cylinders has recently been observed experimentally using acoustic waves to shed light on the understanding of the superradiant phenomenon in black holes. In this paper, for the first time, we study superradiance in acoustic black holes through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation using COMSOL multiphysics. We find that superradiance can occur in acoustic black holes when the general superradiance condition is met. We also find the amplification effect is significantly weaker in acoustic black holes than in regular cylinders, due to the absorption in such structure.</description>

      <title>Environmental gravitational decoherence with higher derivative theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the decoherence in a quantum system induced by interaction with gravitational degrees of freedom that are part of a higher derivative theory. The deformation of a mass distribution due to gravitational waves acquires naturally a mass quadrupole moment. This adds higher derivative dynamics of the quadrupole moment to the unitary evolution of the system, where the quadrupole moment oscillates with the gravitational frequencies following a higher derivative theory. The consequence of higher derivatives in the dynamics is that the system is described by four canonical variables. This departure from the usual particle position and momentum operators gives an entirely different interpretation of the decoherence basis. This model focuses on the open dynamics of the quadrupole moment, rather than on individual particles. As such, a short example is given to utilize quadrupole measurements to probe gravitational decoherence and noise. We first derive a Langevin equation for a lower derivative model and show how higher derivatives naturally emerge on the boundary. A quantum master equation is derived for the emerging quadrupole moment, considering that the environment is a higher derivative theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Resonance Theory: An Evolutionary Approach to Universal Rest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensional Resonance Theory proposes that gravity and fundamental forces can be interpreted as emergent phenomena arising from three-dimensional waves (3D) projected onto lower dimensions. To test the internal consistency of this proposal, we analyze the phi4 kink in (1+1) dimensions, an established topological defect with a well-known oscillation spectrum. We introduce an emergent gravitational term, h00(x), regulated by a coupling parameter G, under a linearized regime valid up to G = 0.02. Using numerical methods, including the shooting method and fine-tuning in Mathematica, we solve for both h00(x) and kink fluctuations, evaluating the fundamental eigenvalue omega^2. Our results show that, for G &lt;= 0.02, omega^2 remains very close to 1.0, virtually unchanged from the case without gravity. This indicates that the adopted emergent gravity does not break the topological stability of the phi4 kink, demonstrating the initial robustness of the theory. We discuss the implications of these findings, connections to other emergent gravity approaches, and extensions to nonlinear regimes, higher-dimensional frameworks, and time quantization. While presenting a novel perspective, the theory offers a coherent framework capable of unifying vibrational concepts and topological structures, reinforcing its potential to unify fundamental forces under vibrational logic extending to time quantization and the cohesion of cosmological and subatomic scales.</description>

      <title>Fate of Mixmaster Chaos in a Deformed Algebra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the anisotropic Bianchi models, and in particular the Bianchi Type IX known as the Mixmaster universe, where the Misner anisotropic variables obey Deformed Commutation Relations inspired by Quantum Gravity theories. We consider three different deformations, two of which have been able to remove the initial singularity similarly to Loop Quantum Cosmology when implemented to the single volume variable. Here, the two-dimensional Algebras naturally implement a form of Non-Commutativity between the space variables that affects the dynamics of the anisotropies. In particular, we implement the modifications in their classical limit, where the Deformed Commutators become Deformed Poisson Brackets. We derive the modified Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz map in all the three cases, and we study the fate of the chaotic behavior that the model classically presents. Depending on the sign of the deformation, the dynamics will either settle into oscillations between two almost-constant angles, or stop reflecting after a finite number of iterations and reach the singularity as one last simple Kasner solution. In either case, chaos is removed.</description>

      <title>New Black Hole Solutions of Second and First Order Formulations of Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the so-called Palatini formulation of General Relativity and of its modifications and extensions, we consider an analogous formulation of the dynamics of a self-interacting gauge field which is determined by non-linear extension of Maxwell's theory, usually known as nonlinear electrodynamics. In this first order formalism the field strength and the gauge potential are treated, a priori as independent, and, as such, varied independently in order to produce the field equations. Accordingly we consider within this formalism alternative and generalized non-linear Lagrangian densities. Several new spherically-symmetric objects are constructed analytically and their main properties are studied. The solutions are obtained in flat spacetime ignoring gravity and for the self-gravitating case with emphasis on black holes. As a background for comparison between the first and second order formalisms, some of the solutions are obtained by the conventional second order formalism, while for others a first order formalism is applied. Among the self-gravitating solutions we find new black holes and study their main characteristics. Some of the solutions can regularize the total energy of a point charge although their black hole counterparts are not regular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole, described by rotating C-metric, especially the case in Nariai limit, which are related to Kerr-CFT correspondence but differs in that the outer horizon will coincide the acceleration horizon and the extremal geometry is described by $dS_{2}$ rather than $AdS_{2}$. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

Abstract: We present a stable cosmological model of a closed universe in the presence of conventional scalar field. The stability of the model and absence of singularity is ensured by spatial curvature without the need for additional peculiar matter. We reconstruct the Lagrangian and numerically compute observational predictions, including the number of e-folds, the spectral index $n_s$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We present several sets of parameters that satisfy the current observational data.</description>

      <title>The (in)stability of quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in the hyperboloidal framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the test Klein-Gordon field and gravitational perturbations of scalar, vector, and tensor type are thoroughly investigated and put into thirteen typical classes. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. These lead to the existence of unstable modes ($\text{Im} \omega&lt;0$), and the presence of gravitational wave echoes. These rich phenomenons are inherent in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, rather than artificially introduced by hand. What's more, the (in)stability of quasinormal modes are studied in frequency domain and time domain, respectively. For the frequency aspect, the pseudospectrum is used to account for the instability of the spectrum. For the time domain, we add a small bump to the effective potential, and find that the new waveform does not differ significantly from the original one, where the comparison is characterized by the so-called mismatch functions. This means that quasinormal modes are stable in time domain. In this way, our study reveals the non-equivalence of the stability of quasinormal modes in the frequency domain and the time domain. We also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of the hyperboloidal approach.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we construct a broad family of spacetimes with spherically symmetric thin shells in unimodular gravity. We analyze the dynamical stability of the configurations under perturbations preserving the symmetry. In particular, we consider the case of thin shells with charge surrounding vacuum, obtaining stable configurations for suitable values of the parameters. We compare our results with those corresponding to general relativity.</description>

      <title>A polynomial affine model of gravity: after ten years</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polynomial affine model of gravity was proposed as an alternative to metric and metric-affine gravitational models. What at the beginning was thought as a source of unpredictability, the presence of many terms in the action, turned out to be a milestone, since it contains all possible combinations of the fields compatible with the covariance under diffeomorphisms. Here, we present a review of the advances in the analysis of the model after ten years of its proposal, and sketch the guideline of our future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Topological dark energy from black-hole formations and mergers through the gravity-thermodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach in the case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, and its corresponding Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy, which due to the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem it is related to the Euler characteristic of the Universe topology. However, we consider the realistic scenario where we have the formation and merger of black holes that lead to topology changes, which induce entropy changes in the Universe horizon. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector of topological origin. We estimate the black-hole formation and merger rates starting from the observed star formation rate per redshift, which is parametrized very efficiently by the Madau-Dickinson form, and finally we result to a dark-energy energy density that depends on the cosmic star formation rate density, on the fraction $f_{\text{BH}}$ of stars forming black holes, on the fraction of black holes $f_\text{merge}$ that eventually merge, on the fraction $ f_{\text{bin}}$ of massive stars that are in binaries, on the average mass of progenitor stars that will evolve to form black holes $ \langle m_{\text{prog}} \rangle $, as well as on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. We investigate in detail the cosmological evolution, obtaining the usual thermal history. Concerning the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, we show that at intermediate redshifts it exhibits phantom-like or quintessence-like behavior according to the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while at early and late times it tends to the cosmological constant value. Finally, we study the effect of the other model parameters, showing that for the whole allowed observationally estimated ranges, the topological dark-energy equation-of-state parameter remains within its observational bounds.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the problem of generalizing the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms for general quadratic theories of gravity and develop a new method to obtain them. From these terms we derive the junction conditions for a subset of this family of theories that includes Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity. We re-obtain the well-known results for GB theory, generalize them to other quadratic theories and compare the resulting junction conditions with the ones already derived in the literature using other methods.</description>

      <title>Causality and Stability from Acoustic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions form backgrounds which spontaneously break Lorentz invariance. We investigate the dynamics of free scalar perturbations on general anisotropic backgrounds. We demonstrate that the phonons move on null geodesics of an acoustic spacetime described by its own metric and own connection featuring nonmetricity with respect to the usual spacetime metric. We give distinct physical interpretations to the acoustic metric and its inverse. The first defines rays and their phase velocities. The latter defines momenta and the dispersion relation. We classify possible acoustic geometries and provide a physical interpretation for them.
  We discuss the phonon properties that moving observers, inequivalent owing to the breaking of Lorentz invariance, would measure. Ghosts and true gradient instabilities are to be read off from invariant properties of the acoustic metric - its signature and determinant. However, the choice of the observer's frame can cause some confusion and paradoxes, including apparent instabilities. For instance, complex phonon energies can appear entirely due to the ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem in the frame chosen. On the other hand, unbounded negative phonon energies can appear, without ghosts or gradient instabilities, for observers moving supersonically, when phonon Cherenkov radiation can be emitted.
  The action for phonons also gives an acoustically covariantly conserved energy-momentum tensor (EMT) which is, however, not conserved in the usual spacetime. Nonetheless, in the presence of an acoustic timelike Killing vector, the acoustic Hamiltonian functional is a conserved charge in both the acoustic and in the usual spacetimes, and even has the same value in both. Thus, the acoustic Hamiltonian can be used to bound the motion of phonons interacting with other species living in the usual spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We numerically construct the spectrum of the Laplacian on Page's inhomogeneous Einstein metric on $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}}^2$ by reducing the problem to a (singular) Sturm-Liouville problem in one dimension. We perform a perturbative analysis based upon a closely related, exactly solvable problem that strongly supports our results. We also study the spectrum of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on symmetric traceless transverse two-tensors. The method relies on both the isometries of the Page metric and pseudospectral methods to numerically solve the resulting ODEs.</description>

      <title>Accidental Symmetry Near Extreme Spinning Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near the horizon of extremal charged black holes, an accidental symmetry is known to act on zero-temperature perturbations, transforming them into finite-temperature ones. In this paper, we uncover the corresponding accidental symmetry of the vacuum Einstein equation near the horizon of extremal spinning black holes. To do so, we first devise a new method of deriving the symmetry near the ${\rm AdS}_2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometry of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om, using a new scaling coordinate transformation that unifies the near-horizon limits of extremal and near-extremal black holes in a way that is regular at zero temperature. We use our new method to obtain the accidental symmetry in the near-horizon of extreme Kerr (NHEK). We show that accidental symmetries combine neatly with the near-horizon isometries inside a Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to find a geometric object underlying the cosmological wavefunction for Tr($\phi^3$) theory, generalizing associahedra and surfacehedra for scattering amplitudes. In this note we describe a new class of polytopes -- "cosmohedra" -- that provide a natural solution to this problem. Cosmohedra are intimately related to associahedra, obtained by "blowing up" faces of the associahedron in a simple way, and we provide an explicit realization in terms of facet inequalities that further "shave" the facet inequalities of the associahedron. We also discuss a novel way for computing the wavefunction from cosmohedron geometry that extends the usual connection with polytope canonical forms. We illustrate cosmohedra with examples at tree-level and one loop; the close connection to surfacehedra suggests the generalization to all loop orders. We also briefly describe "cosmological correlahedra" for full correlators. We speculate on how the existence of cosmohedra might suggest a "stringy" formulation for the cosmological wavefunction/correlators, generalizing the way in which the Minkowski sum decomposition of associahedra naturally extend particle to string amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Modular Intersections, Time Interval Algebras and Stringy AdS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincar\'e horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a Twisted Modular Inclusion and a Twisted Modular Intersection property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times.
  Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</description>

      <title>Primary scalar hair in Gauss-Bonnet black holes with Thurston horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct novel asymptotically locally AdS$_5$ black hole solutions of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point, supported by a scalar field that generates primary hair. The strength of the scalar field is governed by an independent integration constant; when this constant vanishes, the spacetime reduces to a black hole geometry devoid of hair. The existence of these solutions is intrinsically tied to the horizon metric, which is modeled by three non-trivial Thurston geometries: Nil, Solv, and $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The quadratic part of the scalar field action corresponds to a conformally coupled scalar in five dimensions -an invariance of the matter sector that is explicitly broken by the introduction of a quartic self-interaction. These black holes are characterized by two distinct parameters: the horizon radius and the temperature. Notably, there exists a straight line in this parameter space along which the horizon geometry exhibits enhanced isometries, corresponding to solutions previously reported in JHEP 02, 014 (2014). Away from this line, for a fixed horizon radius and temperatures above or below a critical value, the metric's isometries undergo spontaneous breaking. Employing the Regge-Teitelboim approach, we compute the mass and entropy of these solutions, both of which vanish. Despite this, only one of the integration constants can be interpreted as hair, as the other modifies the local geometry at the conformal boundary. Finally, for Solv horizon geometries, we extend these hairy solutions to six dimensions.</description>

      <title>Holographic fermions in the Dyonic Gubser-Rocha black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fermionic properties of a dyonic Gubser-Rocha model in the context of gauge/gravity duality. This model incorporates both a magnetic field and momentum relaxation. We have derived this model's scaling exponent, revealing the influence of the magnetic field and momentum relaxation on low-energy physics. As the magnetic field strength and momentum relaxation increase, the spectral function of the dual field changes significantly. Specifically, we observe variations in the scaling exponent, Fermi momentum, and dispersion relations as the magnetic field increases, highlighting the system's transition from a Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid, and eventually to an insulating state. Our analysis of the magneto-scattering rate reveals that it is nearly zero in the Fermi liquid region, increases significantly in the non-Fermi liquid region, and ultimately arrives at a maximum value in the insulating state.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the equivalence between dark energy and radiation using gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differently from the equivalence time between either matter and radiation or dark energy and matter, the equivalence between dark energy and radiation occurs between two subdominant fluids, since it takes place in the matter dominated epoch. However, dark energy--radiation equivalence may correspond to a \emph{cosmographic bound} since it strongly depends on how dark energy evolves. Accordingly, a possible model-independent bound on this time would give hints on how dark energy evolves in time. In this respect, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be used, in fact, as tracers to obtain cosmic constraints on this equivalence. Consequently, based on observed GR data from the $E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation, we here go beyond by simulating additional GRB data points and investigating two distinct equivalence epochs: 1) dark energy--radiation, and 2) dark energy--radiation with matter. We thus extract constraints on the corresponding two redshifts adopting Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations by means of two methods: the first performing the GRB calibration and the cosmological fit steps independently, and the second performing these steps simultaneously by resorting a hierarchical Bayesian regression. To keep the analysis model-independent, we consider a generic dark energy model, with the unique constraint to reduce to the $\Lambda$CDM at $z=0$. Our findings are thus compared to theoretical predictions, indicating that the $\Lambda$CDM model is statistically favored to predict such an equivalence time, though a slow evolution with time cannot be fully excluded. Finally, we critically re-examine the Hubble constant tension in view of our outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the analogy between graviton emission in a thermal radiation environment and the laser mechanism, where photons of the same momentum and polarization are amplified. Using interaction picture perturbation theory, we analyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in a squeezed vacuum state, describing the inflationary graviton state. During the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, we find secular growth in the graviton number, leading to the breakdown of perturbative analysis within approximately ten Hubble times after reheating. We also explore analogous effects in a Minkowski background. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at temperatures of $O(10)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at $O(100)$ Hz could be enhanced, suggesting a mechanism to amplify gravitational wave signals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it points to potential advancements in gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Re(l)ality: The View From Nowhere vs. The View From Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the fiber bundle framework, this work investigates the conceptual and mathematical foundations of reference frames in General Relativity by contrasting two paradigms. The View from Nowhere interprets frame representations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the View from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting reality itself. This conception of reality is termed Relality. The paper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these views, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation of ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated approach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of theoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a relational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>SgrA* spin and mass estimates through the detection of multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the parameter estimation accuracy that can be achieved for the mass and spin of SgrA*, the SMBH in our Galactic Center, by detecting multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs). XMRIs are formed by brown dwarfs (BD) inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH), thus emitting gravitational waves (GWs) inside the detection band of future space-based detectors such as LISA and TianQin. Theoretical estimates suggest the presence of approximately 10 XMRIs emitting detectable GWs, making them some of the most promising candidates for space-based GW detectors. Our analysis indicates that even if individual sources have low SNRs ($\approx10$), high-precision parameter estimates can still be achieved by detecting multiple sources. In this case, the accuracy of the parameter estimates increases by approximately one to two orders of magnitude, at least. Moreover, by analyzing a small sample of 400 initial conditions for XMRIs formed in the Galactic Center, we estimate that almost 80 % of the detectable XMRIs orbiting SgrA* will have eccentricities between 0.43 to 0.95 and an SNR$\in [10,100]$. The remaining $\sim$20 % of the sources have an SNR$\in [100,1000]$ and eccentricities ranging from 0.25 to 0.92. Additionally, some XMRIs with high SNR are far from being circular. These loud sources with SNR$\approx 1000$ can have eccentricities as high as $e\approx0.7$; although their detection chances are low, representing $\lesssim$2 % of the detectable sources, their presence is not ruled out.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian inference with gapped LISA data using all-in-one TDI-$\infty$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA L-class mission, is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, with operations expected to begin in the next decade. LISA will enable studies of astrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data is the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Classical TDI mitigates this noise by algebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and spacecraft. However, data gaps caused by instrumental issues or operational interruptions complicate the process. These gaps affect multiple TDI samples due to the time delays inherent to the algorithm, rendering surrounding measurements unusable for parameter inference. In this paper, we apply the recently proposed variant of TDI known as TDI-$\infty$ to astrophysical parameter inference, focusing on the challenge posed by data gaps. TDI-$\infty$ frames the LISA likelihood numerically in terms of raw measurements, marginalizing over laser phase noises under the assumption of infinite noise variance. Additionally, TDI-$\infty$ is set up to incorporate and cancel other noise sources beyond laser noise, including optical bench motion, clock noise, and modulation noise, establishing it as an all-in-one TDI solution. The method gracefully handles measurement interruptions, removing the need to explicitly address discontinuities during template matching. We integrate TDI-$\infty$ into a Bayesian framework, demonstrating its superior performance in scenarios involving gaps. Compared to classical TDI, the method preserves signal integrity more effectively and is particularly interesting for low-latency applications, where the limited amount of available data makes data gaps particularly disruptive.</description>

      <title>Quantum flux operators in the fermionic theory and their supersymmetric extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct quantum flux operators with respect to the Poincar\'e symmetry in the massless Dirac theory at future null infinity. An anomalous helicity flux operator emerges from the commutator of the superrotation generators. The helicity flux operator corresponds to the local chiral symmetry which is the analog of superduality in the gauge theories. We also find its relation to the non-closure of the Lie transport of the spinor field around a loop. We discuss various algebras formed by these operators and constrain the test functions by the requirement of eliminating the non-local terms and satisfying the Jacobi identities. Furthermore, we explore their $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension in the Wess-Zumino model. There are four kinds of quantum flux operators, which correspond to the supertranslation, superrotation, superduality and supersymmetry, respectively. Interestingly, besides the expected supertranslation generator, a helicity flux operator will also emerge in the commutator between the superflux operators. We check that our flux algebra can give rise to the super-BMS and super-Poincar\'e algebras with appropriate choice of parameters. In the latter reduction, we find the helicity flux reduces to behaving like a $R$ symmetry generator in the commutator with the superflux. For completion, we derive the $R$ flux which also includes a charge flux for complex scalar besides the helicity flux for spinor field.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings for pedestrians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings represent an attractive source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. However, in contrast to other primordial GW sources whose signal may be modeled by simple analytic expressions, computing the GW signal from cosmic strings requires the numerical evaluation of complicated integral and sum expressions, which can become computationally costly in large parameter scans. This shortcoming motivates us to rederive the GW signal from a network of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation and based on the velocity-dependent one-scale model from a "pedestrian" perspective. That is, we derive purely analytical expressions for the total GW spectrum, which remain exact wherever possible and whose error can be tracked and reduced in a controlled way in crucial situations in which we are forced to introduce approximations. In this way, we obtain powerful formulas that, unlike existing results in the literature, are valid across the entire frequency spectrum and across the entire conceivable range of cosmic-string tensions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their characteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors, comment on the effect of changes in the effective number of degrees of freedom during radiation domination, and conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas that can readily be used in future studies.</description>

Abstract: We analyze oriented Riemannian 4-manifolds whose Weyl tensors $W$ satisfy the conformally invariant condition $W(T,\cdot,\cdot,T) = 0$ for some nonzero vector $T$. While this can be algebraically classified via $W$'s normal form, we find a further geometric classification by deforming the metric into a Lorentzian one via $T$. We show that such a $W$ will have the analogue of Petrov Types from general relativity, that only Types I and D can occur, and that each is completely determined by the number of critical points of $W$'s associated Lorentzian quadratic form. A similar result holds for the Lorentzian version of this question, with $T$ timelike.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. This theory is relevant for the quantization of general relativity coupled to Standard Model of elementary particles. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. Being a topological invariant of 4-dimensional manifolds with boundary, this state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), realized as a functor between the category of cobordisms and the category of Hilbert spaces. After an introduction to appropriate category theory concepts and the construction of the state sum, we provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQFT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vanishing (artificial) viscosity method has played a fundamental role in the theory of classical shock waves, both by providing a mollified limit that identifies the correct physical (Lax admissible) shock waves, and as a guiding principle in the design of numerical difference schemes for simulating shock waves. However, for relativistic fluid flow, the underlying dissipation mechanism based on the Euclidean Laplace operator violates Lorentz invariance (and hence the speed of light bound) -- the fundamental principle of Special Relativity. In this paper we introduce a simple dissipation mechanism for the relativistic Euler equations which is Lorentz invariant and consistent with the laws of Special Relativity. To establish basic consistency of the model for the study of shock waves, we prove existence and decay of Fourier Laplace mode solutions (implying dissipation), and we prove that 1-D shock profiles (viscous travelling wave approximations) exist if and only if the approximated shock waves are Lax admissible. Our analysis of shock profiles reveals an interesting simplification over classical artificial viscosity, leading to a one dimensional fixed point problem, due to the speed of light bound of Relativity.</description>

      <title>Effects of asymmetric dark matter on a magnetized neutron star: A two-fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between dark matter (DM) and highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), focusing on how DM particle mass, mass fraction, and magnetic field (MF) strength affect NS structure and stability. We consider self-interacting, non-annihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Using the QMC-RMF4 relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent magnetic fields, we investigate the magnetized equation of state and examine the accumulation of DM under various conditions. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo.</description>

Abstract: We complete the classification of all smooth 4-dimensional Kahler geometries admitting a twistor (conformal Killing-Yano) 2-form invariant under a 2-torus action. We establish that there are six geometrically distinct families, and we provide them in a simple form amenable to calculations and compute their curvature. We also find that for toric geometries the square norm of the twistor 2-form is quadratic in moment maps, and we are led to conjecture that this holds when less symmetry is present.</description>

      <title>Gravitational EFT for dissipative open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity, in light of recent developments on the EFT of dissipative hydrodynamics (HydroEFT). Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. A key aspect of dynamical gravity is that gravity couples to all degrees of freedom universally, hence the EFT has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the environment to which the energy escapes from the dissipative system of interest. We incorporate this effect by modeling the environment based on HydroEFT, assuming validity of the derivative expansion of the environment sector. For illustration, we apply our EFT recipe to a dissipative scalar field coupled to dynamical gravity that can be used, e.g., for dissipative inflation. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Holographic observers for time-band algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algebra of observables in a time band on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space in a theory of quantum gravity. Strictly speaking this algebra does not have a commutant because products of operators within the time band give rise to operators outside the time band. However, we show that in a state where the bulk contains a macroscopic observer, it is possible to define a coarse-grained version of this algebra with a non-trivial commutant, and a resolution limited by the observer's characteristics. This algebra acts on a little Hilbert space that describes excitations about the observer's state and time-translated versions of this state. Our construction requires a choice of dressing that determines how elements of the algebra transform under the Hamiltonian. At leading order in gravitational perturbation theory, and with a specific choice of dressing, our construction reduces to the modular crossed-product described previously in the literature. We also prove a theorem showing that this is the only crossed product of a type III$_1$ algebra resulting in an algebra with a trace. This trace can be used to define entropy differences between states in the little Hilbert space that are insensitive to the properties of the observer. We discuss some technical challenges in extending this construction to higher orders in perturbation theory. Lastly, we review the construction of interior operators in the eternal black hole and show that they can be written as elements of a crossed product algebra.</description>

Abstract: It is often assumed that the maximum number of independent states a black hole may contain is $N_{BH}=e^{S_{BH}}$, where $S_{BH}=A/4$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and $A$ the horizon area in Planck units. I present a simple and straightforward argument showing that the number of states that can be distinguished by local observers inside the hole must be greater than this number.</description>

      <title>A model-independent compact dynamical system formulation for exploring bounce and cyclic cosmological evolutions in $f(R)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the dynamical systems approach together with the cosmographic parameters, we present a model-independent dynamical system formulation for cosmology in f(R) gravity. The formulation is model-independent in the sense that one needs to specify not a particular functional form of f(R) a-priori, but rather a particular cosmological evolution, which fixes the cosmography. In a sense, our approach is the way around the reconstruction method. This is shown using both non-compact and compact dynamical variables. The focus in this paper is on the compact analysis since we demonstrate the applicability of this formulation using examples of bouncing and cyclic cosmology. In particular, our analysis reveals, in a model-independent manner, the problem of achieving such cosmologies when the universe is globally spatially flat and devoid of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational shockwaves are geometries where components of the transverse curvature have abrupt behaviour across null hypersurfaces, which are fronts of the waves. We develop a general approach to describe classical field theories on such geometries in a linearized approximation, by using free scalar fields as a model. Perturbations caused by shockwaves exist above the wave front and are solutions to a characteristic Cauchy problem with initial data on the wave front determined by a supertranslation of ingoing fields. A special attention is paid to perturbations of fields of pointlike sources generated by plane-fronted gravitational shockwaves. One has three effects: conversion of non-stationary perturbations into an outgoing radiation, a spherical scalar shockwave which appears when the gravitational wave hits the source, and a plane scalar shockwave accompanying the initial gravitational wave. Our analysis is applicable to gravitational shockwaves of a general class including geometries sourced by null particles and null branes.</description>

      <title>Parametrized tests of general relativity using eccentric compact binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical population simulations predict that a subset of dynamically formed binary black holes (BBHs) may possess eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.1$ at a gravitational wave (GW) frequency of $10 \,\text{Hz}$. Presently, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration tests general relativity (GR) assuming that the binary eccentricity has decayed well before it enters the detector's frequency band. Previous works have shown that binary eccentricity can bias GR tests if unaccounted for. Here we develop two methods to extend parametrized tests of GR to eccentric binaries. The first method extends the standard null parametrized test for quasicircular binaries by adding fractional deviations at each post-Newtonian (PN) order in the eccentric part of the GW phasing (assuming the small-eccentricity limit). Simultaneous measurement of the circular and eccentric deviation parameters ($\delta\hat{\varphi}, \delta\hat{\varphi}^e$) allows us to constrain deviations from GR for eccentric binaries. While strong constraints on the deviation parameters are not achievable with LIGO's projected sensitivity, the multibanding of LISA and CE observations can constrain these deviations to $|\delta\hat{\varphi}_2| \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-3}$ and $|\delta\hat{\varphi}^e_2|\lesssim 2\times 10^{-2}$. The second method looks for GR deviations in the rate of periastron advance ($\Delta\alpha$). The parameter $\Delta\alpha$ ($\Delta\alpha^{\rm GR} \to 0$) can be constrained with LIGO to $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 4 \times 10^{-2}$ (with $1 \sigma$ confidence). Multiband sources observed by LISA and CE provide an improved constraint of $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 3\times 10^{-5}$. The space-based detector DECIGO provides the best constraint on $\Delta\alpha$ with $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 8 \times 10^{-6}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime {to a quantum operator, playing the role of an renormalizable effective density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-K\"ahler formalism, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the {\em G-field}, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remain second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting spins of primordial black holes in a matter-dominated era based on peak theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the probability distribution for the spins of the primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed during an early matter-dominated era in the Universe. We employ the Zel'dovich approximation and focus on the linear-order effect of cosmological perturbations which causes the tidal torque. Assuming that the fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics, we apply the peak theory of random Gaussian variables to compute the root mean square (RMS) and the probability distribution of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ at their formation. The value of $a_{*}$ is evaluated through the angular momentum at the turn-around time. We find that the RMS $\bar{a}_{*}$ with a given amplitude of the fluctuation $\delta_{\rm{pk}}$ decreases with the amplitude. This behavior allows us to set the threshold value of the amplitude of the fluctuation through the under-extremal condition $\bar{a}_{*}&lt;1$. Then we discuss the impact of spin and anisotropic collapse on the production rate of PBHs. We find that, for $\sigma_{H}\leq 10^{-3}$ with $\sigma_{\rm H}$ being the square root of the variance of the fluctuation at the horizon reentry, the suppression from the spin effect is dominant, while the effect of anisotropy becomes more important for $\sigma_{H}&gt;10^{-3}$. Since $\bar{a}_{*}$ can be written as a function of $\nu:=\delta_{\rm{pk}}/\sigma_{\rm H}$, we can obtain the probability distribution of $\bar a_*$, $P(\bar a_*)$, through the probability distribution of $\nu$ characterized by a given power spectrum of the fluctuation. $P(\bar a_*)$ depends on $\sigma_{\rm H}$ and the parameter $\gamma$ that characterizes the width of the power spectrum. It is shown that, in the parameter regions of our interests, substantial values of PBH spins are expected in contrast to the PBH formation in a radiation-dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Removing naked singularities in static axially symmetric spacetimes by patching with the flat spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate static, axially symmetric spacetimes without naked singularities that are constructed by patching Weyl class spacetimes with the flat spacetimes. Once the exterior geometry is specified, the junction conditions determine the shape of a thin shell, which is the boundary between the two patched spacetimes, and the distribution of the energy and pressure on this shell, leaving a parameter representing the shell size free. We examine the cases where the exterior of the shell is given by Curzon--Chazy or Zipoy--Voorhees spacetimes. For each case, we find a lower bound on the shell size. Additionally, we find that the weak and null energy conditions are satisfied for any shell size, while the dominant energy condition is satisfied for sufficiently large shells. These results provide concrete examples of non-singular spacetimes with non-spherically symmetric exteriors that respect the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Greybody Factors of Charged Symmergent Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate quasinormal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors within the framework of Symmergent gravity, an emergent gravity model with an $R + R^2$ curvature sector. Building on our previous work on static spherically-symmetric solutions [Class. Quant. Grav. 40 (2023) 19, 195003], we explore the effects of the key parameters, including the quadratic curvature coupling parameter $c_{\rm O}$ and the vacuum energy parameter $\alpha$. For both scalar and electromagnetic perturbations, an increase in $\alpha$ leads to a nearly linear rise in both oscillation frequencies and damping rates. The other parameter $c_{\rm O}$ affects the QNMs spectrum nonlinearly. Additionally, the charge $Q$ of the black hole introduces nonlinear behavior, where higher charges amplify the black hole's electromagnetic field, resulting in increased oscillation frequencies and faster stabilization. These findings enhance our understanding of charged black hole stability and gravitational wave astrophysics. Further, the analysis of greybody factors reveals that increasing $\alpha$, $c_{\rm O}$, and $Q$ reduces the absorption of radiation, with electromagnetic perturbations reaching maximum absorption at slightly lower frequencies compared to scalar perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of scalar perturbations around a magnetized stationary compact object in General Relativity. The considered object is one of the simplest exact solutions of Einstein electrovacuum equations corresponding to a spheroidal body endowed with a dipole magnetic moment. It is effectively constructed by imposing a perfect reflection (mirror) boundary condition on a central region of the Gutsunaev-Manko spacetime. A time-domain analysis of the perturbations reveals a quasinormal phase followed by a power-law decaying tail. Our findings suggest that the exterior region of the magnetized compact object is stable in the entire parameter space. Moreover, the system tends to become generically more stable the stronger the magnetization of the central object is. Such findings can be useful for the qualitative understanding of more realistic astrophysical situations involving highly magnetized sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kerr-MOG black hole has attracted widespread research interest and has been widely used in fields such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters, and the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. In this paper, we mainly focus on dynamics of the charged particle around Kerr-MOG black hole. At first, the field equations for the charged particle under the Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG) theory are presented. Then, according to the characteristics of the Hamiltonian system, the Hamiltonian can be decomposed into five integrable parts, and three kinds of explicit symplectic algorithms are constructed. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm ($PR{K_6}4$) is the optimal one. At last, the Poincar\'e section and the fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) are used to explore dynamic evolution of the particle. From the numerical results, it is easy to find that the energy $E$, the angular momentum $L$, the magnetic field parameter $\beta$, the black hole spin parameter $a$, and the gravitational field strength parameter $\alpha$ have an impact on the motion of the particle. In particular, the chaotic region increases as $E$, $\beta$, or $\alpha$ increases, but decreases with the increases of $a$ or $L$. Moreover, when any two of the five parameters are applied simultaneously, it is easy to observe that $a$ and $L$ play a dominant role.</description>

Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.02552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of a causal time-evolution of a conserved nonlocal physical quantity in a globally hyperbolic spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. The role of the `global time' is played by a chosen Cauchy temporal function $\mathcal{T}$, whereas the instantaneous configurations of the nonlocal quantity are modeled by probability measures $\mu_t$ supported on the corresponding time slices $\mathcal{T}^{-1}(t)$. We show that the causality of such an evolution can be expressed in three equivalent ways: (i) via the causal precedence relation $\preceq$ extended to probability measures, (ii) with the help of a probability measure $\sigma$ on the space of future-directed continuous causal curves endowed with the compact-open topology and (iii) through a causal vector field $X$ of $L^\infty_{\textrm{loc}}$-regularity, with which the map $t \mapsto \mu_t$ satisfies the continuity equation in the distributional sense. In the course of the proof we find that the compact-open topology is sensitive to the differential properties of the causal curves, being equal to the topology induced from a suitable $H^1_{\textrm{loc}}$-Sobolev space. This enables us to construct $X$ as a vector field in a sense `tangent' to $\sigma$. In addition, we discuss the general covariance of descriptions (i)-(iii), unraveling the geometrical, observer-independent notions behind them.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime: the case of de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06046v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before we ask what the quantum gravity theory is, it is a legitimate quest to formulate a robust quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). Several conceptual problems, especially unitarity loss (pure states evolving into mixed states), have raised concerns over several decades. In this paper, acknowledging the fact that {time} is a parameter in quantum theory, which is different from its status in the context of General Relativity (GR), we start with a "quantum first approach" and propose a new formulation for QFTCS based on the discrete spacetime transformations which offer a way to achieve unitarity. We rewrite the QFT in Minkowski spacetime with a direct-sum Fock space structure based on the discrete spacetime transformations and geometric superselection rules. Applying this framework to QFTCS, in the context of de Sitter (dS) spacetime, we elucidate how this approach to quantization complies with unitarity and the observer complementarity principle. We then comment on understanding the scattering of states in de Sitter spacetime. Furthermore, we discuss briefly the implications of our QFTCS approach to future research in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Time Transformations Between the Solar System Barycenter, Earth, and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic corrections are essential for time transformations between geocentric, solar system barycentric, and luni-centric reference systems to account for differences in gravitational potential and relative motion. As the primary reference for Earth-based systems, Terrestrial Time (TT) provides the foundation for precise synchronization across spatial and temporal frameworks. To ensure consistency with TT, Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) must exhibit no average rate difference from TT. Although the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has established resolutions for transformations between TT and TDB, extending these frameworks to define a lunar surface time scale (TL) is essential for advancing lunar exploration. This paper derives the (TL - TT) transformation, quantifying a secular drift of 56.0256 us/day and periodic terms, with the largest amplitude of ~0.470 us at the mean anomalistic period. Additionally, the TT-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates are computed, achieving sub-nanosecond timing precision. These transformations, implemented in JPL ephemeris generation software, provide a robust framework for high-fidelity relativistic models of lunar timekeeping, enabling further refinements and supporting navigation, communication, and scientific operations in cis-lunar space.</description>

      <title>Soft synchronous gauge: principal value prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synchronous gauge in gravity ($g_{0 \lambda} = - \delta_{0 \lambda}$) is ill-defined due to the singularity at $p_0 = 0$ in the graviton propagator. Previously we studied "softening" this gauge by considering instead the gauge $n^\lambda g_{\lambda \mu} = 0$, $n^\lambda = (1, - \varepsilon (\partial^j \partial_j )^{- 1} \partial^k ) $ in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We now explore the possibility of using a principal value prescription (not in the standard Cauchy sense), which amounts, roughly speaking, to replacing singularities $p_0^{-j} \Rightarrow [ (p_0 + i \varepsilon )^{-j} + (p_0 - i \varepsilon )^{-j} ] / 2$, which then behave like distributions. We show that such a propagator follows upon adding to the action a gauge-violating term of a general form, which reduces to $ \sim \int f_\lambda \Lambda^{\lambda \mu} f_\mu \d^4 x $ with a constant operator $\Lambda^{\lambda \mu}$ depending on $\partial$ and a metric functional $f_\lambda$. The contribution of the ghost fields to the effective action is analysed. For the required intermediate regularization, the discrete structure of the theory at small distances is implied. It is shown that the ghost contribution can be disregarded in the limit $ \varepsilon \to 0$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic soft theorems and soft spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using universal predictions provided by classical soft theorems, we revisit the energy emission spectrum for gravitational scatterings of compact objects in the low-frequency expansion. We calculate this observable beyond the zero-frequency limit, retaining an exact dependence on the kinematics of the massive objects. This allows us to study independently the ultrarelativistic or massless limit, where we find agreement with the literature, and the small-deflection or post-Minkowskian (PM) limit, where we provide explicit results up to $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$. These confirm that the high-velocity limit of a given PM order is smoothly connected to the corresponding massless result whenever the latter is analytic in the Newton constant $G$. We also provide explicit expressions for the waveforms to order $\omega^{-1}$, $\log\omega$, $\omega(\log\omega)^2$ in the soft limit, $\omega\to0$, expanded up to sub-subleading PM order, as well as a conjecture for the logarithmic soft terms of the type $\omega^{n-1}(\log\omega)^{n}$ with $n\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Universal structure of islands in evaporating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation contains contributions from a region inside the black hole, which is called islands, implying that the Hawking radiation contains the information of islands. The boundary of the island is given by the quantum extremal surface, whose position is determined so that the entanglement entropy is extremized. In many cases of stationary black holes and a few cases of evaporating black holes, it was already confirmed that the quantum extremal surface is located outside the horizon for stationary black holes and is inside the horizon for evaporating black holes. In this paper, we calculate islands in general black holes and show that the island extends to the outside of the horizon for stationary black holes but is hidden inside the horizon for evaporating black holes independent of details of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around 1-100 TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase transition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from 10^{-4} Hz to 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional non-relativistic Hietarinta supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the non-relativistic regime of the Hietarinta gravity theory and its extension to supergravity. At the bosonic level, we derive the non-relativistic version of the Hietarinta model by employing a contraction process and addressing the non-degeneracy of the invariant metric. To incorporate supersymmetry, we apply the Lie algebra expansion method to obtain the non-relativistic formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ Hietarinta supergravity. Our results reveal that the non-relativistic Hietarinta theory encompasses the extended Bargmann (super)gravity as a special case, yet it differs significantly from other existing non-relativistic (super)gravity models. Furthermore, we generalize our analysis to include a cosmological constant term in the non-relativistic Hietarinta (super)gravity action and examine its effects on the torsion structure.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from an interrupted phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of primordial black hole formation via an interrupted phase transition during the early matter-dominated stage of reheating after inflation. In reheating, induced by the decay of a pressureless fluid dominating the Universe at the end of inflation, dubbed as reheaton, the temperature of the radiation bath typically increases, reaching a maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$, and then decreases. We consider a first-order phase transition induced by the increase of the temperature that is aborted as $T_{\rm max}$ is higher than the critical temperature but not sufficiently high for the bubble nucleation rate to overcome the expansion of the Universe. Although bubbles never fully occupy the space, some may be nucleated and expand until the temperature once again decreases to the critical temperature. We argue that these bubbles shrink and disappear as the temperature drops further, leaving behind macroscopic spherical regions with positive density perturbations. These perturbed regions accrete the surrounding matter (reheatons) and eventually collapse into primordial black holes whose mass continues to grow until the onset of radiation domination. We estimate the abundance of these primordial black holes in terms of the bubble nucleation rate at $T_{\rm max}$, and demonstrate that the abundance can be significantly large from a phenomenological perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct the classical phase space of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with positive cosmological constant on spatial slices with circle topology. This turns out to be somewhat more intricate than in the case of negative cosmological constant; this phase space has many singular points and is not even Hausdorff. Nonetheless, it admits a group-theoretic description which is quite amenable to quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma model encoding the ghost-free massive bigravity theory action as well as its Batalin-Vilkovisky extension in terms of the finite-dimensional graded geometry of the target space. A characteristic feature of the construction is that the target space is realised as a quasi-regular submanifold of a linear graded manifold which, in turn, is a direct product of two copies of the shifted Poincar\'e or (anti-)de Sitter Lie algebra. This graded manifold comes equipped with a natural presymplectcic structure and the compatible pre-$Q$ structure which is a sum of the Chevalley-Eilenberg differentials of each copy of the Lie algebra and the interaction term. The constraints determining the submanifold are the supergeometrical realisation of the known Deser-van Nieuwenhuizen condition and its descendant.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity corrections to the spontaneous excitation of an accelerated atom interacting with a quantum scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) extends the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) by suggesting a minimum observable scale that includes the effects of quantum gravity, which is supposed to potentially result in observable effects far below the Planck energy scale, providing us the opportunity to explore the theory of quantum gravity through physical processes at low energy scale. In present work, we study the corrections induced by the GUP to the spontaneous radiation properties of a two-level atom interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field based on the DDC formalism. The GUP alters the correlation function of the scalar field, consequently affecting the radiative properties of atoms. We compute the rate of change in the mean atomic energy for an atom undergoing inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and uniform circular motion. We show that the GUP can enhance the spontaneous emission rate of an excited state atom in inertial motion; however, it does not alter the stability of the ground-state atom in vacuum. For an atom in uniformly accelerated and uniformly circular motion, the GUP can change both its spontaneous emission and spontaneous excitation rates, and the proper acceleration $a$ can significantly amplify the effect of the GUP on the spontaneous transition rates of the atom.</description>

      <title>Boundaries, frames and the issue of physical covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general focus, as well as broader conceptual implications. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. These two goals combine to identify a key open issue: a proper characterization of physical covariance, i.e. covariance across fully physical (as opposed to idealized) reference frames. The broader conceptual implications concern the influence of observers in physics and possible physical limits to objectivity.</description>

Abstract: These notes aim to provide an introduction to the basics of black hole thermodynamics. After explaining Bekenstein's original proposal that black holes have entropy, we discuss Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation, its analog for Rindler space in the Unruh effect, the Euclidean approach to black hole thermodynamics, some basics about von Neumann entropy and its applications, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, and the nature of a white hole.</description>
