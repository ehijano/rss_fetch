      <title>Coulomb drag in graphene/hBN/graphene moir\'e heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of Coulomb drag between graphene-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) moir\'e heterostructure with a moir\'e wavelength of ~10 nm and an intrinsic graphene with a lattice constant of ~0.25 nm. By tuning carrier densities of each graphene layer independently, we find that the charge carriers in moir\'e mini-bands, i.e., near the satellite Dirac point (sDP), can be coupled with the massless Fermions near the original Dirac point (oDP), strongly enough to generate a finite drag resistance. At high temperature ($T$) and large density ($n$), the drag resistances near both oDP and sDP follow a typical $n^{-1.5}$ and $T^2$ power law dependence as expected for the momentum transfer process and it also satisfies the layer reciprocity. In contrast, at low $T$, the layer reciprocity is broken in both regions that suggest dominant energy drag. Furthermore, quantitatively, the drag resistances near sDPs are smaller than those near oDP and they deviate from $T^2$ dependence below ~100 K. These results suggest that the coupling between the carriers in moir\'e mini-bands and those in original Dirac bands may not be of a simple Fermi liquid nature.</description>

      <title>Oblique spin injection to graphene via geometry controlled magnetic nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the geometry of magnetic nanowires, which define 1D contacts to an encapsulated graphene channel, to introduce an out-of-plane component in the polarisation of spin carriers. By design, the magnetic nanowires traverse the angled sides of the 2D material heterostructure. Consequently, the easy axis of the nanowires is inclined, and so the local magnetisation is oblique at the injection point. As a result, when performing non-local spin valve measurements we simultaneously observe both switching and spin precession phenomena, implying the spin population possesses both in-plane and out-of-plane polarisation components. By comparing the relative magnitudes of these components, we quantify the angle of the total spin polarisation vector. The extracted angle is consistent with the angle of the nanowire at the graphene interface, evidencing that the effect is a consequence of the device geometry. This simple method of spin-based vector magnetometry provides an alternative technique to define the spin polarisation in 2D spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence enhancement at the vertical van der Waals semiconductor-metal heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer intriguing new possibilities for optoelectronics with no analogues in bulk semiconductors. Yet, intrinsic defects in TMDCs limit the radiative exciton recombination pathways. As a result, the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) is limited. Methods like superacid treatment, electrical doping, and plasmonic engineering can inhibit nonradiative decay channels and enhance PL. Here, we show a more straightforward approach that allows PL enhancement. An engineered vertical van der Waals (vdW) metal-monolayer semiconductor junction (MSJ) results in PL enhancement of more than an order of magnitude at technologically relevant excitation powers. Such MSJ can be constructed by vertically stacking metals with suitable work function either above or below a monolayer semiconducting TMDC. Our experiments reveal that the underlying PL enhancement mechanism is to be the suppressed exciton quenching due to the absence of metal-induced gap states and weak Fermi level pinning, thanks to the vdW gapped interface between the metal and the TMDC. Our time-resolved PL measurements further indicate that reduced exciton-exciton annihilation, even at high generation rates, contributes to the observed PL enhancement. The PL intensity is further increased by the proximity of surface plasmons in the metal with the TMDC layer. Our findings shed light on the interaction at vdW metal-semiconductor interfaces and offer a path to improving the optoelectronic performance of semiconducting TMDCs.</description>

      <title>Voltage-insensitive stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions with double free layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (s-MTJ) is a promising component of probabilistic bit (p-bit), which plays a pivotal role in probabilistic computers. For a standard cell structure of the p-bit, s-MTJ is desired to be insensitive to voltage across the junction over several hundred millivolts. In conventional s-MTJs with a reference layer having a fixed magnetization direction, however, the stochastic output significantly varies with the voltage due to spin-transfer torque (STT) acting on the stochastic free layer. In this work, we study a s-MTJ with a "double-free-layer" design theoretically proposed earlier, in which the fixed reference layer of the conventional structure is replaced by another stochastic free layer, effectively mitigating the influence of STT on the stochastic output. We show that the key device property characterized by the ratio of relaxation times between the high- and low-resistance states is one to two orders of magnitude less sensitive to bias voltage variations compared to conventional s-MTJs when the top and bottom free layers are designed to possess the same effective thickness. This work opens a pathway for reliable, nanosecond-operation, high-output, and scalable spintronics-based p-bits.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis of entropy measure using regression model for terpyridine complex nanosheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical parameter, known as a topological index, is employed to represent the molecular structure of a compound by considering its graph-theoretical properties. In the study of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), topological indices are used to predict the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds. Graph entropies have evolved as information-theoretic tools to investigate the structural information of a molecular graph. In this research work, we compute the Nirmala index, the first and second inverse Nirmala index for terpyridine complex nanosheet $TCN_{n,m}$ with the help of its M-polynomial. Further, entropy measures based on Nirmala indices are calculated for terpyridine complex nanosheets. We expand this analysis to include visual comparisons, which could be useful in refining the structure for more effective implementation. Furthermore, using graphical and numerical methods, the correlation and comparison between the Nirmala indices and the corresponding entropy measurements are shown. The relationship between the Nirmala indices and associated entropy measurements is then examined using a regression model.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical switching to a heterochiral charge-density wave state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical control of correlated electronic states promises unprecedented tunability of novel functional materials. Tailored optical excitations can steer a system along non-equilibrium pathways to metastable states with specific structural or electronic properties. A much-desired feature is the reproducible and ultrafast switching to functional states. The light-induced hidden state of 1T-TaS$_{2}$, with its strongly enhanced conductivity and exceptionally long lifetime, represents a unique model system for studying the switching of correlated electronic states using femtosecond optical stimuli. However, despite intense investigation, the switching mechanism and the structural origins of the distinctive electronic properties of the hidden state have not been fully uncovered. Here, we use surface-sensitive electron diffraction in combination with a femtosecond optical quench to reveal coexistent charge-density wave chiralities as a new structural feature of the hidden state. We find that a single-pulse optical quench produces a state with long-range structural order and different weights of the two chiral enantiomorphs of the charge-density wave. Harnessing a double-pulse optical quench, we trace the origin of the mixed chirality to the transient electronic excitation of the host crystal. The coexistent long-range-order of both chiralities suggests the presence of extended heterochiral charge-density wave interfaces, which results in a higher-level, fractal-type moir\'{e} superstructure. Density functional theory simulations for such a charge-density wave moir\'{e} superstructure reveal multiple flat bands, Dirac cones, and a kagome electronic subsystem around the Fermi energy. Our findings shed light on novel electronic properties gained by chiral interface engineering, and create avenues for light-induced moir\'{e} superstructures in quasi-two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional magnetic conduction channels across zigzag graphene nanoribbon/hexagonal boron nitride heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the electronic structure of recently fabricated in-plane heterojunctions of zigzag graphene nanoribbons embedded in hexagonal boron nitride. We focus on hitherto unexplored interface configurations in which both edges of the nanoribbon are bonded to the same chemical species, either boron or nitrogen atoms. Using ab initio and mean-field Hubbard model calculations, we reveal the emergence of one-dimensional magnetic conducting channels at these interfaces. These channels originate from the energy shift of the magnetic interface states that is induced by charge transfer between the nanoribbon and hexagonal boron nitride. We further address the response of these heterojunctions to external electric and magnetic fields, demonstrating the tunability of energy and spin splittings in the electronic structure. Our findings establish that zigzag graphene nanoribbon/hexagonal boron nitride heterojunctions are a suitable platform for exploring and engineering spin transport in the atomically thin limit, with potential applications in integrated spintronic devices</description>

      <title>Fast characterization of multiplexed single-electron pumps with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient machine learning based automated framework for the fast tuning of single-electron pump devices into current quantization regimes. It uses a sparse measurement approach based on an iterative active learning algorithm to take targeted measurements in the gate voltage parameter space. When compared to conventional parameter scans, our automated framework allows us to decrease the number of measurement points by about an order of magnitude. This corresponds to an eight-fold decrease in the time required to determine quantization errors, which are estimated via an exponential extrapolation of the first current plateau embedded into the algorithm. We show the robustness of the framework by characterizing 28 individual devices arranged in a GaAs/AlGaAs multiplexer array, which we use to identify a subset of devices suitable for parallel operation at communal gate voltages. The method opens up the possibility to efficiently scale the characterization of such multiplexed devices to a large number of pumps.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation with hybrid parafermion-spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a universal set of single- and two-qubit quantum gates acting on a hybrid qubit formed by coupling a quantum dot spin qubit to a $\mathbb{Z}_{2m}$ parafermion qubit with arbitrary integer $m$. The special case $m=1$ reproduces the results previously derived for Majorana qubits. Our formalism utilizes Fock parafermions, facilitating a transparent treatment of hybrid parafermion-spin systems. Furthermore, we highlight the previously overlooked importance of particle-hole symmetry in these systems. We give concrete examples how the hybrid qubit system could be realized experimentally for $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_6$ parafermions. In addition, we discuss a simple readout scheme for the fractional parafermion charge via the measurement of the spin qubit resonant frequency.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-High Vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope with Pulse Tube and Joule-Thomson cooling operating at sub-pm z-noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a compact ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) system that does not need any external supply of cooling liquids. It achieves temperatures down to 1.5 K and a z-noise down to 300 fmRMS for the frequency range of 0.1 Hz - 5 kHz (feedback loop off). It employs a pulse tube cryocooler (PTC) and a Joule-Thomson (JT) stage inducing only small temperature oscillations at the STM with amplitude below 1 mK. The challenge to combine an effective vibrational decoupling from the PTC with sufficient thermal conduction is tackled by a multipartite approach. We realize a minimal stiffness of the UHV bellows that connect the PTC and the STM chamber. Fine Copper wires mechanically decouple the PTC stages from cooling plates that carry the thermal shields, the JT stage and the STM. Soft springs decouple the STM from the JT stage. Finally, the STM body has an optimized conical shape and is made of the light and stiff material Shapal Hi MSoft such that a strong reduction of low frequency vibrations results for the tunnel junction. The voltage noise in the tunnel junction is 0.12 mV and an RF antenna close to the tunnel junction provides radio frequency excitations up to 40 GHz with amplitudes up to 10 mV.</description>

      <title>Teaching ideal quantum measurement, from dynamics to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graduate course on ideal measurements, analyzed as dynamical processes of interaction between the tested system S and an apparatus A, described by quantum statistical mechanics. The apparatus A=M+B involves a macroscopic measuring device M and a bath B. The requirements for ideality of the measurement allow us to specify the Hamiltonian of the isolated compound system S+M+B. The resulting dynamical equations may be solved for simple models. Conservation laws are shown to entail two independent relaxation mechanisms: truncation and registration. Approximations, justified by the large size of M and of B, are needed. The final density matrix $\hat{\cal D}(t_f)$ of S+A has an equilibrium form. It describes globally the outcome of a large set of runs of the measurement. The measurement problem, i.e., extracting physical properties of individual runs from $\hat{\cal D}(t_f)$, then arises due to the ambiguity of its splitting into parts associated with subsets of runs. To deal with this ambiguity, we postulate that each run ends up with a distinct pointer value $A_i$ of the macroscopic M. This is compatible with the principles of quantum mechanics. Born's rule then arises from the conservation law for the tested observable; it expresses the frequency of occurrence of the final indications $A_i$ of M in terms of the initial state of S. Von Neumann's reduction amounts to updating of information due to selection of $A_i$. We advocate the terms $q$-probabilities and $q$-correlations when analyzing measurements of non-commuting observables. These ideas may be adapted to different types of courses.</description>

Abstract: We present a solid state system which spontaneously generates remarkable engraving patterns on the surface of Ge. The layered construction, with a metal film on the Ge surface, results in coupling of the metal catalyzed etching reaction with the long range stress field at the Ge - metal interface. The etching patterns generated have similarities with Turing patterns, hydrodynamic patterns, crack propagation, and biological form. We describe spirals, radial patterns, and more disordered structures. Euler buckling of the metal layer generates a characteristic wavelength for some patterns.</description>

      <title>Double-sided van der Waals epitaxy of topological insulators across an atomically thin membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) films provide a novel material platform for epitaxial growth of quantum heterostructures. However, unlike the remote epitaxial growth of three-dimensional bulk crystals, the growth of two-dimensional (2D) material heterostructures across atomic layers has been limited due to the weak vdW interaction. Here, we report the double-sided epitaxy of vdW layered materials through atomic membranes. We grow vdW topological insulators (TIs) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ by molecular beam epitaxy on both surfaces of atomically thin graphene or hBN, which serve as suspended 2D vdW "$\textit{substrate}$" layers. Both homo- and hetero- double-sided vdW TI tunnel junctions are fabricated, with the atomically thin hBN acting as a crystal-momentum-conserving tunnelling barrier with abrupt and epitaxial interface. By performing field-angle dependent magneto-tunnelling spectroscopy on these devices, we reveal the energy-momentum-spin resonant tunnelling of massless Dirac electrons between helical Landau levels developed in the topological surface states at the interface.</description>

      <title>Mott insulating phase and coherent-incoherent crossover across magnetic phase transition in 2D antiferromagnetic CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials, the interplay between magnetism and electron correlation can give rise to new ground states and lead to novel transport and optical properties. A fundamental question in these materials is how the electron correlation manifests and interacts with the magnetic orders. In this study, we demonstrate that the recently discovered 2D antiferromagnetic material, CrSBr, is a Mott insulator, through the combined use of resonant and temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techiniques, supplemented by dynamical mean-field theory analysis. Intriguingly, we found that as the system transitions from the antiferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phases, its Mott bands undergo a reconfiguration, and a coherent-incoherent crossover, driven by the dissolution of the magnetic order. Our findings reveal a distinctive evolution of band structure associated with magnetic phase transitions, shedding light on the investigation of intricate interplay between correlation and magnetic orders in strongly correlated van der Waals magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical magnetic Bloch points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bloch point represents a three-dimensional hedgehog singularity of a magnetic vector field in which the magnetization vanishes. However, standard micromagnetic theory, developed for magnetic moments of fixed lengths, lacks full applicability in studying such singularities. To address this gap, we study a Bloch point in a quantum Heisenberg model for the case of spin-1/2 particles. Performing an exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian as well as using density matrix renormalization group techniques, we obtain the ground state, which can be used to recover the corresponding magnetization profile. Our findings demonstrate a variation of the spin length in the quantum model, leading smoothly to zero magnetization at the Bloch point. Our results indicate the necessity of generalizing the classical micromagnetic model by adding the third degree of freedom of the spins: the ability to change its length. To this end, we introduce the micromagnetic $\mathbb{S}_{3}$-model, which enables the description of magnets with and without Bloch point singularities.</description>

      <title>Unusual Diffusivity in Strongly Disordered Quantum Lattices: Random Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in transport properties measurements of disordered materials and lattice simulations, using superconducting qubits, have rekindled interest in Anderson localization, motivating our study of highly disordered quantum lattices. Initially, our statistical analysis of localized eigenstates reveals a distinct transition between weak and strong disorder regimes, suggesting a random distribution of dimers in highly disordered systems. Subsequently, the random dimer model predicts an oscillating diffusivity that decays as $t^{-1/2}$, is inversely proportional to the disorder strength, and maintains a constant frequency with an initial phase shift of $\pi/4$. The first peak exhibits a universal scaling of $\sigma^{-1}$ both in peak time and amplitude. Finally, we find that stochastic noise suppresses these oscillations and induces hopping between localized eigenstates, resulting in constant diffusion over long times. Our predictions challenge the conventional understanding of incoherent hopping under strong disorder. This offers new insights to optimize disordered systems for optoelectrical and quantum information technologies.</description>

Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out of equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of physics, a pivotal moment occurred six decades ago when Brian Josephson made a groundbreaking prediction, setting in motion a series of events that would eventually earn him the prestigious Nobel Prize eleven years later. This prediction centered around what is now known as the Josephson effect, a phenomenon with far-reaching implications. At the heart of this effect lies the Josephson junction (JJ), a device that has become a linchpin in various scientific applications. This chapter delves into the foundational principles of the Josephson effect and the remarkable properties of JJs. From their role in metrology to their application in radiation detectors, these junctions have ushered in a new era of electronics. Exploiting the unique features of superconductive devices, such as high speed, low dissipation, and dispersion, JJs find today practical implementation in the development of superconductive qubits and nanotechnology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnon band structures in altermagnets are characterized by an energy splitting of modes with opposite chirality, even in the absence of applied external fields and relativistic effects, due to an anisotropy in the Heisenberg exchange interactions. We perform quantitative atomistic spin dynamics simulations based on ab initio electronic structure calculations on rutile RuO$_2$, a prototypical "d-wave" altermagnet, to study magnon currents generated by thermal gradients. We report substantial spin Seebeck and spin Nernst effects, i.e., longitudinal or transverse spin currents, depending on the propagation direction of the magnons with respect to the crystal, together with a finite spin accumulation associated with non-linearities in the temperature profile. Our findings are consistent with the altermagnetic spin-group symmetry, as well as predictions from linear spin wave theory and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory.</description>

Abstract: Confined ion transport is involved in nanoporous ionic systems. However, it is challenging to mechanistically predict its electrical characteristics for rational system design and performance evaluation using electrical circuit model due to the gap between the circuit theory and the underlying physical chemistry. Here we demonstrate that machine learning can bridge this gap and produce physics-based nano-circuitry, based on equation discovery from the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck simulation results where an anomalous constructive diffusion-migration interplay of confined ions is unveiled. This bridging technique allows us to gain physical insights of ion dynamics in nanoporous electrodes, such as the non-ideal cyclic voltammetry.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced insulator-to-metal transition in few-layer FePS$_3$ at 1.5 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials the application of pressure often induces a giant lattice collapse, which can subsequently drive an associated Mott transition. Here, we investigate room-temperature layer-dependent insulator-metal transition (IMT) and probable spin-crossover (SCO) in vdW magnet, FePS$_3$, under high-pressure using micro-Raman scattering. Experimentally obtained spectra, in agreement with the computed Raman modes, indicate evidence of IMT of FePS$_3$ started with a thickness-dependent critical pressure ($P_c$) which reduces to 1.5 GPa in trilayer flakes compared to 10.8 GPa for the bulk counterpart. Using a phenomenological model, we argue that strong structural anisotropy in few-layer flakes enhances the in-plane strain under applied pressure and is, therefore, ultimately responsible for reducing the critical pressure for the IMT with decreasing layer numbers. Reduction of the critical pressure for phase transition in vdW magnets to 1-2 GPa marks the possibility of using intercalated few-layers in the field-effect transistor device architecture, and thereby, avoiding the conventional use of the diamond anvil cell (DAC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering conduction-band valley couplings is a key challenge for Si-based spin qubits. Recent work has shown that the most reliable method for enhancing valley couplings entails adding Ge concentration oscillations to the quantum well. However, ultrashort oscillation periods are difficult to grow, while long oscillation periods do not provide useful improvements. Here, we show that the main benefits of short-wavelength oscillations can be achieved in long-wavelength structures through a second-order coupling process involving Brillouin-zone folding induced by shear strain. We finally show that such strain can be achieved through common fabrication techniques, making this an exceptionally promising system for scalable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

Abstract: Using the atomistic tight-binding method in combination with symmetry analysis and extended effective mass theory we derive a phenomenological model for the fine structure of the ground electron and hole states in $[111]$-grown PbX, X=S,Se hexagonal and cylindrical nanowires. Projection of the tight-binding states to the basis of valley states enables the explicit parametrization of the valley mixing Hamiltonian, which is essential to obtain correct combinations of the valley states for electron (hole) ground levels analytically. The effective Hamiltonian of valley mixing allows to convert the intravalley components of the $g$-factors tensors to the Zeeman splittings of electron and hole levels in nanowires.Tensors of the intravalley electron (hole) Land\'e $g$-factors, parameters of the valley mixing Hamiltonian as well as the valley and anisotropic splitting energies and velocity matrix elements are also calculated.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the magnon-photon coupling in an open cavity magnonic system, which leads to two different nonreciprocal singularities dominated by the dissipative coupling. One type of singularity is the exceptional point, which is just on the exceptional surface in parameter space. The other type of singularity is the bound state in the continuum discovered in the level-attraction-like coupling, which is above the exceptional surface. In experiment, we realized the two different singularities with nonreciprocity and selectivity in an open cavity magnonic system with suitable dissipation rating. Our results can be understood well with the pseudo-Hermitian theory of magnon-polariton system.</description>

      <title>Emergent flat band and topological Kondo semimetal driven by orbital-selective correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands are expected to show proportionally enhanced electron correlations, which may generate a plethora of novel quantum phases and unusual low-energy excitations. They are increasingly being pursued in $d$-electron-based systems with crystalline lattices that feature destructive electronic interference, where they are often topological. Such flat bands, though, are generically located far away from the Fermi energy, which limits their capacity to partake in the low-energy physics. Here we show that electron correlations produce emergent flat bands that are pinned to the Fermi energy. We demonstrate this effect within a Hubbard model, in the regime described by Wannier orbitals where an effective Kondo description arises through orbital-selective Mott correlations. Moreover, the correlation effect cooperates with symmetry constraints to produce a topological Kondo semimetal. Our results motivate a novel design principle for Weyl Kondo semimetals in a new setting, viz. $d$-electron-based materials on suitable crystal lattices, and uncover interconnections among seemingly disparate systems that may inspire fresh understandings and realizations of correlated topological effects in quantum materials and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence (RF) of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak excitation. These properties are commonly explained disjoinedly as the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light, until a recent theory attributes anti-bunching to the laser-like spectrum's interference with the incoherently scattered light. However, the theory implies higher-order scattering processes, and led to an experiment purporting to validate an atom's simultaneous scattering of two photons. If true, it could complicate RF's prospects in quantum information applications. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all RF photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the RF's spectral and correlation properties. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, with the strongest effects measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole RF and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides novel understandings of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andreev bound states can occur at single impurities in superconductors if the impurities suppress superconductivity for a given system. In particular, well-known Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states occur at magnetic impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors. Here we demonstrate that nonmagnetic impurities in S/AF heterostructures with conventional intraband s-wave pairing also produce Andreev bound states. Analogously to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states the bound states in S/AF bilayers are spin split, but the spin of a particular bound state is determined by the sublattice to which the impurity belongs. The standard decay of the bound state LDOS is superimposed by atomic oscillations related to the staggered character of the exchange field in the host material and by another oscillating pattern produced by finite-momentum Neel triplet pairing generated at the impurity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological index of a one-dimensional topological p-wave superconductor can be revealed when driving with a classical vector potential i.e. an electromagnetic wave, through the quasiparticles inter-band transition rates. As a function of driving frequency $\omega$, it is possible to obtain a measure of this topological invariant from the resonance envelope classifying the two distinct topological phases of the short-range Kitaev wire. We also propose to probe the topological phase transition in the model through the responses of the global capacitance in the presence of the light field and also through the Josephson current between the wire and the proximity coupled bulk superconductor. The system may also be implemented on the Bloch sphere allowing alternative ways to measure the $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants through circuit or cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the electrical resistivity ($\rho$) and thermoelectric power (S) in a thin film of strained single-crystalline $\alpha$-Sn grown by molecular beam epitaxy on an insulating substrate. The temperature (T) dependence of the resistivity of $\alpha$-Sn can be divided into two regions:below T* $\approx$ 135 K $\rho$(T) shows a metallic-like behaviour, while above this temperature an increasing contribution from thermally excited holes to electrical transport is observed. However, it is still dominated by highly mobile electrons, resulting in a negative sign of the Seebeck coefficient above T = 47 K. In the presence of the magnetic field (B) applied along an electric field or thermal gradient, we note a negative magnetoresistance or a negative slope of S(B), respectively. The theoretical prediction for the former (calculated using density functional theory) agrees well with the experiment. However, these characteristics quickly disappear when the magnetic field is deviated from an orientation parallel to the electrical field or the thermal gradient. We indicate that the behaviour of the electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power can be explained in terms of the chiral current arising from the topologically non-trivial electronic structure of $\alpha$-Sn. Its decay at high temperature is a consequence of the decreasing ratio between the intervalley Weyl relaxation time to the Drude scattering time.</description>
