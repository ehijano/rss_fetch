      <title>Fast approximate solvers for metamaterials design in electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In electromagnetism, the model of Maxwell's equations yields accurate and trustworthy predictions. Numerical solvers can reach electromagnetic solutions far beyond the set of analytical closed-form solutions; this is crucial in metamaterials design where the goal is to find the geometry that generates an optimal electromagnetic solution for a desired property. Then why do we still need to create computational methodologies in metamaterials research? And why should we care about analytical models? The simulation and optimization bottlenecks limit the range of applications of the state of the art. Hence, there is room for opportunities to create new computational methodologies. Semi-analytical methods that are customized for classes of applications enable simulation and optimization. We detail the state of the research in customized methodologies using the illustrative example of optical metasurfaces and suggest best practices. We also discuss how machine learning may enhance these methodologies.</description>

      <title>Giant Second Harmonic Generation from 3R-MoS$_2$ Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have long served as a cornerstone technique to enhance nonlinear processes, enabling frequency conversion, efficient light manipulation and integrated photonic devices. However, traditional bulk materials often suffer from high absorption losses, hindering the second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency. Here, we develop a novel approach exploiting quasi-bound state in continuum (qBIC) to achieve giant SHG efficiency in metasurfaces utilizing 3R-MoS$_2$, with high index, superior damage threshold and inherent nonlinearity. The high refractive index of 3R-MoS$_2$, facilitates the high-quality factor (Q) metasurfaces, leading to reduced radiation leakage and localized light confinement within qBIC resonances, with which a remarkable 2000-fold enhancement in SHG intensity has been experimentally demonstrated. Additionally, the twist angle between the lattice orientation and the metasurface unit geometry exhibits a 120$^\circ$ periodicity in its influence on SHG behaviour. By strategically designing to realize the qBIC and exciton dual resonances and optimized twist angle (30$^\circ$), SHG conversion efficiency was boosted to ~1%, which is around 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of the best metasurfaces on traditional bulk materials. This approach enables potential applications in various areas of nonlinear optics, including frequency conversion, light manipulation, integrated photonics, and quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Thin-film superconducting NbTi microwave resonators for cryogenic thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators have recently gained a primary importance in the development of cryogenic applications, such as circuit quantum electrodynamics, electron spin resonance spectroscopy and particles detection for high-energy physics and astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the influence of the film thickness on the temperature response of microfabricated Nb50Ti50 superconducting resonators. S-shaped split ring resonators (S-SRRs), 20 nm to 150 nm thick, are designed to be electromagnetically coupled with standard Cu coplanar waveguides (CPWs) and their microwave properties are characterized at temperatures below 10 K. The combined contributions of the kinetic inductance LK(T) increase and the decreasing loaded quality factor QL induce an optimum condition on the temperature sensitivity and resolution of the resonators, for thinner films. A noise equivalent temperature (NET) as low as 0.5 uK/Hz^(1/2), at 1 Hz, is reported for 100 nm thick resonators at 4.2 K. We also asses the possibility of implementing a multiplexed frequency readout, allowing for the simultaneous temperature tracking of several sensors along a single CPW. Such results demonstrate the possibility to perform a distributed cryogenic temperature monitoring, with a sub-uK resolution. In such a perspective, superconducting S-SRRs, eventually benefiting from an even higher LK(T), might be exploited to accurately monitor the on-chip temperature of devices operating in cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>A multi-agentic framework for real-time, autonomous freeform metasurface design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation in nanophotonics currently relies on human experts who synergize specialized knowledge in photonics and coding with simulation and optimization algorithms, entailing design cycles that are time-consuming, computationally demanding, and frequently suboptimal. We introduce MetaChat, a multi-agentic design framework that can translate semantically described photonic design goals into high-performance, freeform device layouts in an automated, nearly real-time manner. Multi-step reasoning is enabled by our Agentic Iterative Monologue (AIM) paradigm, which coherently interfaces agents with code-based tools, other specialized agents, and human designers. Design acceleration is facilitated by Feature-wise Linear Modulation-conditioned Maxwell surrogate solvers that support the generalized evaluation of metasurface structures. We use freeform dielectric metasurfaces as a model system and demonstrate with MetaChat the design of multi-objective, multi-wavelength metasurfaces orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. These concepts present a scientific computing blueprint for utilizing specialist design agents, surrogate solvers, and human interactions to drive multi-physics innovation and discovery.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Efficient Atmospheric Plasma Jet Line Enabled by a Dielectric Microwave Anapole Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atmospheric pressure plasmas are crucial for applications in medicine, agriculture, and material processing, where their interaction with ambient air generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species for disinfection and treatment purposes. Additionally, their ability to alter carbon bonds makes them valuable for processing heat-sensitive materials and etching. Conventional resonant microwave plasma sources generate high electric fields for plasma production but are typically constrained to needle-like plasma configurations. Building on our earlier anapole plasma jet, we demonstrate a 2 cm line plasma jet for large-area surface treatment by leveraging the unique properties of the anapole source. With a uniform electric field of 106 V/m along the entire 2 cm length using just 1 W of input power, this highly efficient and compact PCB-compatible device enables stable plasma operation across a broad range of helium flow rates (1-40 slpm) and power levels (4-27 W). The anapole line plasma jet stands out for its high electron density, low operating temperature, and ease of frequency tunability, making it a promising platform for next-generation plasma applications.</description>

      <title>The First Hardware Demonstration of a Universal Programmable RRAM-based Probabilistic Computer for Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a critical computational strategy in drug design and discovery, but the complex diversity of biomolecular structures and flexible binding conformations create an enormous search space that challenges conventional computing methods. Although quantum computing holds promise for these challenges, it remains constrained by scalability, hardware limitations, and precision issues. Here, we report a prototype of a probabilistic computer (p-computer) that efficiently and accurately solves complex molecular docking for the first time, overcoming previously encountered challenges. At the core of the system is a p-computing chip based upon our artificial tunable probabilistic bits (p-bits), which are compatible with computing-in-memory schemes, based upon 180 nm CMOS technology and BEOL HfO2 RRAM. We successfully demonstrated the superior performance of the p-computer in practical ligand-protein docking scenarios. A 42-node molecular docking problem of lipoprotein with LolA-LolCDE complex-a key point in developing antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, was successfully solved. Our results align well with the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler tool. This work marks the first application of p-computing in molecular docking-based computational biology, which has great potential to overcome the limitations in success rate and efficiency of current technologies in addressing complex bioinformatics problems.</description>

      <title>X-ray photoemission spectrum, electronic structure, and magnetism of UCu$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The room temperature X-ray photoemission spectrum of the ferromagnetic compound UCu$_2$Si$_2$ (T$_C$ = 100 K) was measured using an Al K$_{\alpha}$ source. Related theoretical spectra were computed from densities of electronic states obtained in the local density approximation (LDA), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and using the GGA+U method. The calculated spectrum is in a good agreement with the experimental one. The spin polarized calculations based on the GGA+U approach as well as GGA/LSDA with orbital polarization (OP) corrections taken into account provide values of the total magnetic moment in reasonable agreement with the experimental values ranging between 1.6 and 2.0 $\mu_B$/U atom.</description>

      <title>2D semiconductors as on-chip light sources for integrated nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating on-chip light sources directly into nanophotonic waveguides generally requires introducing a different material to the chip than that used for guiding the light, a crucial step that requires dealing with several technical challenges, e.g., atomic lattice mismatch in epitaxial growth between substrate and luminescent materials resulting in strain defects that lower performance. Here we demonstrate that van der Waals materials, such as the 2D semiconductor MoSe2, can easily be transferred onto gold plasmonic nanowaveguides using standard dry visco-elastic polymer transfer techniques. We further show that the photoluminescence from MoSe2 can be injected directly into these on-chip waveguides. Our fabrication methods are compatible with large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques, highlighting a potential cost-effective and scalable hybrid plasmonic and 2D semiconductor platform for integrated nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Enhanced Unconventional Spin Current Anisotropy in a Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Growth of Highly Conductive PtSe2 Films Controlled by Raman Metrics for High-Frequency Photodetectors and Optoelectronic Mixers at 1.55 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional PtSe2 exhibits outstanding intrinsic properties such as high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, broadband absorption and air stability, making it ideal for (opto)electronic applications. However, achieving high crystalline quality films with controlled properties on low cost and insulating substrates remains challenging. Here, highly crystalline semimetallic PtSe2 films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. It is shown that a post-growth annealing remarkably improves the out-of-plane crystallinity of multilayer films and leads to the record film conductivity of 1.6 mS. In-depth structural analyses reveal the strong influence of the domain arrangement within the film on its electrical conductivity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the commonly used Eg Raman peak width, but also the A1g peak width, are both effective metrics for evaluating the quality of PtSe2: films with thinner Eg and A1g peaks exhibit higher in-plane and out-of-plane crystalline quality, as well as higher conductivity. Finally, coplanar waveguides integrating a semimetallic PtSe2 channel are fabricated on a 2-inch sapphire substrate to demonstrate optoelectronic devices operating at the 1.55 um telecom wavelength: photodetectors with a record bandwidth of 60 GHz and the first PtSe2-based optoelectronic mixer with a 30 GHz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>(Dis)continuous buckling transition in elastic shell mediated by contact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snap-buckling is a rapid shape transition in slender structures, appearing as a fundamental switching mechanism of natural and man-made systems. Boundary conditions of structures are crucial to predict and control their snap-buckling behavior. However, the general framework that relates boundary conditions, geometry, and performance of structures is still absent to date. Here, we study the snap-buckling of hemispherical shells in contact with rigid cylinders of different diameters to uncover the roles of boundary conditions in the dynamic performance of shells. Specifically, we analyze the jumping dynamics of the pneumatically inverted shells placed on the rigid cylinder by combining experiments and analytical theory. We find the characteristic diameter classifying the snap-buckling and jumping dynamics into two: (i)~if the diameter of the cylinder is sufficiently larger than the characteristic diameter, the shell is regarded as in contact with the infinitely large flat plate, (ii)~if not, the cylinder is regarded as a point. The analytical predictions for the jumping performance of the shell supplemented with the characteristic diameter are in excellent agreement with our experimental results. Our study clarifies that contact geometry is crucial in predicting the pathway of snap-buckling, indicating that the dynamic performance of soft robots would be optimized by tuning their surface geometry.</description>

      <title>Controlling magnetic damping with spintronic thermal effects in Py/Fe3O4-PANI bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experiments that control magnetic damping in Py/Fe3O4-PANI via two spintronic thermal effects: spin Seebeck and anomalous Nernst. Magnetic damping is measured using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) techniques, where the sample is excited by microwave radiation and the resulting DC voltage is detected in the Fe3O4-PANI film. When a temperature gradient is applied in the longitudinal configuration, the DC voltage linewidth increases or decreases depending on the direction of the thermal gradient. This finding demonstrates that magnetic damping in Py/Fe3O4-PANI can be controlled by currents induced by thermal effects. Remarkably, the absolute linewidth changes observed in Py/Fe3O4-PANI exceed those seen in bilayers of ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet and heavy metal by more than an order of magnitude. We interpret the significant change in magnetic damping as a result of intrinsic phenomena occurring in bilayers.</description>

      <title>Beyond 5 GHz excitation of a ZnO-based high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator on SiC substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reports on the fabrication and characterization of an Au/ZnO/Pt-based high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator (HBAR) on SiC substrates. We evaluate its microwave characteristics comparing with Si substrates for micro-electromechanical applications. Dielectric magnetron sputtering and an electron beam evaporator are employed to develop highly c-axis-oriented ZnO films and metal electrodes. The crystal structure and surface morphology of post-growth layers have been characterized using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. HBAR on SiC substrate results in multiple longitudinal bulk acoustic wave resonances up to 7 GHz, with the strongest excited resonances emerging at 5.25 GHz. The value of f.Q (Resonance frequency * Quality factor) parameter obtained using a novel Q approach method for HBAR on SiC substrate is 4.1 * 10^13 Hz, which to the best of our knowledge, is the highest among all reported values for specified ZnO-based devices.</description>

      <title>Percolation Effect Induced Significant Change of Complex Permittivity and Permeability for Silver-Epoxy Nano-Composites</title>

Abstract: The intricate interplay between complex permittivity and permeability constitutes the cornerstone of electromagnetic (EM) applications, enabling precise customization for various uses. This study employed silver-epoxy nano-composites to exemplify a conductor-insulator composite, leveraging silver's exceptional attributes, such as high conductivity and low reactivity. The determination of complex permittivity and permeability was conducted via the transmission/reflection method. At lower concentrations of dispersed silver particles, these nano-particles within the epoxy resin act as modest dipoles, augmenting permittivity. This regime aligns closely with the effective medium theory (EMT) and comprises the focus of much research. However, nearing the percolation threshold, a percolation effect emerges, drastically accelerating enhancement rates beyond the predictions of EMT. Simultaneously, long-wavelength electromagnetic waves induce diamagnetic currents within loops formed by metal grains. This diamagnetic effect intensifies with increasing volume fraction, leading to a reduction in permeability. This study observed percolation power law behavior near the threshold with calculated critical exponents. Consequently, the dielectric constant of the silver-epoxy nano-composite reached a maximum of 515. Regarding permeability, the lowest recorded value was 0.31. These findings were obtained within the X-band (8.2 GHz~12.4 GHz) region.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature, continuous-wave Terahertz generation in free-space with an intersubband mid-infrared photomixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a Terahertz photomixer pumped by mid-infrared photons at 10$\mu$m wavelength. The device is based on a dual-antenna architecture, in which a two-dimensional array of mid-infrared patch-antenna resonators is connected to the electrodes of a log-spiral Terahertz antenna. By exploiting intersubband absorption inside an AlGaAs-GaAs multi-quantum-well heterostructure, a photocurrent is coherently generated at the difference frequency between two quantum cascade lasers. The photocurrent drives the antenna electrodes allowing tunable, continuous-wave generation in free-space up to 1 Terahertz at room temperature. By experimentally studying the photomixer frequency response and dark impedance, we demonstrate that the observed power roll-off at high-frequency is limited by the combined effect of the photoexcited carrier's intrinsic lifetime and of the device $RC$ time constant. In the spectral range investigated we obtain, in continuous-wave, mid-infrared $\rightarrow$ Terahertz conversion efficiencies exceeding by orders of magnitude those of unipolar devices exploiting $\chi^{(2)}$ processes.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</description>
