      <title>To roll or not to roll(?) is the yield stress (in soft particulate gels)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is widely acknowledged that system-spanning particulate structures contribute to the observed yield stress and shear-thinning in attractive colloidal gels, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying microscopic mechanisms remains elusive. In this study, we present findings from coarse-grained simulations focusing on model depletion gels to shed light on this intriguing phenomenon. Contrary to conventional belief, our simulations reveal that the mere presence of attractive interactions and aggregate formation does not sufficiently explain the observed yield stress. Instead, we identify a crucial physics element in the form of microscopic constraints on the relative rotational motion between bonded particles. Through a detailed analysis of microstructure and particle dynamics, we elucidate how these constraints lead to the emergence of yield stress in soft particulate gels. This research provides essential insights into the micromechanical origins of yield stress in soft particulate gels, paving the way for improved understanding and engineering of these versatile materials for various real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of polymer viscosity by simultaneous ultrasonic and rheological measurements at high and varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thorough comprehension of the rheological behavior of polymers during industrial processes is essential for optimizing manufacturing efficiency and product quality. The final properties and behavior of resulting polymer parts are known to be directly linked to the thermomechanical evolution of materials during their processing. The non-invasive monitoring of this stage could improve the quality of manufactured equipment. This can be done by tracking viscosity off-line on a rheometer. In this article, an experimental method to monitor the viscosity of polymer materials at high and varying temperatures by using ultrasound is proposed. This method allows us to measure the ultrasonic and rheological properties of a sample, simultaneously and in real-time. An ultrasonic instrumentation is adapted to a rheometer for continuous monitoring. It allows high-temperature range measurements (up to 200{\deg}C). A dedicated signal processing algorithm is developed to determine the polymer longitudinal acoustic velocity by considering wave packet overlapping and temperature variation. Results on polyethylene show that ultrasonic parameters appear to be sensitive to changes in the polymer state. It enables more accurate detection of the onset of polymer crystallization. This study paves the way for ultrasonic real-time monitoring of the rotomolding process.</description>

      <title>Micellization of Diblock Copolymer Modified by Cononsolvency Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical micelle modified by cononsolvency effect is investigated by using self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and random phase approximation, which is formed by diblock copolymers consisted of one permanent hydrophobic block and one hydrophilic block. The addition of the cosolvent will bring about the cononsolvency effect on the hydrophilic block. The result shows that cononsolvency effect will expand the micelle size and changes the critical micelle concentration. By analyzing density profiles predicted by SCFT calculation, the micelle shell exhibits extension-collapse-extension transition with the addition of the cosolvent, which is responsible for the micelle size change. The driving force of the micellization is analyzed in the framework of SCFT calculation. The conventional micelle, which is formed by amphiphilic diblock copolymer in pure solvent, is compared with the micelle modified by cononsolvency effect. The reduction of the core-block - solvent contact area drives the formation of the conventional micelle. But in cononsolvency modified micelle, it is shown that the shell-block - cosolvent favorable interaction also plays the role to minimize the total free energy, whose mechanism is significantly different from that of the conventional micelle.</description>

      <title>CREASE-2D Analysis of Small Angle X-ray Scattering Data from Supramolecular Dipeptide Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend a recently developed machine-learning (ML) based CREASE-2D method to analyze the entire two-dimensional (2D) scattering pattern obtained from small angle X-ray scattering measurements of supramolecular dipeptide micellar systems. Traditional analysis of such scattering data would involve use of approximate or incorrect analytical models to fit to azimuthally-averaged 1D scattering patterns that can miss the anisotropic arrangements. Analysis of the 2D scattering profiles of such micellar solutions using CREASE-2D allows us to understand both isotropic and anisotropic structural arrangements that are present in these systems of assembled dipeptides in water and in the presence of added solvents/salts. CREASE-2D outputs distributions of relevant structural features including ones that cannot be identified with existing analytical models (e.g., assembled tubes, cross-sectional eccentricity, tortuosity, orientational order). The representative three-dimensional (3D) real-space structures for the optimized values of these structural features further facilitate visualization of the structures. Through this detailed interpretation of these 2D SAXS profiles we are able to characterize the shapes of the assembled tube structures as a function of dipeptide chemistry, solution conditions with varying salts and solvents, and relative concentrations of all components. This paper demonstrates how CREASE-2D analysis of entire SAXS profiles can provide an unprecedented level of understanding of structural arrangements which has not been possible through traditional analytical model fits to the 1D SAXS data.</description>

      <title>Observing the Glass and Jamming Transitions of Dense Granular Material in Microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates a weakly pulsed granular system of polystyrene spheres under long-time microgravity conditions on the International Space Station (ISS). The spheres are measured using Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) and are described by mean square displacements (MSDs). Our aim is to use this technique to show the first experimental evidence of glassy dynamics in dense granular media in microgravity and subsequently compare these results with ground-based measurements to see how the nature of these dynamics change without the influence of gravity. Our results show that as we densify the sample in microgravity, glassy dynamics appear at a volume fraction 1.6\% lower than on ground. We also show how the influence of gravity can affect how dense a granular system one can prepare by comparing the final jamming point of our sample on the ISS compared to our ground setup. We show that jamming occurs at a volume fraction 0.5\% lower in space compared to on ground. Showing that we can create denser states when a granular system is in the presence of a stronger gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Bacterial Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial assemblies exhibit rich collective behaviors that control their biological functions, making them a relevant object of study from an active matter physics perspective. Dense bacterial suspensions self-organize into distinct physical phases with intriguing dynamical properties. Here, we study dense two-dimensional films of swimming bacteria using advanced imaging techniques and machine learning. By varying density, we uncover a bacterial glass transition, a direct active matter analogue of equilibrium glass transitions in colloidal and molecular fluids. The transition is marked by a dramatic slowdown of dynamics with minimal structural change. Strong dynamic heterogeneity emerges in space and time, leading to an anomalous violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation and a growing dynamic correlation length, universally observed across five bacterial strains. Our results establish that bacterial colonies exhibit glassy dynamics, but their living, active nature gives them unique properties, paving the way for new research regarding how non-equilibrium physics impacts biology.</description>

      <title>On the influence of electrolytic gradient orientation on phoretic transport in dead-end pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrolytic diffusiophoresis refers to directional migration of colloids due to interfacial forces that develop in response to local electrolytic concentration ($c$) gradients. This physicochemical transport provides an efficient alternative in numerous microscale applications where advection-induced transport is infeasible. Phoretic withdrawal and injection in dead-end pores can be controlled by orienting salt gradients into or out of the pore; however, the extent to which this orientation influences spatiotemporal transport patterns is not thoroughly explored. In this study, we find that it has a significant influence: colloidal withdrawal in solute-out mode ($\beta=c_\infty/c_{\text{pore}}&lt;1$) is faster and shallower, whereas the solute-in mode enables deeper withdrawal. Similarly, solute-out injection features rapidly propagating wavefronts, whereas the solute-in mode ($\beta &gt;1$) promotes uniform and gradual injection. Each mode's transport is found to evolve and persist over different time scales. We characterize the performance of these modes and find that while persistence of the solute-out mode strengthens with a growing electrolytic gradient [$\sim \ln(\beta^{-0.4})$], solute-in mode diminishes and eventually its persistence is insensitive to $\beta$. We also incorporate the variable mobility model to examine the impact of large zeta potentials, which intensifies the transport of solute-out mode further and weakens the solute-in mode. Additionally, we investigate how osmotic flows of the two modes affect injection and withdrawal patterns. We find that osmosis-induced mixing can counterintuitively inhibit injection effectiveness in solute-out mode. These insights bring attention to the distinctions between different phoretic transport modes and contribute to the rational design and setup of electrolytic gradients in numerous microscale applications.</description>

      <title>Topology and Kinetic Pathways of Colloidosome Assembly and Disassembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid shells, such as lipid vesicles and soap bubbles, are ubiquitous throughout biology, engineered matter, and everyday life. Their creation and disintegration are defined by a singularity that separates a topologically distinct extended liquid film from a boundary-free closed shell. Such topology-changing processes are essential for cellular transport and drug delivery. However, their studies are challenging because of the rapid dynamics and small length scale of conventional lipid vesicles. We develop fluid colloidosomes, micron-sized analogs of lipid vesicles. We study their stability close to their disk-to-sphere topological transition. Intrinsic colloidal length and time scales slow down the dynamics to reveal vesicle conformations in real time during their assembly and disassembly. Remarkably, the lowest-energy pathway by which a closed vesicle transforms into a disk involves a topologically distinct cylinder-like intermediate. These results reveal universal aspects of topological changes in all liquid shells and a robust platform for the encapsulation, transport, and delivery of nanosized cargoes.</description>

      <title>Self-alignment and anti-self-alignment suppress motility-induced phase separation in active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the impact of self-alignment and anti-self-alignment on collective phenomena in dense active matter. These mechanisms correspond to effective torques that align or anti-align a particles orientation with its velocity, as observed in active granular systems. In the context of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) - a non-equilibrium coexistence between a dense clustered phase and a dilute homogeneous phase - both self- and anti-self-alignment are found to suppress clustering. Specifically, increasing self-alignment strength first leads to flocking within the dense cluster, and eventually to the emergence of a homogeneous flocking phase. In contrast, anti-self-alignment induces a freezing phenomenon, progressively reducing particle speed until MIPS is suppressed and a homogeneous phase is recovered. These results are supported by scaling arguments and are amenable to experimental verification in high-density active granular systems exhibiting self- or anti-self-alignment.</description>

      <title>Competing effect of disorder on phase separation in active systems: from facilitated to hindered growth and rough interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of random pinned disorder on a collection of self propelled particles. To achieve this, we construct a continuum model by formulating the coupled hydrodynamic equations for slow variables i.e, local density and momentum density of particles. The disorder in the system acts as pinning sites, effectively immobilizing the particles that come into contact with them. Our numerical results reveal that weak disorder leads to phase separation in the system at density and activity lower than the typical values for motility induced phase separation. We construct a phase diagram using numerical simulations as well as linearized approximation in the plane of activity and packing fraction of particles at weak disorder densities. As disorder densities rise in the system, kinetic processes slow down, while at high disorder densities, the system becomes heterogeneous and eventually undergoes kinetic arrest. The structure factor tail deviates from Porods law, indicating increased roughness at domain interfaces under strong disorder. Furthermore, we analyze the fractal dimension of the interface as a function of disorder density, highlighting the increasing irregularity of phase separated domains.</description>

      <title>X-ray particle tracking velocimetry for rheological characterization: Application to material extrusion additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method to quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological quantities of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament fabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles embedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through an aluminum nozzle in a custom-designed experimental setup, based on commercial designs. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations from classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and non-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine the local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced non-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions, reflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. Our findings demonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and rheological properties, underscoring its potential as a future tool for investigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial processing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported application of XPTV in polymer melt rheology, offering a new approach to address measurement challenges previously inaccessible to conventional optical methods.</description>

      <title>Palatable pellets -- a fundamental framework to produce sustainable pellets via extrusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pellet manufacturing various ingredients in powder or particle form are pressed together into a dense product, a pellet, with better nutritional, calorific, and handling properties than the individual input ingredients themselves. For this reason, pellet manufacturing is applied to up-convert industrial co-products from various sectors like agriculture, forestry, human food, or bio-energy production, to valorize their waste-streams into more valuable products. However, processing such diverse ingredient streams presents an industrial challenge and raises the important scientific question: "Under which process conditions do loose pellet ingredients bind together to form a mechanically rigid and durable pellet?" In this work we provide new answers to this old research question by determining the causal relationships between processing parameters and physical pellet quality. Systematic pelleting experiments reveal that the interplay of typical process parameters such as steam conditioning temperature, production rate, and die geometry, can be understood in an overarching framework of process interactions. We introduce the concept of the "stickiness temperature," $\mathrm{T^*}$, marking the onset of critical enthalpic reactions necessary for pellet agglomeration, the boundary condition for bond formation within a pellet. Our framework demonstrates how $T^*$ is achieved through a combination of steam conditioning and friction, and how these conditions can be controlled by adjusting process parameters. Our findings underscore the significance of pellet temperature in conjunction with die residence time, for optimizing physical pellet quality while reducing energy consumption per kilogram of product. Validating our results in a trial and leveraging existing literature data, our framework provides handles to intelligently enhance the efficiency and sustainability of pelleting processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating magnetic field is an efficient method of actuation of synthetic colloids in liquids. In this Letter we theoretically study the effect of the thermal noise on torque-driven steering of magnetic nanohelices. Using a combination of numerical and analytical methods, we demonstrate that surprisingly a weak thermal noise can substantially disrupt the orientation and rotation of the nanohelix, severely impeding its propulsion. The results of Langevin simulations are in excellent agreement with the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation and the analytical effective field approximation.</description>

      <title>IEC-Independent Coupling Between Water Uptake and Ionic Conductivity in Anion-Conducting Polymer Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are promising candidates for replacing proton exchange membranes (PEMs) in electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries, and osmotic energy extraction systems. However, optimizing the AEM design requires a deeper understanding of the ionic conduction mechanism in the hydrated polymer matrix. This study investigates this mechanism by seeking to understand the relationship between ion exchange capacity (IEC), water absorption, and ionic conductivity in polynorbornene-based thin films. We combine experimental measurements with computational simulations using a newly developed minimal model of the polymer film. Our model is able to reproduce key experimental observations, including water sorption isotherms and ion conduction behavior as a function of relative humidity, and successfully captures the relationship between them. By comparing experimental data with computational results, we explain the commonly reported correlation between conductivity and hydration level and show how the correlation between these variables is affected by the charge density and temperature of the material. Our research advances our understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern the performance of the polyelectrolyte membrane, which is essential for the development of more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Screening properties of charge regulated zwitterionic macroion solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a calculation scheme for obtaining the screening length in electrolytes and zwitterionic macroions subject to charge regulation by the former. We express the inverse screening parameter in terms of the derivative of the pressure with respect to the chemical potential by bypassing the solution of the PB equation. The screening parameter consists of two parts. The first part is composed of the Debye length evaluated with effective charges of the ions and the macroions, and the second term corresponds to the macroion surface dissociation equilibrium that shows an interesting screening resonance behavior. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of local variables on screening and show that the CR macroions themselves provide a screening mechanism despite the low concentration of free ions. Our findings may shed new light on proteins, protein-membrane, and charged nanoparticles with dissociable surface groups in their bathing solution.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoders understand knot topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning (ML) methods are emerging as valid alternatives to standard mathematical methods for identifying knots in long, collapsed polymers. Here, we introduce a hybrid supervised/unsupervised ML approach for knot classification based on a variational autoencoder enhanced with a knot type classifier (VAEC). The neat organization of knots in its latent representation suggests that the VAEC, only based on an arbitrary labeling of three-dimensional configurations, has grasped complex topological concepts such as chirality, unknotting number, braid index, and the grouping in families such as achiral, torus, and twist knots. The understanding of topological concepts is confirmed by the ability of the VAEC to distinguish the chirality of knots $9_{42}$ and $10_{71}$ not used for its training and with a notoriously undetected chirality to standard tools. The well-organized latent space is also key for generating configurations with the decoder that reliably preserves the topology of the input ones. Our findings demonstrate the ability of a hybrid supervised-generative ML algorithm to capture different topological features of entangled filaments and to exploit this knowledge to faithfully reconstruct or produce new knotted configurations without simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Hard Spheres in the Fluid, Crystalline, and Glassy Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response of a system of hard spheres to two classes of perturbations over a range of densities spanning the fluid, crystalline, and glassy regimes within a molecular dynamics framework. Firstly, we consider the relaxation of a "thermal inhomogeneity," in which a central region of particles is given a higher temperature than its surroundings and is then allowed to evolve under Newtonian dynamics. In this case, the hot central "core" of particles expands and collides with the cold surrounding material, creating a transient radially-expanding "compression wave," which is rapidly dissipated by particle-particle collisions and interaction with periodic images at the boundary, leading to a rapid relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we consider a rapid compression of the spheres into a disordered glassy state at high densities. Such rapidly compressed systems exhibit very slow structural relaxation times, many orders of magnitude longer than thermalization times for simple temperature inhomogeneities. We find that thermal relaxation of the velocity distribution is determined simply by the total collision rate, whereas structural relaxation requires coordinated collective motion, which is strongly suppressed at high density, although some particle rearrangement nevertheless occurs. We further find that collisions propagate significantly faster through glassy systems than through crystalline systems at the same density, which leads to very rapid relaxation of velocity perturbations, although structural relaxation remains very slow. These results extend the validity of previous observations that glassy systems exhibit a hybrid character, sharing features with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we introduce the hard sphere causal graph, a network-based characterization of the dynamical history of a hard sphere system, which encapsulates several useful...</description>

      <title>Aggregation in Dilute Aqueous Solutions of Hydroxypropyl Cellulose with Salt Ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal behaviors of hydroxypropyl cellulose dilute aqueous solutions with impurities of Group~I alkali metal ions (Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs chlorides) has been studied by means of static and dynamic light scattering measurements. From the experimental data, it follows that at temperatures above the LCST and in the presence of salts, there arise supramolecular associates (clusters) that are several times larger than the wavelength of visible light. It is shown that the observed intensity of backscattered light is described by the tangent plane approximation and the Mie scattering theory. An approach is proposed to model the hydrophobic association of polymer molecules in solutions with salt ions. A parameter driving the interfacial energy density at the polymer-solvent interface is introduced into the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which describes the temporal evolution of the polymer concentration in a given point of space. In this way, the presence of electrolytes in solution is modeled. It follows from the results of computer simulation that an increase in the interfacial energy density (strengthening of hydrophobic interactions) leads to an increase in the size of polymer aggregates.</description>

      <title>Chemical control of self-assembly by the electrosolvation force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembly of matter in solution generally relies on attractive interactions that overcome entropy and drive the formation of higher-order molecular and particulate structures. Such interactions play key roles in a variety of contexts, e.g., crystallisation, biomolecular folding and condensation, pathological protein aggregation, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. The electrosolvation force entails a new conceptual paradigm in the known palette of interactions that drive the spontaneous accretion and organisation of matter. However, an understanding of the underlying physical chemistry, and therefore the ability to exert control over and tune the interaction, remains incomplete. Here we demonstrate that this force arises from the structure of the interfacial electrolyte. Neutral molecules such as a different solvent, osmolytes or surfactants, can - even at very low concentrations in the medium - disrupt or reinforce pre-existing interfacial solvent structure, thereby furnishing unanticipated chemical tuning of the ability of matter to self-assemble. The observations further present unexpected mechanistic elements that may explain the impact of co-solvents and osmolytes on protein structure, stability and pathological protein condensation. Our findings shed new light on microscopic mechanisms that drive the emergence of order and structure from molecular to macroscopic scales in the solution phase.</description>

      <title>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck information swimmers with external and internal feedback controls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an underdamped active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle, we propose two information swimmer models having either external or internal feedback control and perform their numerical simulations. Depending on the velocity that is measured after every fixed time interval (measurement time), the friction coefficient is modified in the externally controlled model, whereas the persistence time for the activity is changed in the internally controlled one. In the steady state, both of these information swimmers acquire finite average velocities in the noisy environment, and the efficiency can be maximized by tuning the measurement time. The internally controlled swimmer can generally achieve a larger velocity and efficiency than the externally controlled one when the active fluctuation is large.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Design of Floppy Modes and Frustrated Loops in Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metamaterials are a promising platform for a range of applications, from shock absorption to mechanical computing. These functionalities typically rely on floppy modes or mechanically frustrated loops, both of which are difficult to design. We introduce a combinatorial approach that allows to create an arbitrarily large number of floppy modes and frustrated loops. The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling, and we utilize our combinatorial floppy chains and frustrated loops to achieve matrix-vector multiplication in materia. Our findings bring about new principles for the design and the use of floppiness and geometric frustration in soft matter and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Classification of Supercooled Liquids: Critical Cooling Rates and Entropic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate supercooled liquids formed at cooling rates below and above the critical cooling rate (CCR). By analyzing the distribution of short-time averaged potential energies (DoPE) and crystallization behaviors, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes in supercooled liquids: the glass-forming regime (GFR) and the crystal-forming regime (CFR). For systems cooled below CCR (CFR), the DoPE exhibits a sharp peak, indicative of reduced configurational entropy. In contrast, liquids cooled above CCR (GFR) display a broad DoPE distribution, reflecting higher configurational entropy. These findings establish a robust classification framework for supercooled liquids. Further analysis reveals a crossover temperature (T_x) in both regimes, consistent with the freezing temperature (T_f). Near T_x, crystallization barrier-temperature relationships exhibit abrupt changes. Below T_x, CFR crystallizes marginally faster than GFR, whereas above T_x, the influence of cooling rates on crystallization rates diminishes. These results further categorize GFR and CFR into high and low-temperature sub-regimes, highlighting the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical woven fibrillar structures in developing single gyroids in butterflies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nature offers a remarkable diversity of nanomaterials that have extraordinary functional and structural properties. Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the Gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green colour. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris, develop as woven fibrillar structures, disputing the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibres, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue colouration. Our findings not only introduce a fundamentally new variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of prototypical models for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids, including size-asymmetric and multivalent systems. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. Here we introduce a general stochastic dynamics model for these cases, namely a chiral active particle with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque, which implies a finite correlation time for internal noise. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. We finally provide an experimental example by analyzing imaging data for malaria parasites that glide through hydrogels on helical trajectories.</description>
