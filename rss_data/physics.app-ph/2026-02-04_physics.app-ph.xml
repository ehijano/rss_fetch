      <title>A bulk acoustic resonator with vertical electrodes for wideband filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiofrequency (RF) front ends for current and next generation (5G and 6G) wireless communication demand acoustic filters that combine wide bandwidth, high power capability, and thermal stability. Existing surface and bulk acoustic wave (SAW and BAW) technologies face inherent trade-offs between electromechanical coupling, lithographic tunability, and robustness. Here we introduce the bulk acoustic resonator with vertical electrodes (VBAR), a device that combines the advantages of suspended and solidly mounted resonators. VBARs use lithium niobate (LiNbO3) ridges with sidewall electrodes to excite a shear-horizontal bulk acoustic resonance, providing frequency control through lithography in a configuration that is mechanically anchored to the substrate. Fabricated VBARs exhibit electromechanical coupling coefficients exceeding 30% in the 2-4 GHz range, enabling ladder filters with fractional bandwidths of nearly 20%. While further optimization is necessary to minimize losses, the VBAR concept offers an alternative route toward wideband and robust RF filters for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Loss mechanisms of microwave frequency acoustic waves in thin film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a versatile platform for phononic and photonic devices with applications ranging from classical signal processing to quantum technologies. However, acoustic loss fundamentally limits the performance of acoustic devices on TFLN platforms, yet its physical origin remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate acoustic propagation loss in various TFLN platforms, including lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI), lithium niobate on sapphire (LNOS), suspended LN thin films, and bulk LN at gigahertz frequencies over temperatures ranging from 4 K to above room temperature. Using a delay-line method, we extract frequency- and temperature-dependent losses for Rayleigh, shear-horizontal, and Lamb modes. We observe an anomalous non-monotonic temperature dependence in LNOI that closely resembles acoustic loss in amorphous materials, indicating a dominant loss channel associated with the buried oxide layer at low temperatures. At elevated temperatures, the loss converges to the Akhiezer damping governed by phonon-phonon interactions. High-resolution electron microscopy further reveals nanoscale interfacial crystal impurities that may contribute to the increased acoustic loss in TFLN platforms relative to bulk LN. These results elucidate the acoustic loss mechanisms in TFLN and provide guidelines for designing low-loss acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Learning of the Wave Speed Landscape in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave velocity is a key parameter for imaging complex media, but in vivo measurements are typically limited to reflection geometries, where only backscattered waves from short-scale heterogeneities are accessible. As a result, conventional reflection imaging fails to recover large-scale variations of the wave velocity landscape. Here we show that matrix imaging overcomes this limitation by exploiting the quality of wave focusing as an intrinsic guide star. We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Optimization of Detector-Grade Yield in High-Purity Germanium Crystal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-purity germanium (HPGe) crystals underpin some of the most sensitive detectors used in fundamental physics and other high-resolution radiation-sensing applications. Despite their importance, the supply of detector-grade HPGe remains limited because achieving high yield in Czochralski growth (CZ) depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear processes, impurity incorporation, thermal gradients, and dynamic control settings that are largely mastered by only a handful of companies with decades of experience. Here we present a data-driven prediction framework based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network with multi-head attention, trained on time-resolved growth parameters (e.g., heater power, pull rate, and impurity indicators) from 48 independent crystal runs. The model predicts the final detector-grade fraction for each growth and, using SHAP feature-importance analysis, identifies impurity concentration and growth rate as the dominant factors governing yield, consistent with empirical understanding. By providing a quantitative, interpretable link between in-process signals and post-growth detector quality, this framework offers a practical path toward improving yield, reducing dependence on trial-and-error tuning, and scaling HPGe production for next-generation rare-event detectors.</description>

      <title>Universal reconstructive polarimetry with graphene-metal infrared photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of light polarization has long been based on complex, bulk, and slow optical instruments. The advent of materials with in-situ variable polarization photoresponse has led to the concept of reconstructive polarimetry, where the detector itself plays the role of tunable polarizer. Materials enabling such functionality have been limited to complex van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate the reconstructive polarimetry with infrared (IR) detectors based on simple gated graphene-metal junctions. The reconstruction exploits the gate tuning of polarization contrast, which enables the evaluation of both infrared power and polarization angle from photovoltage measurements at two sequential gate voltages. The physics enabling the polarimetry lies in polarization-dependent shift of the electron hot spot near the contact, and the gate tuning of the of light-sensitive barrier width. We further show the universality of polarization reconstruction, i.e. its feasibility with different geometries of the junction, and with graphene of different quality, from hBN-encapsulated to the scalable vapor-deposited wet-transferred samples.</description>

      <title>Switching Characteristics of Electrically Connected Stochastically Actuated Magnetic Tunnel Junction Nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic dynamics of nanoscale perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs) and the correlations that arise when they are electrically coupled. Individual junctions exhibit thermally activated spin-transfer torque switching with transition probabilities that are well described by a Poisson process. When two junctions are connected in parallel, circuit-mediated redistribution of voltages that occurs in real time as the junction resistances change leads to correlated switching behavior. A minimal stochastic model based on single-junction statistical switching properties and Kirchhoff's laws captures the coupled switching probabilities, while a Markov-chain formalism describes nonequilibrium steady states under multi-pulse driving. Further, these circuit-mediated interactions can be mapped onto the parameters of an Ising Hamiltonian, providing an interpretation in terms of effective spin-spin interactions. Our results demonstrate how simple electrical connections can generate Ising-like couplings and tunable stochastic dynamics in nanoscale magnets.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically DRC-Compliant Nanophotonic Design via Learned Generative Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design has enabled the systematic design of ultra-compact and high-performance nanophotonic components. Yet enforcing foundry design rules during inverse design remains a major challenge, as optimized devices frequently violate constraints on minimum feature size and spacing. Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>A thin and soft optical tactile sensor for highly sensitive object perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial in robotics and wearable devices for safe perception and interaction with the environment. Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution. However, existing optical approaches, particularly vision-based tactile sensors, rely on complex optical assemblies that involve lenses and cameras, resulting in bulky, rigid, and alignment-sensitive designs. In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles. The proposed speckle-based approach provides a compact, easily fabricated, and mechanically compliant platform that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel tactile-sensing paradigm for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Synthetic topological device for advancing elastic energy harvesting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-efficiency energy harvesting of ultrasonic elastic waves are crucial for powering electric gadgets in many emerging technologies such as wearable devices, wireless sensing, and biomedical implants. Although topological phononic metamaterials have recently been demonstrated as a promising paradigm for confining and guiding elastic waves through robust bound states, achieving ultrahigh-Q topological resonance with enhanced energy conversion efficiency remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a synthetic-dimensional higher-order topological insulator by engineering the flexural bands of elastic metamaterials, featuring highly localized topological hinge states in the bulk bands. This topological hinge mode stems from the nonzero combination of the bulk polarization and the Chern number in the synthetic-dimensional band structure, thus giving rise to a strong elastic-to-electric energy conversion at the corner of the phononic plate. Through numerical simulations and experimental validations, straightforward evidence of the localized modes with robust protection and consequent abilities in activating the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) array have been demonstrated. Our findings open a new avenue for topological-physics-enabled ultrasonic devices and present promising prospects for applications in weak-signal detection and self-powered sensors.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale spin-wave frequency-selective limiter for 5G technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power limiters are essential devices in modern radio frequency (RF) communications systems to protect highly sensitive input channels from large incoming signals. Nowadays-used semiconductor limiters suffer from high electronic noise and switching delays when approaching the GHz range, which is crucial for the modern generation of 5G communication technologies aiming to operate at the EU 5G high band (24.25-27.5 GHz). The proposed solution is to use ferrite-based Frequency Selective Limiters (FSLs), which maintain their efficiency at high GHz frequencies, although they have only been studied at the macroscale so far. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept of nanoscale FSLs. The devices are based on spin-wave transmission affected by four-magnon scattering phenomena in a 97-nm-thin Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film. Spin waves were excited and detected using coplanar waveguide (CPW) transducers of the smallest feature size of 250 nm. The FSLs are tested in the frequency range up to 25 GHz, and the key parameters are extracted (power threshold, power limiting level, insertion losses, bandwidth) for different spin-wave modes and transducer lengths. An analytical theory has been formulated to describe the fundamental physical processes, and a numerical model has been developed to quantitatively describe the insertion losses and power characteristics of the FSLs. Additionally, the perspective of the spin-wave devices is discussed, including the possibility of simultaneously integrating three devices into one: a frequency-selective limiter, an RF filter, and a delay line, allowing for more efficient use of space and energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems use neural circuits to integrate input information and produce outputs. Synaptic convergence, where multiple neurons converge their inputs onto a single downstream neuron, is common in natural neural circuits. However, understanding specific computations performed by such neural blocks and implementating them in hardware requires further research. This work focuses on synaptic convergence in a simplified circuit of three spiking artificial neurons based on diffusive memristors. Numerical modelling and experiments reveal input voltage combinations that enable targeted activation of spiking for specific neuron configurations. We analyse the statistical characteristics of spiking patterns and interpret them from a computational perspective. The numerical simulations match experimental measurements. Our findings contribute to development of universal functional blocks for neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance Training-Free Pipeline for Robust Random Telegraph Signal Characterization via Adaptive Wavelet-Based Denoising and Bayesian Digitization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random telegraph signal (RTS) analysis is increasingly important for characterizing meaningful temporal fluctuations in physical, chemical, and biological systems. The simplest RTS arises from discrete stochastic switching events between two binary states, quantified by their transition amplitude and dwell times in each state. Quantitative analysis of RTSs provides valuable insights into microscopic processes such as charge trapping in semiconductors. However, analyzing RTS becomes considerably complex when signals exhibit multi-level structures or are corrupted by background white or pink noise. To address these challenges and support high-throughput RTS characterization, we propose a modular, training-free signal processing pipeline that integrates adaptive dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) denoising with a lightweight Bayesian digitization strategy. The adaptive DTCWT denoiser incorporates autonomous parameter selection rules for its decomposition level and thresholds, optimizing white noise suppression without manual tuning. Our Bayesian digitizer formulates RTS level assignment as a probabilistic latent-state inference problem incorporating temporal regularization without iterative optimization, effectively resolving binary trap states even under residual notorious background pink noise. Quantitative benchmarking on large synthetic datasets with known ground truth demonstrates improved RTS reconstruction accuracy, trap-state resolution, and dwell-time estimation across diverse noise regimes and multi-trap scenarios, while achieving up to 83x speedups over classical and neural baselines. Qualitative validation on experimental RTS data when no ground truth is available illustrates practical usability and flexibility for real-time or large-scale analysis in real measurement settings.</description>

      <title>The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the hot-electron-limit (HEL) closure for the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, known as the gyromoment (GM) approach. By expanding the gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio limit, {\tau} = Ti/Te &lt;&lt; 1, and retaining only the essential O({\tau}) terms, we obtain a closed system for the density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In a Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with the HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low collisionality dynamics. An extension to the tokamak-relevant s-{\alpha} geometry and a comparison with gyrokinetic simulations reveal the capabilities and limitations of the HEL-closed GM model: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at {\tau}=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents an accurate prediction of the Dimits shift and of transport suppression.</description>

Abstract: Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak \`{a} Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Implementation of transformer-based LLMs with large-scale optoelectronic neurons on a CMOS compatible platform</title>

Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only 40 nm CMOS process node, orchestrated by an optoelectronic version of systolic array with no data skew and negligible propagation delay, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description>
