      <title>Birkhoff sections in 3-manifold with invariant toric foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for directly constructing Birkhoff sections on 3-manifolds foliated by invariant tori. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for various types of periodic orbits to serve as boundary orbits of a Birkhoff section. Our construction is applied to the boundaries of toric domains and the energy hypersurfaces of separable Hamiltonian systems, providing explicit conditions for the existence or non-existence of different types of Birkhoff sections.</description>

      <title>Categorical Lyapunov Theory I: Stability of Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a fundamental characterization of the stability of dynamical systems. This paper presents a categorical framework for Lyapunov theory, generalizing stability analysis with Lyapunov functions categorically. Core to our approach is the set of axioms underlying a setting for stability, which give the necessary ingredients for ``doing Lyapunov theory'' in a category of interest. With these minimal assumptions, we define the stability of equilibria, formulate Lyapunov morphisms, and demonstrate that the existence of Lyapunov morphisms is necessary and sufficient for establishing the stability of flows. To illustrate these constructions, we show how classical notions of stability, e.g., for continuous and discrete time dynamical systems, are captured by this categorical framework for Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we illustrate how enriched categories, e.g., Lawvere metric spaces, yield settings for stability enabling one to ``do Lyapunov theory'' in enriched categories.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov function for a Synchronisation diffeomorphism of three clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyapunov functions are essential tools in dynamical systems, as they allow the stability analysis of equilibrium points without the need to explicitly solve the system's equations. Despite their importance, no systematic method exists for constructing Lyapunov functions. In a previous paper, we examined a diffeomorphism arising from the problem of Huygens Synchronisation for three identical limit cycle clocks arranged in a line, proving that the system possesses a unique asymptotically stable fixed point on the torus T2, corresponding to synchronisation in phase opposition. In this paper, we re-derive this result by constructing a discrete Lyapunov function for the system. The closure of the basin of attraction of the asymptotically stable attractor is the torus T2, showing that Huygens Synchronisation exhibits generic and robust behaviour, occurring with probability one with respect to initial conditions.</description>

      <title>A Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem for Repeated Bistochastic Quantum Interactions with Applications to Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider compositions of random bistochastic completely positive (bcp) maps driven by an ergodic dynamical system. Our main result is the explicit description of Oseledets's Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) for such compositions in terms of the random multiplicative domains corresponding to the random bcp maps in the compositions. By applying our main theorem, we classify when compositions of random bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, and use this classification to show that occasionally PPT maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, i.e., if compositions of random bcp maps contain PPT bcp maps with positive probability, then they are asymptotically entanglement breaking almost surely. We then strengthen our results in the case of compositions of i.i.d. random bcp maps, and, by an application of the theory of random walks on linear groups, we prove a generalization of a theorem of Kuperberg for compositions of i.i.d. random bcp maps. We conclude with a cursory discussion of how to use our methods to move beyond asymptotics and find random finite times at which compositions of random bcp maps are entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>Bushfires and Balance: Proactive versus Reactive Policies in Prescribed Burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model to describe the interplay between prescribed burning and bushfires based on a system of ordinary differential equations.
  We show that the system possesses a unique steady-state, whose stability depends on the policy governing prescribed burning. Specifically, a Reactive Policy in which prescribed burning activities are increased in response to bushfire events risks to produce instability and requires an additional feedback control, while a Proactive Policy in which moderate prescribed burning replaces natural bushfires may be more effective to maintain a balanced state. A high regeneration factor is also helpful to ensuring the stability of the equilibrium state.
  The results presented here should not be regarded as a definitive solution to the issue of prescribed burning, as numerous specific factors must be considered in any comprehensive policymaking approach. Nonetheless, the stability analysis developed in this paper suggests that policies driven primarily by reactive responses to bushfire events may be emotionally charged and prone to instability. These reactive policies would benefit from incorporating feedback control mechanisms. In contrast, strategies based on proactive prescribed burning in moderate quantities, focused on prevention rather than reaction, are likely to be more effective in maintaining long-term ecological stability.</description>

      <title>A note on spectral properties of random $S$-adic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with random $S$-adic systems arising from an i.i.d. sequence of unimodular substitutions. Using equidistribution results of Benoist and Quint, we show in Theorem 3.3 that, under some natural assumptions, if the Lyapunov exponent of the spectral cocycle is strictly less that 1/2 of the Lyapunov exponent of the random walk on $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ driven by the sequence of substitution matrices, then almost surely the spectrum of the $S$-adic $\mathbb{Z}$-action is singular with respect to any (fixed in advance) continuous measure. Finally, the appendix discusses the weak-mixing property for random $S$-adic systems associated to the family of substitutions introduced in Example 4.1.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI and the Scientific Method: Interpretability-Guided Knowledge Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scientific method is the cornerstone of human progress across all branches of the natural and applied sciences, from understanding the human body to explaining how the universe works. The scientific method is based on identifying systematic rules or principles that describe the phenomenon of interest in a reproducible way that can be validated through experimental evidence. In the era of generative artificial intelligence, there are discussions on how AI systems may discover new knowledge. We argue that human complex reasoning for scientific discovery remains of vital importance, at least before the advent of artificial general intelligence. Yet, AI can be leveraged for scientific discovery via explainable AI. More specifically, knowing the `principles' the AI systems used to make decisions can be a point of contact with domain experts and scientists, that can lead to divergent or convergent views on a given scientific problem. Divergent views may spark further scientific investigations leading to interpretability-guided explanations (IGEs), and possibly to new scientific knowledge. We define this field as Explainable AI for Science, where domain experts -- potentially assisted by generative AI -- formulate scientific hypotheses and explanations based on the interpretability of a predictive AI system.</description>

      <title>Harnessing omnipresent oscillator networks as computational resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory behavior. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This reservoir computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. This work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.</description>
