      <title>On the existence of solutions to the multi-species Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spatially homogeneous Landau equation for multiple species with different masses. As in the single-species case, the singularity of the collision operator is determined by a parameter $\gamma \in [-3,1]$, where $\gamma = -3$ corresponds to Coulomb interactions. We prove that if $\gamma\geq -\sqrt{8}$ in the cross-interaction operators, then there exists a natural multi-species generalization of the Fisher information which is a Lyapunov functional for the multi-species Landau system. On the other hand, we give a counterexample showing that the Fisher information is in general no longer a Lyapunov functional below the threshold $(\gamma &lt; - \sqrt{8})$ for the two-species system if one species has infinite mass. However, we are able to provide a new method to show global well-posedness, by constructing a different Lyapunov functional based on the spherical Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Constant potentials do not minimise the fundamental gap on convex domains in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every $n \geq 2$ and $D &gt; 0$ there exist a convex domain $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb H^n$ with diameter $D$ and a convex potential $V$ on $\Omega$ such that the fundamental gap of the operator $-\Delta+V$ is strictly smaller than the fundamental gap of $-\Delta$. In comparison to previous work, this result requires more refined control of the eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>High-Voltage Ionized Gas with Spherical Cathode Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a plasma that is created by a high voltage difference, which is known as a Townsend gas discharge. The plasma is confined to the region between two concentric spheres, one of which is a cathode and the other an anode. Ion-electron pairs are created by collisions inside the plasma. Additional electrons enter the plasma by collisions of ions with the cathode. We prove under certain conditions that there are many steady states exhibiting gas discharge, beginning with a `sparking' voltage. In fact, there is an analytic one-parameter family of them that connects the non-ionized gas to a plasma with arbitrarily high ionization or arbitrarily high potential, or else the family ends at an `anti-sparking' voltage.</description>

      <title>First Eigenvalue and Torsional Rigidity: Isoperimetric Inequalities for the Fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fractional counterpart of a generalized Kohler-Jobin inequality, showing that, among all bounded, open sets $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with Lipschitz boundary, having the same fractional torsional rigidity, the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1(\Omega)$ of the fractional Laplacian attains its minimum on balls. With the same arguments we also establish a reverse H\"older inequality for an eigenfunction corresponding to $\lambda_1(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>On the subcritical Lane-Emden equation on Riemannian models with polynomial volume growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the problems of existence and non-existence of positive solutions for the Sobolev-subcritical Lane-Emden equation on certain Riemannian manifolds (mainly models) with asymptotically negative curvature, which, from the viewpoint of the volume growth of geodesic balls, can be regarded as intermediate settings between the Euclidean and the hyperbolic spaces.
  A number of interesting phenomena arise: the subcritical regime naturally divides into three further ranges, characterized by existence phenomena (slightly subcritical), non-existence phenomena (strongly subcritical), and by a mixed behavior where existence and non-existence strongly depend on additional assumptions on the manifold (intermediate). In the intermediate regime, we further show that the radial homogeneous Dirichlet problem in geodesics balls may admit multiple positive solutions, thereby revealing substantial differences with respect to both the Euclidean and the hyperbolic settings.</description>

      <title>Solutions of the thin film equation obtained in the limit of vanishing slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of thin liquid droplets in the lubrication approximation with different slip conditions at the liquid-solid interface. Motivated by the classical no-slip paradox which states that the Navier-Stokes equations with a no-slip boundary condition require unphysical infinite dissipation during droplet spreading, we focus on the limit of vanishing slip. We show that in the no-slip limit three fundamentally different classes of limiting solutions are approached, each of them corresponding to a different scaling of the microscopic contact angle as the regularization parameter vanishes. These findings suggest that the thin-film equation with no slip supports a rich family of physically admissible solutions, provided one interprets the no-slip thin film equation as the asymptotic limit of models which regularized slip conditions. Even though the large apparent contact angles in some of these solutions seem incompatible with the lubrication approximation, a refined analysis shows that the underlying physical variables remain consistent with the assumptions for the lubrication approximation.</description>

      <title>Solution concepts for a model of visco-elasto-plasticity with slight compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model for the deformation of a visco-elasto-plastic material that is nearly incompressible. It originates from geophysics, is given in the Eulerian description and combines a Kelvin-Voigt rheology in the spherical part with a Jeffreys-type rheology in the deviatoric part. Despite a constant density, the model allows for non-isochoric deformation and the propagation of pressure waves. An additive decomposition of the strain rate into elastic and inelastic parts leads to an evolution equation for the small elastic strain, which is coupled with an adapted momentum equation. As plasticity is modeled through a non-smooth dissipation potential, we introduce a weak formulation in terms of a variational inequality. Since the well-posedness in such a weak setting is out of reach, we study two possible modifications: the regularization in terms of stress diffusion, and the relaxation of the solvability concept by transition to energy-variational solutions. In both cases, solutions are constructed by the same time-discrete scheme, consisting of solving a saddle-point problem in each time step.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Hopf-Oleinik lemma for degenerate fully nonlinear operators and applications to free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative inhomogeneous Hopf-Oleinik lemma for viscosity solutions of $$|\nabla u|^{\alpha}F(D^{2}u)=f $$ and, more generally, for viscosity supersolutions of $|\nabla u|^{\alpha}\,{M}^-_{\lambda,\Lambda}(D^{2}u)\le f$. The result yields linear boundary growth with universal constants depending only on the structural data. We also exhibit a counterexample showing that the Hopf lemma fails for equations that act only in the large-gradient regime (in the sense of Imbert and Silvestre), thereby delineating the scope of our theorem. As applications, we obtain Lipschitz regularity for viscosity solutions of one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problems driven by these degenerate fully nonlinear operators and derive $\varepsilon$-uniform Lipschitz bounds for a one-phase flame propagation model.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Biharmonic Equations with Weighted Exponential Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: nonlinearities and spatial weights of H\'enon type. Motivated by the symmetry-breaking phenomena observed in semilinear second-order problems -- such as those governed by the H\'enon equation -- we consider weighted functionals of the form \begin{equation*} F_m(u) = \int_B |x|^\alpha \left( e^{\sigma |u|^2} - \sum_{k=0}^m \frac{\sigma^k}{k!} |u|^{2k} \right) dx, \end{equation*} defined on the unit ball \( B \subset \mathbb{R}^4 \), where $m\in \mathbb N_0$ \( \alpha &gt; 0 \), \( \sigma&gt;0\) are suitable parameters. We first establish an Adams-type inequality with weight, characterizing the sharp threshold for the boundedness of \( F \) on the unit sphere of the biharmonic Sobolev space. Then, we prove that for large values of the weight exponent \( \alpha \), radial symmetry of maximizers is broken. %, i.e., the supremum of the functional is strictly larger when taken over the full space compared to the radial subspace. These results extend classical findings in the second-order setting (e.g., Trudinger--Moser-type functionals and the weighted H\'enon equation)
  to the biharmonic context and offer new insights into the interplay between weights, nonlinearity, and symmetry in higher-order PDEs.</description>

      <title>Classification of atmospheric traveling waves at cloud level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify within the quasi-geostrophic framework all types of traveling waves in zonal bands of the planetary atmosphere at cloud level according to their wave speeds. This classification pertains to waves of all amplitudes, going beyond the small-amplitude perturbative regime. It provides a structurally robust criterion for determining which traveling-wave profiles are dynamically possible and we show that each wave classification type was observed on Jupiter or Saturn. Building on this classification, we also investigate the related rigidity issue for large-amplitude traveling waves and waves propagating near shear flows. Our study offers a unified quantitative characterization of the intrinsic constraints for traveling waves in the quasi-geostrophic regime of planetary atmospheric flow.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for active Brownian particle models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive linear stability analysis of active Brownian particle systems around a constant homogeneous state. These scalar models, being important prototypes for the continuous description of active matter, are Fokker-Planck type equations in position-orientation and are known to exhibit motility-induced phase separation. We fully characterize the linear stability and instability regimes, with an explicit threshold depending on the effective speed of the particles. In this way, we rigorously confirm a conjecture on phase separation originating in the physics and applied literature. Our sharp and quantitative (in)stability results are valid both in the non-diffusive case and in the case of small angular diffusion. In the stable non-diffusive regime, we uncover a mixing mechanism reminiscent of Landau damping for the Vlasov equation, albeit with significantly weaker decay. This decay is non-integrable in time and gives rise to substantial mathematical difficulties; in particular, it prevents the use of classical perturbative arguments to treat the case of small angular diffusion.</description>

      <title>The Fractional Stefan Problem: Global Regularity of the Bounded Selfsimilar Solution"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of the bounded self-similar solution to the one-phase Stefan problem with fractional diffusion posed on the whole line. In terms of the enthalpy $h(x,t)$, the evolution problem reads \[ \begin{cases} \partial_t h + (-\Delta)^s \Phi(h) = 0 &amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,T),\\[2mm] h(\cdot,0) = h_0 &amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^n , \end{cases} \] where $u = \Phi(h) := (h-L)_+ = \max\{h-L,0\}$ denotes the temperature, $L&gt;0$ is the latent heat, and $s \in (0,1)$. We prove that the regularity of the self-similar solution depends on $s$, with a critical threshold at $s = 1/2$. More precisely, in the subcritical case $0 &lt; s &lt; 1/2$, the self-similar solution exhibits at least $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity, with H\"older exponent $\alpha &gt;0$. In contrast, we show that the enthalpy of the self-similar solution is not Lipschitz continuous at the free boundary in the critical case $s=1/2$, as well as in the supercritical case $1/2 &lt; s &lt; 1$. Additional results are also established concerning the lateral regularity at the free boundary and the asymptotic behavior of the solution profile as $x \to \pm\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact, closed-form expression for the Newtonian potential of the characteristic function associated with two overlapping discs in the plane. This setting naturally arises when discretising nonlocal interaction terms present in models of phase separation, aggregation dynamics, and quantum systems. We characterise the convolution integral as a piecewise function on the distance between the disc centres, with transitions dictated by the geometry of the overlapping region. Additionally, we derive detailed asymptotic expansions for the small-overlap regime, which allows us to provide stable double-precision codes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Maxwell's equations with perfect electric conductor boundary conditions in three-dimensional unbounded domains which are the union of a bounded resonator and one or several semi-infinite waveguides. We are interested in the existence of electromagnetic trapped modes, i.e. $L^2$ solutions of the problem without source term. These trapped modes are associated to eigenvalues of the Maxwell's operator, that can be either below the essential spectrum or embedded in it. First for homogeneous waveguides, we present different families of geometries for which we can prove the existence of eigenvalues. Then we exhibit certain non homogeneous waveguides with local perturbations of the dielectric constants that support trapped modes. Let us mention that some of the mechanisms we propose are very specific to Maxwell's equations and have no equivalent for the scalar Dirichlet or Neumann Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and time-asymptotics of regular solutions in multidimensional thermoelasticity on domains with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we investigate the nonlinear thermoelasticity model in two- and three-dimensional convex and bounded domains. We propose new boundary conditions for the displacement. These conditions are not usual in thermoelasticity. Whereas, we posit the Neumann boundary condition for the temperature. We prove the existence of global, unique solutions for small initial data. The temperature positivity is also shown. Next, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. We show that the divergence-free part of the displacement oscillates. On the other hand, we prove that the potential part and the temperature are strongly coupled. The non-rotation part is strongly affected by heat propagation. It turns out that it tends to $0$ as $x$ approaches infinity. Additionally, the temperature converges to a constant function.
  Our techniques are firmly based on the functional $\F$ adopted from {\sc Bies, P. M., Cie\'slak, T., Fuest, M., Lankeit, J., Muha, B., and Trifunovi\'c, S.}, \emph{Existence, uniqueness, and long-time asymptotic behavior of regular solutions in multidimensional thermoelasticity}, arXiv: 2507.20794, 2025. The functional is based on the Fisher information and higher-order derivatives of the displacement. It responds well to the new boundary conditions. It allows us to close a priori estimates. We also need $L^{\infty}$-estimates for the temperature here. The Moser iterative procedure ensures it.
  The Helmholtz decomposition is applied to the displacement. The boundary conditions are crucial here. The boundary integrals that appear in the calculations at this point disappear thanks to these conditions. This allows us to split the problem into two separate ones. Each of them is associated with one part of the Helmholtz decomposition.</description>

      <title>A Li-Yau and Aronson-B\'enilan approach for the Keller-Segel system with critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Li-Yau and Aronson-B\'enilan type estimates for the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system with critical exponent $m=2-\frac 2d$, i.e. lower bounds on the Laplacian of a suitable notion of pressure in any dimension. We show that these estimates entail $L^{\infty}$ bounds on the density, depending on its initial mass, up to the critical mass case for $d \in \{ 2, 3 \}$. We deduce from these results the global existence of smooth solutions in two cases: first, when the initial data is merely a measure but has sufficiently small mass; and second, when the initial free energy is bounded, and the mass is subcritical or critical.

      <title>A measure-$L^\infty$ div-curl lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we give a very short proof of the div-curl lemma in the limit conjugate case $\mathcal M-L^\infty$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of Radon measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. The proof follows the classical approach by defining here the product in the sense of distributions via a non unique microlocal Hodge's decomposition. The result is valid for many other spaces than $\mathcal M-L^\infty$, including the classical div-curl lemma spaces $L^p-L^{p'}$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, and spaces of non conjugated regularity.</description>

      <title>Sharp pressure estimates for the Navier-Stokes system in thin porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relevant problem for applications is to model the behavior of Newtonian fluids through thin porous media, which is a domain with small thickness $\epsilon$ and perforated by periodically distributed cylinders of size and period $\epsilon^\delta$, with $\delta&gt;0$. Depending on the relation between thickness and the size of the cylinders, it was introduced in (Fabricius et al., Transp. Porous Media, 115, 473-493, 2016), (Anguiano and Su\'arez-Grau, Z. Angew. Math. Phys., 68:45, 2017) and (Anguiano and Su\'arez-Grau, Mediterr. J. Math., 15:45, 2018) that there exist three regimes depending on the value of $\delta$: $\delta\in (0,1)$, $\delta=1$ and $\delta&gt;1$. In each regime, the asymptotic behavior of the fluid is governed by a lower-dimensional Darcy's law.
  In previous studies, the Reynolds number is considered to be of order one and so, the question that arises is for what range of values of the Reynolds number the lower-dimensional Darcy laws are still valid in each regime, which represents the main the goal of this paper. In this sense, considering a fluid governed by the Navier-Stokes system and assuming the Reynolds number written in terms of the thickness $\epsilon$, we prove that, for each regime, there exists a critical Reynolds number $Re_c$ such that for every Reynolds number $Re$ with order smaller or equal than $Re_c$, the lower-dimensional Darcy law is still valid. On the contrary, for Reynolds numbers $Re$ greater than $Re_c$, the inertial term of the Navier-Stokes system has to be taken into account in the asymptotic behavior and so, the Darcy law is not valid.</description>

      <title>Roughness-induced effects on the thermomicropolar fluid flow through a thin domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the thermomicropolar fluid flow through a thin channel with rough boundary. The flow is governed by the prescribed pressure drop between the channel's ends and the heat exchange through the rough wall is allowed. Depending on the limit of the ratio between channel's thickness and the wavelength of the roughness, we rigorously derive different asymptotic models clearly showing the roughness-induced effects on the average velocity and microrotation. To accomplish that, we employ the adaptation of the unfolding method to a thin-domain setting.</description>

      <title>A generalized Reynolds equation for micropolar flows past a ribbed surface with nonzero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the lubrication framework, in this paper we consider a micropolar fluid flow through a rough thin domain, whose thickness is considered as the small parameter $\varepsilon$ while the roughness at the bottom is defined by a periodical function with period of order $\varepsilon^{\ell}$ and amplitude $\varepsilon^{\delta}$, with $\delta&gt;\ell&gt;1$. Assuming nonzero boundary conditions on the rough bottom and by means of a version of the unfolding method, we identify a critical case $\delta={3\over 2}\ell-{1\over 2}$ and obtain three macroscopic models coupling the effects of the rough bottom and the nonzero boundary conditions. In every case we provide the corresponding micropolar Reynolds equation. We apply these results to carry out a numerical study of a model of squeeze-film bearing lubricated with a micropolar fluid. Our simulations reveal the impact of the roughness coupled with the nonzero boundary conditions on the performance of the bearing, and suggest that the introduction of a rough geometry may contribute to enhancing the mechanical properties of the device.</description>

      <title>The Semi-Classical Limit from the Dirac Equation with Time-Dependent External Electromagnetic Field to Relativistic Vlasov Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the mathematically rigorous (semi-)classical limit $\hbar \to 0$ of the Dirac equation with time-dependent external electromagnetic field to relativistic Vlasov equations with Lorentz force for electrons and positrons. In this limit antimatter and spin remain as intrinsically relativistic effects on a classical level. Our global-in-time results use Wigner transforms and a Lagrange multiplier viewpoint of the matrix-valued Wigner equation. In particular, we pass to the limit in the ''full" Wigner matrix equation without projecting on the eigenspaces of the matrix-valued symbol of the Dirac operator. In the limit, the Lagrange multiplier maintains the constraint that the Wigner measure and the symbol of the Dirac operator commute and vanishes when projected on the electron or positron eigenspace. This is a different approach to the problem as discussed in [P. G\'erard, P. Markowich, N.J. Mauser, F. Poupaud: Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 50(4):323--379, 1997], where the limit is taken in the projected Wigner equation. By explicit calculation of the remainder term in the expansion of the Moyal product we are able to generalize to time-dependent potentials with much less regularity. We use uniform $L^2$ bounds for the Wigner transform, which are only possible for a special class of mixed states as initial data.</description>

      <title>A note on Poincar\'e-Sobolev type inequalities on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Poincar\'e-Sobolev type inequality on compact Riemannian manifolds where the deviation of a function from a biased average, defined using a density, is controlled by the unweighted Lebesgue norm of its gradient. Unlike classical weighted Poincar\'e inequalities, the density does not enter the measure or the Sobolev norms, but only the reference average. We show that the associated Poincar\'e constant depends quantitatively on the Lebesgue norm of the density. This framework naturally arises in the analysis of coupled elliptic systems and seems not to have been addressed in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>The Vicsek-Kuramoto model in collective dynamics: macroscopic equations and pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate an individual-based model (IBM) for self-propelled agents interacting locally on a plane. Agents are characterized by their position, the angle determining their direction of motion, and their angular velocity. The dynamics combine features of the well-known Vicsek and Kuramoto models, which describe collective dynamics and synchronization, respectively. The evolution of the directions of motion follows a Vicsek model, where agents align their orientations with the mean orientation of their neighbors, subject to some noise. Similarly, the angular velocities relax towards the average angular velocity of the neighboring agents, also subject to noise. From the IBM we derive the corresponding kinetic equation in the limit of a large number of agents and formally obtain the macroscopic equations through a macroscopic (hydrodynamic) limit. Numerical simulations of the IBM reveal a variety of patterns, including rotating clusters, traveling orientation waves, and globally synchronized rotational motion. A qualitative comparison with simulations of the macroscopic system show the ability of the macroscopic model to reproduce some emergent behavior of the IBM.</description>

      <title>Affine isoperimetric inequalities for the first eigenvalue of the $m$-th order Affine $p$-Laplace Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Haddad, Jim\'enez, and Montenegro introduced the affine $p$-Laplace operator, $p&gt;1$, and studied associated affine versions of the isoperimetric inequalities for the first eigenvalue of the affine $p$-Laplace operator, including the affine Faber-Krahn inequality and affine Talenti inequality. In this work, we introduce the $m$th-order $p$-Laplace operator $\Delta_{Q,p}^\mathcal{A} f$, which recovers the affine $p$-Laplace operator when $m=1$ and $Q$ is a symmetric interval.
  Given $n,m \in \mathbb{N}$, a sufficiently smooth convex body $Q \subset \mathbb{R}^m$, a bounded, open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $p &gt;1$, we investigate the eigenvalue problem \[\begin{cases} \Delta_{Q,p}^\mathcal{A} f = \lambda_{1,p}^\mathcal{A}(Q,\Omega) |f|^{p-2} f &amp;\text{ in } \Omega; \\ f=0 &amp; \text{ on } \partial \Omega, \end{cases} \] for $f \in W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$. Finally, we establish $m$th-order extensions of the affine Talenti inequality and affine Faber-Krahn inequality, which, upon choosing $m=1$, yield new, asymmetric versions of those aforementioned inequalities.</description>

      <title>The threshold for quantum-classical correspondence is $D \sim \hbar^{\frac43}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems, an initially localized quantum state can deviate strongly from the corresponding classical phase-space distribution after the Ehrenfest time $t_{\mathrm{E}} \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even in the limit $\hbar \to 0$. Decoherence by the environment is often invoked to explain the persistence of the quantum-classical correspondence at longer timescales. Recent rigorous results for Lindblad dynamics with phase-space diffusion strength $D$ show that quantum and classical evolutions remain close for times that are exponentially longer than the Ehrenfest time whenever $D \gg \hbar^{\frac43}$, in units set by the classical Hamiltonian. At the same time, some heuristic arguments have suggested the weaker condition $D \gg \hbar^{2}$ always suffices. Here we construct an explicit Lindbladian that demonstrates that the scaling $D \sim \hbar^{\frac43}$ is indeed the threshold for quantum-classical correspondence beyond the Ehrenfest time. Our example uses a smooth time-dependent Hamiltonian and linear Lindblad operators generating homogeneous isotropic diffusion. It exhibits an $\hbar$-independent quantum-classical discrepancy at the Ehrenfest time whenever $D \ll \hbar^{\frac43}$, even for $\hbar$-independent "macroscopic" smooth observables.</description>

      <title>Relative arbitrage problem under eigenvalue lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new formulation of the relative arbitrage problem from stochastic portfolio theory that asks for a time horizon beyond which arbitrage relative to the market exists in all ``sufficiently volatile'' markets. In our formulation, ``sufficiently volatile'' is interpreted as a lower bound on an ordered eigenvalue of the instantaneous covariation matrix, a quantity that has been studied extensively in the empirical finance literature. Upon framing the problem in the language of stochastic optimal control, we characterize the time horizon in question through the unique upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE). In a special case, this PDE amounts to the arrival time formulation of the Ambrosio-Soner co-dimension mean curvature flow. Beyond the setting of stochastic portfolio theory, the stochastic optimal control problem is analyzed for arbitrary compact, possibly non-convex, domains, thanks to a boundedness assumption on the instantaneous covariation matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution provides numerical experiments for a finite volume scheme for an approximation of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The approximation is done by a Yosida approximation of the subdifferential operator. The problem is set on a polygonal bounded domain in two or three dimensions. The non-linear character of the projection term induces challenges to implement the scheme. To this end, we provide a splitting method for the finite volume scheme. We show that the splitting method is accurate. The computational error estimates induce that the squared $L^2$-error w.r.t. time is of order $1$ as long as the noise term is small enough. For larger noise terms the order of convergence w.r.t. time might become worse.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of a stochastic non-linear parabolic equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a two-point flux approximation finite volume scheme with respect to space and the variational solution. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

Abstract: Pathwise uniqueness for stochastic PDEs with drift in differential form is a main open problem in the recent literature on regularisation by noise. This paper establishes a self-contained theory in the framework of stochastic evolution equations on separable Hilbert spaces and provides a first result to address such an issue. The singularity of the drift allows to achieve novel uniqueness results for several classes of examples, ranging from fluid-dynamics to phase-separation models.</description>

Abstract: We propose and analyze a model for antibiotic resistance transfer in a bacterial biofilm and examine antibiotic dosing strategies that are effective in bacterial elimination. In particular, we consider a 1-D model of a biofilm with susceptible, persistor and resistant bacteria. Resistance can be transferred to the susceptible bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), specifically via conjugation. We analyze some basic properties of the model, determine the conditions for existence of disinfection and coexistence states, including boundary equilibria and their stability. Numerical simulations are performed to explore different modeling scenarios and support our theoretical findings. Different antibiotic dosing strategies are then studied, starting with a continuous dosing; here we note that high doses of antibiotic are needed for bacterial elimination. We then consider periodic dosing, and again observe that insufficient levels of antibiotic per dose may lead to treatment failure. Finally, using an extended version of Pontryagin's maximum principle we determine efficient antibiotic dosing protocols, which ensure bacterial elimination while keeping the total dosing low; we note that this involves a tapered dosing which reinforces results presented in other clinical and modeling studies. We study the optimal dosing for different parameter values and note that the optimal dosing schedule is qualitatively robust.</description>

      <title>Time Optimal Control Problem for the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the time-optimal control problem for the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation, a macroscopic model that characterizes magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials across a wide temperature range, including near and above the Curie temperature. We analyze the LLB system on bounded domains in one, two, and three dimensions, establishing the existence of optimal controls that drive the magnetization to a desired target state within a minimal time frame. Utilizing a Lagrange multiplier approach and an adjoint-based framework, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Furthermore, we establish second-order sufficient conditions for local optimality, addressing the mathematical challenges posed by the system's inherent nonlinearities and the nonlinear appearance of the control in the effective magnetic field. These results provide a rigorous theoretical basis for the rapid manipulation of magnetic states, offering insights into the fundamental limits of control for nonlinear diffusion-relaxation processes in magnetism. Such findings are essential for advancing high-speed magnetic memory technologies and optimizing thermal magnetic switching in next-generation storage technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For non-trivial solutions to the zero mode equation on a closed spin manifold \[D \varphi=iA\cdot \varphi,\] we first provide a simple proof for the sharp inequality \eq{ \norm{A}_{L^n}^2 \ge \frac {n}{4(n-1)} Y(M,[g]), } where $Y(M,[g])$ is the Yamabe constant of $(M,g)$, which was obtained by Frank-Loss and Reuss. Then we classify completely the equality case by proving that equality holds if and only if $\varphi$ is a Killing spinor, and if and only if $(M,g)$ is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold with $A$ (up to scaling) as its Reeb field and $\varphi$ a vacuum up to a conformal transformation. More generalizations have been also studied.</description>

      <title>Almost sharp local Bernstein estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study local growth properties of Laplace eigenfunctions on compact Riemannian manifolds. Following the paradigm introduced by Donnelly and Fefferman in the late 1980s, an eigenfunction is expected to behave locally like a polynomial of degree comparable to the square root of the eigenvalue. In this direction we establish almost sharp local $L^{p}$--Bernstein inequalities, $p\in[1,\infty]$, conjectured by Donnelly--Fefferman in 1990. We also derive analogous estimates for $A$-harmonic functions, with the square root of the eigenvalue replaced by the doubling index.
  Our argument refines the original Donnelly--Fefferman method based on $L^{2}$--Carleman estimates. At the $L^{2}$--level, we first prove a uniform bound for the doubling index on annuli of width comparable to the wavelength. This implies, with an arbitrarily small polynomial loss, the corresponding property at the $L^{p}$--level for all $p\in[1,\infty]$. The latter step relies on a bootstrap scheme combining elliptic regularity with a patching of local Carleman estimates on small balls.</description>

      <title>The long way of a viscous vortex dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a viscous vortex dipole in $R^2$ originating from a pair of point vortices with opposite circulations. At high Reynolds number $Re &gt;&gt; 1$, the dipole can travel a very long way, compared to the distance between the vortex centers, before being slowed down and eventually destroyed by diffusion. In this regime we construct an accurate approximation of the solution in the form of a two-parameter asymptotic expansion involving the aspect ratio of the dipole and the inverse Reynolds number. We then show that the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations remains close to the approximation on a time interval of length $O(Re^\sigma)$, where $\sigma &lt; 1$ is arbitrary. This improves upon previous results which were essentially restricted to $\sigma = 0$. As an application, we provide a rigorous justification of an existing formula which gives the leading order correction to the translation speed of the dipole due to finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Local Well-posedenss of the Bartnik Static Extension Problem near Schwarzschild spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the local well-posedness of the Bartnik static metric extension problem for arbitrary Bartnik data that perturb that of any sphere in a Schwarzschild $\{t=0\}$ slice. Our result in particular includes spheres with arbitrary small mean curvature. We introduce a new framework to this extension problem by formulating the governing equations in a geodesic gauge, which reduce to a coupled system of elliptic and transport equations. Since standard function spaces for elliptic PDEs are unsuitable for transport equations, we use certain spaces of Bochner-measurable functions traditionally used to study evolution equations. In the process, we establish existence and uniqueness results for elliptic boundary value problems in such spaces in which the elliptic equations are treated as evolutionary equations, and solvability is demonstrated using rigorous energy estimates. The precise nature of the expected difficulty of solving the Bartnik extension problem when the mean curvature is very small is identified and suitably treated in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Scattering, Polyhomogeneity and Asymptotics for Quasilinear Wave Equations From Past to Future Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general construction of semiglobal scattering solutions to quasilinear wave equations in a neighbourhood of spacelike infinity including past and future null infinity, where the scattering data are posed on an ingoing null cone and along past null infinity. More precisely, we prove weighted, optimal-in-decay energy estimates and propagation of polyhomogeneity statements from past to future null infinity for these solutions, we provide an algorithmic procedure how to compute the precise coefficients in the arising polyhomogeneous expansions, and we apply this procedure to various examples. As a corollary, our results directly imply the summability in the spherical harmonic number $\ell$ of the estimates proved for fixed spherical harmonic modes in the papers [Keh22b,KM24] from the series "The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity".
  Our (physical space) methods are based on weighted energy estimates near spacelike infinity similar to those of [HV23], commutations with (modified) scaling vector fields to remove leading order terms in the relevant expansions, time inversions, as well as the Minkowskian conservation laws: $$
  \partial_u(r^{-2\ell}\partial_v(r^2\partial_v)^{\ell}(r\phi_{\ell}))=0, $$ which are satisfied if $\Box_\eta\phi=0$.
  Our scattering constructions apply to systems of equations as well and go beyond the usual class of finite energy solutions. We use this to also derive a scattering theory and prove propagation of polyhomogeneity for the Einstein vacuum equations in a harmonic gauge. In the process, we also need to introduce a novel ansatz accounting for the stronger-than-Schwarzschildean divergence of the light cones, which, in particular, extends existing exterior stability of Minkowski statements in harmonic gauge to allow for slowly decaying data as considered in [Bie10].</description>

Abstract: Consider a second-order elliptic operator $L$ in the half-plane $\mathbb R \times (0, \infty)$ with coefficients depending only on the second coordinate. The Poisson kernel for $L$ is used in the representation of positive $L$-harmonic functions, that is, solutions of $L u = 0$. In probabilistic terms, the Poisson kernel is the density function of the distribution of the diffusion in $\mathbb R \times (0, \infty)$ with generator $L$ at the hitting time of the boundary. We prove that the Poisson kernel for $L$ is bell-shaped: its $n$th derivative changes sign $n$ times. In particular, it is unimodal and it has two inflection points (it is concave, then convex, then concave again).</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stability in Fractional Hardy-Sobolev Inequalities: The Role of Euler-Lagrange Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates sharp stability estimates for the fractional Hardy-Sobolev inequality: $$\mu_{s,t}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right) \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{|u|^{2^*_s(t)}}{|x|^t} \,{\rm d}x \right)^{\frac{2}{2^*_s(t)}} \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \left|(-\Delta)^{\frac{s}{2}} u \right|^2 \,{\rm d}x, \quad \text{for all } u \in \dot{H}^s\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right),$$ where $N &gt; 2s$, $s \in (0,1)$, $0 &lt; t &lt; 2s &lt; N $, and $2^*_s(t) = \frac{2(N-t)}{N-2s}$. Here, $\mu_{s,t}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)$ represents the best constant in the inequality.
  The paper focuses on the quantitative stability results of the above inequality and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation near a positive ground-state solution. Additionally, a qualitative stability result is established for the Euler-Lagrange equation, offering a thorough characterization of the Palais-Smale sequences for the associated energy functional. These results generalize the sharp quantitative stability results for the classical Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^N$, originally obtained by Bianchi and Egnell \cite{BE91} as well as the corresponding critical exponent problem in $\mathbb{R}^N$, explored by Ciraolo, Figalli, and Maggi \cite{CFM18} in the framework of fractional calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For vector fields on a two-dimensional domain, we study the asymptotic behaviour of Modica-Mortola (or Allen-Cahn) type functionals under the assumption that the divergence converges to $0$ at a certain rate, which effectively produces a model of Aviles-Giga type. This problem will typically give rise to transition layers, which degenerate into discontinuities in the limit. We analyse the energy concentration at these discontinuities and the corresponding transition profiles.
  We derive an estimate for the energy concentration in terms of a novel geometric variational problem involving the notion of $\mathbb{R}^2$-valued $1$-currents from geometric measure theory. This in turn leads to criteria, under which the energetically favourable transition profiles are essentially one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Splash-squeeze singularities and analytic breakdown in ideal incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct splash-squeeze singularities for the free boundary ideal incompressible plasma-vacuum system, in which two arcs of the plasma boundary come together to form a smooth, glancing self-intersection. As the interface self-intersects, Sobolev norms remain bounded, although analyticity is necessarily lost. This contrasts classical splash singularities, in which solutions remain analytic up to the time of self-intersection.
  The narrowing gap bounded by these arcs is not occupied by plasma, as squeezing the plasma itself would cause blow-up in Sobolev norms. Instead, the gap represents the region outside the plasma, a vacuum carrying a nontrivial magnetic field. The plasma on either side pinches the field as the gap closes, and, in response, the field flattens to infinite order at the intersection point (and nowhere else), thereby forming an analytic singularity. This gives the first example of analytic breakdown without Sobolev blow-up in a locally well-posed free-boundary incompressible fluid system, and can be viewed as the first rigorous construction of a squeeze-type singularity, in which we study and quantify the precise behavior of an active, incompressible vector field as it is completely pinched off by a free-boundary in finite time.
  The proof combines a magnetically-aligned Lagrangian formulation of ideal MHD together with weighted elliptic estimates in the vacuum that remain uniform as the width of the gap tends to zero. Our framework may provide a starting point for the analysis of squeeze-type singularities in other incompressible fluid models.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a $k$-th capillary area measure for capillary convex bodies in the Euclidean half-space, which serves as a boundary counterpart to the classical concept of area measure (see, e.g., \cite[Chapter 8]{Sch}). We then propose a Christoffel-Minkowski problem for capillary convex bodies, to find a capillary convex body in the Euclidean half-space with a prescribed $k$-th capillary area measure. This problem is equivalent to solving a Hessian-type equation with a Robin boundary value condition. We then establish the existence and uniqueness of a smooth solution under a natural sufficient condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the fractional diffusion limit of the kinetic scattering equation with diffusive boundary condition in a strongly convex bounded domain $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. According to the nature of the boundary condition, two types of fractional heat equations may arise at the limit, corresponding to two types of isotropic stable processes reflected in $\mathcal{D}$. In both cases, when the process tries to jump across the boundary, it is stopped at the unique point where $\partial\mathcal{D}$ intersects the line segment defined by the attempted jump. It then leaves the boundary either continuously (for the first type) or by a power-law distributed jump (for the second type). The construction of these processes is done via an It\^o synthesis: we concatenate their excursions in the domain, which are obtained by translating, rotating and stopping the excursions of some stable processes reflected in the half-space. The key ingredient in this procedure is the construction of the boundary processes, i.e. the processes time-changed by their local time on the boundary, which solve stochastic differential equations driven by some Poisson measures of excursions. The well-posedness of these boundary processes relies on delicate estimates involving some geometric inequalities and the laws of the undershoot and overshoot of the excursion when it leaves the domain. We show that these reflected Markov processes are Markov and Feller, we study their infinitesimal generator and we write down the reflected fractional heat equations satisfied by their time-marginals.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk geometries from boundary entanglement entropy data for ball-shaped entangling regions. By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background. Applying this formula, we recover the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We further extend our analysis to include deformations of the bulk geometry with nontrivial dependence on boundary directions, and propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do this by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems by introducing the higher-order linearization method as a new tool in the context of holographic bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Bartnik stationary extension conjecture, which arises from the definition of the spacetime Bartnik mass for a compact region in a general initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. This conjecture posits the existence and uniqueness (up to isometry) of an asymptotically flat stationary vacuum spacetime containing an initial data set $(M, \mathfrak{g}, \Pi)$ that realizes prescribed Bartnik boundary data on $\partial M$, consisting of the induced metric, mean curvature, and appropriate components of the spacetime extrinsic curvature $\Pi$.
  Building on the analytic framework developed in arXiv:2411.02801 for the static case, we show that, in a double geodesic gauge, the stationary vacuum Einstein equations reduce to a coupled system comprising elliptic and transport-type equations, with the genuinely stationary contributions encoded in an additional boundary value problem for a $1$-form $\theta$.
  We establish local well-posedness for the Bartnik stationary metric extension problem for Bartnik data sufficiently close to that of any coordinate sphere in any initial data set (possibly non time-symmetric) in Schwarzschild spacetime. This includes spheres arbitrary close to the apparent horizon in the initial data set. A key feature of our framework is that the linearized equations decouple: the equations for the metric and potential reduce to the previously solved static case, while the boundary value problem for $\theta$ is treated independently. We prove solvability of this boundary value problem in the Bochner-measurable function spaces adapted to the coupled system developed in arXiv:2411.02801, establishing uniform estimates for the vector spherical harmonic decomposition of $\theta$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new second-order fast finite difference scheme in time for solving the Tempered Time Fractional Advection-Dispersion Equation. Under the assumption that the solution is nonsmooth at the initial time, we investigate the uniqueness, stability, and convergence of the scheme. Furthermore, we prove that the scheme achieves second-order convergence in both time and space. Finally, corresponding numerical examples are provided.</description>
