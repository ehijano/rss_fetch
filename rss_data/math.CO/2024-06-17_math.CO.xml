      <title>New Strongly Regular Graphs Found via Local Search for Partial Difference Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly regular graphs (SRGs) are highly symmetric combinatorial objects, with connections to many areas of mathematics including finite fields, finite geometries, and number theory. One can construct an SRG via the Cayley Graph of a regular partial difference set (PDS). Local search is a common class of search algorithm that iteratively adjusts a state to (locally) minimize an error function. In this work, we use local search to find PDSs. We found PDSs with 62 different parameter values in 1254 nonisomorphic groups of orders at most 147. Many of these PDSs replicate known results. In two cases, (144,52,16,20) and (147,66,25,33), the PDSs found give the first known construction of SRGs with these parameters. In some other cases, the SRG was already known but a PDS in that group was unknown. This work also corroborates the existence of (64,18,2,6) PDSs in precisely 73 groups of order 64.</description>

      <title>The irregularity strength of dense graphs -- on asymptotically optimal solutions of problems of Faudree, Jacobson, Kinch and Lehel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irregularity strength of a graph $G$, $s(G)$, is the least $k$ such that there exists a $\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$-weighting of the edges of $G$ attributing distinct weighted degrees to all vertices, or equivalently the least $k$ enabling obtaining a multigraph with nonrecurring degrees by blowing each edge $e$ of $G$ to at most $k$ copies of $e$. In 1991 Faudree, Jacobson, Kinch and Lehel asked for the optimal lower bound for the minimum degree of a graph $G$ of order $n$ which implies that $s(G)\leq 3$. More generally, they also posed a similar question regarding the upper bound $s(G)\leq K$ for any given constant $K$. We provide asymptotically tight solutions of these problems by proving that such optimal lower bound is of order $\frac{1}{K-1}n$ for every fixed integer $K\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial enumeration of lattice paths by flaws with respect to a linear boundary of rational slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a,b$ be fixed positive coprime integers. For a positive integer $g$, write $N_k(g)$ for the set of lattice paths from the startpoint $(0,0)$ to the endpoint $(ga,gb)$ with steps restricted to $\{(1,0), (0,1)\}$, having exactly $k$ flaws (lattice points lying above the linear boundary). We wish to determine $|N_k(g)|$. The enumeration of lattice paths with respect to a linear boundary while accounting for flaws has a long and rich history, dating back to the 1949 results of Chung and Feller. The only previously known values of $|N_k(g)|$ are the extremal cases $k = 0$ and $k = g(a+b)-1$, determined by Bizley in 1954. Our main result is that a certain subset of $N_k(g)$ is in bijection with $N_{k+1}(g)$. One consequence is that the value $|N_k(g)|$ is constant over each successive set of $a+b$ values of $k$. This in turn allows us to derive a recursion for $|N_k(g)|$ whose base case is given by Bizley's result for $k=0$. We solve this recursion to obtain a closed form expression for $|N_k(g)|$ for all $k$ and $g$. Our methods are purely combinatorial.</description>

      <title>Graphs of Reduced Words and Some Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of graphs of reduced words of a certain subcollection of permutations in the union $\cup_{n\geq 4}\frak{S}_{n}$ of symmetic groups is investigated. The subcollection is characterised by the hook cycle type $(n-2,1,1)$ with consecutive fixed points. A closed formula for counting the vertices of each member of the family is given and the vertex-degree polynomials for the graphs with their generating series is realised. Lastly, some isomorphisms of these graphs with various combinatorial objects are established.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Seidel Tournament Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Seidel matrix of a tournament on $n$ players is an $n\times n$ skew-symmetric matrix with entries in $\{0, 1, -1\}$ that encapsulates the outcomes of the games in the given tournament. It is known that the determinant of an $n\times n$ Seidel matrix is $0$ if $n$ is odd, and is an odd perfect square if $n$ is even. This leads to the study of the set \[ \mathcal{D}(n)= \{ \sqrt{\det S}: \mbox{ $S$ is an $n\times n$ Seidel matrix}\}. \] This paper studies various questions about $\mathcal{D}(n)$. It is shown that $\mathcal{D}(n)$ is a proper subset of $\mathcal{D}(n+2)$ for every positive even integer, and every odd integer in the interval $[1, 1+n^2/2]$ is in $\mathcal{D}(n)$ for $n$ even. The expected value and variance of $\det S$ over the $n\times n$ Seidel matrices chosen uniformly at random is determined, and upper bounds on $\max \mathcal{D}(n)$ are given, and related to the Hadamard conjecture. Finally, it is shown that for infinitely many $n$, $\mathcal{D}(n)$ contains a gap (that is, there are odd integers $k&lt;\ell &lt;m$ such that $k, m \in \mathcal{D}(n)$ but $\ell \notin \mathcal{D}(n)$) and several properties of the characteristic polynomials of Seidel matrices are established.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian on digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to compute and estimate the eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacians on directed graphs. We have devised a new method for computing Hodge spectra with the following two ingredients.
  (I) We have observed that the product rule does work for the so-called normalized Hodge operator, denoted by $\Delta _{p}^{(a)},$ where $a$ refers to the weight that is used to redefine the inner product in the spaces $\Omega _{p}$. This together with the K\"{u}nneth formula for product allows us to compute inductively the spectra of all normalized Hodge operators $\Delta _{p}^{(a)}$ on Cartesian powers including $n$-cubes and $n$-tori.
  (II) We relate in a certain way the spectra of $\Delta _{p}$ and $\Delta_{p}^{(a)}$ to those of operators $\mathcal{L}_{p}=\partial ^{\ast }\partial$ also acting on $\Omega _{p}$. Knowing the spectra of $\Delta_{p}^{(a)}$ for all values of $p$, we compute the spectra of $\mathcal{L}_{p} $ and then the spectra of $\Delta _{p}.$ This program yields the spectra of all operators $\Delta _{p}$ on all $n$-cubes and $n$-tori.</description>

      <title>On the local resilience of random geometric graphs with respect to connectivity and long cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an increasing graph property $\mathcal{P}$, a graph $G$ is $\alpha$-resilient with respect to $\mathcal{P}$ if, for every spanning subgraph $H\subseteq G$ where each vertex keeps more than a $(1-\alpha)$-proportion of its neighbours, $H$ has property $\mathcal{P}$. We study the above notion of local resilience with $G$ being a random geometric graph $G_d(n,r)$ obtained by embedding $n$ vertices independently and uniformly at random in $[0,1]^d$, and connecting two vertices by an edge if the distance between them is at most $r$.
  First, we focus on connectivity. We show that, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for $r$ a constant factor above the sharp threshold for connectivity $r_c$ of $G_d(n,r)$, the random geometric graph is $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-resilient for the property of being $k$-connected, with $k$ of the same order as the expected degree. However, contrary to binomial random graphs, for sufficiently small $\varepsilon&gt;0$, connectivity is not born $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-resilient in $2$-dimensional random geometric graphs.
  Second, we study local resilience with respect to the property of containing long cycles. We show that, for $r$ a constant factor above $r_c$, $G_d(n,r)$ is $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-resilient with respect to containing cycles of all lengths between constant and $2n/3$. Proving $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-resilience for Hamiltonicity remains elusive with our techniques. Nevertheless, we show that $G_d(n,r)$ is $\alpha$-resilient with respect to Hamiltonicity for a fixed constant $\alpha = \alpha(d)&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>On automorphism groups of polar codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past years, Polar codes have arisen as a highly effective class of linear codes, equipped with a decoding algorithm of low computational complexity. This family of codes share a common algebraic formalism with the well-known Reed-Muller codes, which involves monomial evaluations. As useful algebraic codes, more specifically known as decreasing monomial codes, a lot of decoding work has been done on Reed-Muller codes based on their rich code automorphisms. In 2021, a new permutation group decoder, referred to as the automorphism ensemble (AE) decoder, was introduced. This decoder can be applied to Polar codes and has been shown to produce similar decoding effects. However, identifying the right set of code automorphisms that enhance decoding performance for Polar codes remains a challenging task. This paper aims to characterize the full automorphism group of Polar codes. We will prove a reduction theorem that effectively reduces the problem of determining the full automorphism group of arbitrary random Polar codes to that of a specified class of Polar codes. Besides, we give exact classification of the full automorphism groups of families of Polar codes that are constructed using the Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two classes of level Eulerian posets. Both classes contain intervals of rank k+1 whose cd-index is the sum over all cd-monomials w of degree k and the coefficient of the monomial w is r to the power of the number of d's in w. We also show that the order complexes of every interval in the first class are homeomorphic to spheres.</description>

      <title>On Graph Odd Edge-Colorings and Odd Edge-Coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we fully resolve two major conjectures on odd edge-colorings and odd edge-coverings of graphs, proposed by Petru{\v{s}}evski and {\v{S}}krekovski ({\it European Journal of Combinatorics,} 91:103225, 2021). The first conjecture states that for any loopless and connected graph $G$ with $\chi_{\text{odd}}'(G)=4$, there exists an edge $e$ such that $G\backslash \{e\}$ is odd $3$-edge-colorable. The second conjecture states that any simple graph $G$ with $\chi_{\text{odd}}'(G)=4$ admits an odd $3$-edge-covering in which only one edge receives two or three colors. In addition, we strongly confirm the second conjecture by demonstrating that there exists an odd $3$-edge-covering in which only one edge receives two colors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic polyhedra are interesting mathematical objects to study in their own right. In this paper, we initialize a systematic study of two-dimensional generic polyhedra with an eye towards applications to low-dimensional topology, especially the Andrews-Curtis and Zeeman conjectures. After recalling the basic notions of generic polyhedra and fake surfaces, we derive some interesting properties of fake surfaces. Our main result is a complete classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces up to complexity 4 and a classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces without small disks of complexity 5. From this classification, we prove the contractibility conjecture for acyclic cellular fake surfaces of complexity 4, and the embedded disk conjecture up to complexity 5. We provide evidence for the conjectures that the probability of being a spine among fake surfaces is 0 and that every contractible fake surface has an embedded disk.</description>

      <title>Radial Projections in $\mathbb{R}^n$ Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the recent results on radial projections by Orponen, Shmerkin, Wang using two different methods. In particular, we show that given $X,Y\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ Borel sets and $X\neq \emptyset$. If $\dim Y \in (k,k+1]$ for some $k\in \{1,\dots, n-1\}$, then \[ \sup_{x\in X} \dim \pi_x(Y\setminus \{x\}) \geq \min \{\dim X + \dim Y - k, k\}. \] Our results give a new approach to solving a conjecture of Lund-Pham-Thu in all dimensions and for all ranges of $\dim Y$.
  The first of our two methods for proving the above theorem is shorter, utilizing a result of the first author and Gan. Our second method, though longer, follows the original methodology of Orponen--Shmerkin--Wang, and requires a higher dimensional incidence estimate and a dual Furstenberg-set estimate for lines. These new estimates may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the largest singular value of sparse non-Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09851v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for the largest singular value of sparse non-Hermitian random matrices, or directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks in the constant average degree regime $p =\frac{d}{n}$ where $d$ is fixed. Entries are assumed to have Weibull distributions with tail decaying at rate $e^{-t^{\alpha}}$ for $\alpha &gt;0$. While the law of large number results agree with the largest eigenvalue of sparse Hermitian matrices given in (Ganguly and Nam, '22) and (Ganguly, Hiesmayr and Nam, '22), large deviation results are surprisingly simpler, exhibiting a single transition at $\alpha =2$. The rate function for undirected networks with $0&lt;\alpha \leq 2$ involved a transition at $\alpha =1$ and a complicated variational formula due to the emergence of cliques with large edge-weights (Ganguly, Hiesmayr and Nam, '22). For directed networks, we introduce a clique reduction technique which reformulates the problem for undirected networks with maximum clique size $2$, and the rate function is greatly simplified. For $\alpha &gt;2$, both the law of large numbers and large deviation results are identical to the sparse Hermitian case. Our results easily generalize to rectangular i.i.d. ensembles.</description>

      <title>Addition in Dumont-Thomas Numeration Systems in Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a fixpoint of a substitution, the associated Dumont-Thomas numeration system provides a convenient immediate way to describe the fixpoint as an automatic sequence. In order to study first-order properties of these fixpoints using B\"uchi-Bruy\`ere characterization, it is necessary for the numeration system to be addable. This means that its addition relation must be computable by a finite automaton. Dumont-Thomas numeration systems can be regarded as an extension of positional numeration systems with states where the greediness is state-dependent. We introduce sequence automata as a tool to extend the results of Bruy\`ere-Hansel and Frougny-Solomyak on the regularity of the addition of Bertrand numeration systems to the case of Dumont-Thomas numeration systems related to some Pisot number. We present a practical implementation of the addition compatible with the Walnut computation tool, along with some experimental results.</description>

      <title>A Continuum Erd\H{o}s-Beck Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Erd\H{o}s--Beck Theorem from discrete geometry for fractal sets in all dimensions. More precisely, let $X\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ Borel and $k \in [0, n-1]$ be an integer. Let $\dim (X \setminus H) = \dim X$ for every $k$-dimensional hyperplane $H \in \mathcal{A}(n,k)$, and let $\mathcal L(X)$ be the set of lines that contain at least two distinct points of $X$. Then, a recent result of Ren shows
  $$ \dim \mathcal{L}(X) \geq \min \{2 \dim X, 2k\}.
  $$
  If we instead have that $X$ is not a subset of any $k$-plane, and
  $$
  0&lt;\inf_{H \in \mathcal{A}(n,k)} \dim (X \setminus H) = t &lt; \dim X,
  $$
  we instead obtain the bound
  $$ \dim \mathcal{L}(X) \geq \dim X + t.
  $$ We then strengthen this lower bound by introducing the notion of the "trapping number" of a set, $T(X)$, and obtain \[ \dim \mathcal L(X) \geq \max\{\dim X + t, \min\{2\dim X, 2(T(X)-1)\}\}, \] as consequence of our main result and of Ren's result in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally, we introduce a conjectured equality for the dimension of the line set $\mathcal{L}(X)$, which would in particular imply our results if proven to be true.</description>

      <title>$B_{n-1}$-orbits on the flag variety and the Bruhat graph for $S_{n}\times S_{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=G_{n}=GL(n)$ be the $n\times n$ complex general linear group and embed $G_{n-1}=GL(n-1)$ in the top left hand corner of $G$. The standard Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices $B_{n-1}$ of $G_{n-1}$ acts on the flag variety of $G$ with finitely many orbits. In this paper, we show that each $B_{n-1}$-orbit is the intersection of orbits of two Borel subgroups of $G$ acting on the flag variety of $G$. This allows us to give a new combinatorial description of the $B_{n-1}$-orbits by associating to each orbit a pair of Weyl group elements. The closure relations for the $B_{n-1}$-orbits can then be understood in terms of the Bruhat order on the Weyl group, and the Richardson-Springer monoid action on the orbits can be understood in terms of the classical monoid action of the Weyl group on itself. This approach makes the closure relation more transparent than in earlier work of Magyar and the monoid action significantly more computable than in our earlier papers, and also allows us to obtain new information about the orbits including a simple formula for the dimension of an orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composing two representations of the general linear groups gives rise to Littlewood's (outer) plethysm. On the level of characters, this poses the question of finding the Schur expansion of the plethysm of two Schur functions. A combinatorial interpretation for the Schur expansion coefficients of the plethysm of two Schur functions is, in general, still an open problem. We identify a proof technique of combinatorial representation theory, which we call the "$s$-perp trick", and point out several examples in the literature where this idea is used. We use the $s$-perp trick to give algorithms for computing monomial and Schur expansions of symmetric functions. In several special cases, these algorithms are more efficient than those currently implemented in {\sc SageMath}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

Abstract: The derived graph of a voltage graph consisting of a single vertex and two loops of different voltages is a circulant graph with two generators. We characterize the automorphism groups of connected, two-generator circulant graphs, and give their determining and distinguishing number, and when relevant, their cost of 2-distinguishing. We do the same for the subdivisions of connected, two-generator circulant graphs obtained by replacing one loop in the voltage graph with a directed cycle.</description>

Abstract: Given a graph $G$ rooted at a vertex $r$ and weight functions, $\gamma , \tau: E(G) \to \mathbb{R}$, the generalized cable-trench problem (CTP) is to find a single spanning tree that simultaneously minimizes the sum of the total edge cost with respect to $\tau$ and the single-source shortest paths cost with respect to $\gamma$. Although this problem is provably $NP$-complete in the general case, we examine certain tractable instances involving various graph constructions of trees and cycles, along with quantities associated to edges and vertices that arise out of these constructions. We show that given a path decomposition oracle, for graphs in which all cycles are edge disjoint, there exists a fast method to determine the cable-trench tree. Further, we examine properties of graphs which contribute to the general intractability of the CTP and present some open questions in this direction.</description>

Abstract: There are 6 families of finite polar spaces of rank $3$.
  The set of lines in a rank $3$ polar space form a rank $5$ association scheme.
  We determine the regular sets of minimal size in several of these polar spaces, and describe some examples.
  We also give a new family of Cameron--Liebler sets of generators in the polar spaces $O^+(10,q)$ when $q = 3^h$ using a regular set of lines in $O(7,q)$.</description>

      <title>Edge coloring of products of signed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2020, Behr defined the problem of edge coloring of signed graphs and showed that every signed graph $(G, \sigma)$ can be colored using exactly $\Delta(G)$ or $\Delta(G) + 1$ colors, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree in graph $G$.
  In this paper, we focus on products of signed graphs. We recall the definitions of the Cartesian, tensor, strong, and corona products of signed graphs and prove results for them. In particular, we show that $(1)$ the Cartesian product of $\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graphs is $\Delta$-edge-colorable, $(2)$ the tensor product of a $\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graph and a signed tree requires only $\Delta$ colors and $(3)$ the corona product of almost any two signed graphs is $\Delta$-edge-colorable. We also prove some results related to the coloring of products of signed paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>Large recurrence of the polynomial Van der Waerden's theorem and its application in Ramsey theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently M. Di Nasso and M. Ragosta proved an exponential version of Hindman's finite sum theorem: for every finite partition of $\mathbb{N}$, there exists a monochromatic infinite exponential pattern of a single sequence. They used the stronger version of Furstenberg's Central Sets Theorem and the theory of ultrafilters to prove their results. In this article, we prove these patterns are abundant by considering two-fold extensions of the Di Nasso-Ragosta theorem. We prove that each term of this pattern can be chosen from a finite set of any given length, consisting of a multiplicative $IP_r$ (that we will define later) set and a set consisting of geometric progression (sets containing both arithmetic and geometric progression) of finite length.
  To prove our result, first, we improve the size of the recurrence set of V. Bergelson and A. Leibmann's polynomial Van der Waerden's Theorem, and then we study its two-fold applications. First, we study monochromatic patterns involving polynomials over sum sets in additive piecewise syndetic sets. Then in the second, applying methods of induction, we construct infinitary patterns involving a two-fold improvement of the Di Nasso-Ragosta theorem. Then we study the properties of some special classes of ultrafilters witnessing variants of these patterns. Throughout our article, we use the methods from the Algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech-Compactification of discrete semigroups (for details see [N. Hindman and D. Strauss: Algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification. Walter de Gruyter\&amp; Co., Berlin, 2012.]).</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to exponential patterns in multiplicative $IP^{\star}$ sets in $\mathbb{N}$</title>

Abstract: $IP$ sets play a fundamental role in arithmetic Ramsey theory. The Finite Sums Theorem states that if we partition $\mathbb{N}$ into finitely many cells, then atleast one cell is an $IP$-set. N.Hindman proved the Finite Sums Theorem comboinatorillay in \cite{H}, which was a conjecture of Graham and Rothschild, and an algebraic proof of the Finite Sums Theorem is followed from \cite[Corollary 5.10]{HS}. In \cite[Theorem 2.6]{BH94} V. Bergelson and Hindman combinatorially proved that for an additive $IP^{\star}$ set $A$ and any sequence $\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ there exists a sum subsystem $\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of $\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that $FS\left(\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\cup FP \left(\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\subset A$. For multiplicative $IP^{\star}$-set, an analogous study was made by A.sisto in \cite{S} using algebra of the Stone-$\check{C}$ Compactification of $\mathbb{N}$ and he proved that for any multiplicative $IP^{\star}$ set $A$ there exist some infinite sequences $\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ and $\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of $\mathbb{N}$ such that $FS\left(\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\cup FE^{I}\left(\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\cup FP\left(\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\cup FE^{II}\left(\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\subseteq A$. In this article, we will provide a combinatorial proof of the same result.</description>

Abstract: In 1977 Carlitz and Scoville introduced the cycle $(\alpha,t)$-Eulerian polynomials $A^{\mathrm{cyc}}_n(x,y, t\,|\,\alpha)$ by enumerating permutations with respect to the number of excedances, drops, fixed points and cycles. In this paper, we introduce a nine-variable generalization of the Eulerian polynomials $A_n(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4, f, g, t\,|\,\alpha, \beta)$ in terms of descent based statistics of permutations and prove a connection formula between these two kinds of generalized Eulerian polynomials. By exploring the connection formula, we derive plainly the exponential generating function of the latter polynomials and various $\gamma$-positive formulas for variants of Eulerian polynomials. In particular, our results unify and strengthen the recent results by Ji and Ji-Lin. In related work to the transition matrix between the Specht and web bases, Hwang, Jang and Oh recently introduced the web permutations, which can be characterised by cycle Andr\'e permutations. We show that enumerating the latter permutations with respect to the number of drops, fixed points and cycles gives rise to the normalised $\gamma$-vectors of the $(\alpha,t)$-Eulerian polynomials. Our result generalizes and unifies several known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Matroid variant of Matiyasevich formula and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1977, Yu. V. Matiyasevich proposed a formula expressing the chromatic polynomial of an arbitrary graph as a linear combination of flow polynomials of subgraphs of the original graph. In this paper, we prove that this representation is a particular case of one (easily verifiable) formula, namely, the representation of the characteristic polynomial of an arbitrary matroid as a linear combination of characteristic polynomials of dual matroids. As an application, we represent the flow polynomial of a complete graph with $n$ vertices as the sum of elementary terms with respect to all partitions of positive integer $n$. Since the growth rate of the number of all partitions is less than exponential, this technique allows us to evaluate the flow polynomial for values of $n\approx 50$. We also get an explicit expression for the characteristic polynomial of the matroid dual to the matroid of the projective geometry over a finite field. We prove, in particular, that major coefficients of all these polynomials coincide with the beginning of the row in the Pascal triangle, whose number equals the quantity of elements in the corresponding matroid. At the end part of the paper, we consider one more approach, which allows us to obtain the same results of application of our main theoren by using properties of the Tutte polynomial and the classical Rota formula for coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matroid. In addition, we describe the connection between the matroid variant of the Matiyasevich formula and convolution formulas for Tutte polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A three-path-configuration is a graph consisting of three pairwise internally-disjoint paths the union of every two of which is an induced cycle of length at least four. A graph is 3PC-free if no induced subgraph of it is a three-path-configuration. We prove that 3PC-free graphs have poly-logarithmic tree-independence number. More explicitly, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that every $n$-vertex 3PC-free graph graph has a tree decomposition in which every bag has stability number at most $c (\log n)^2$. This implies that the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, as well as several other natural algorithmic problems, that are known to be NP-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time if the input graph is 3PC-free.</description>

      <title>Weak saturation rank: a failure of linear algebraic approach to weak saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$ and a positive integer $n$, the weak $F$-saturation number $\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,F)$ is the minimum number of edges in a graph $H$ on $n$ vertices such that the edges missing in $H$ can be added, one at a time, so that every edge creates a copy of $F$. Kalai in 1985 introduced a linear algebraic approach that became one of the most efficient tools to prove lower bounds on weak saturation numbers. If $W$ is a vector space spanned by vectors $w(e)$ assigned to edges $e$ of $K_n$ in such a way that, for every copy $F'\subset K_n$ of $F$, there exist non-zero $\lambda_e$, $e\in E(F')$, satisfying $\sum_{e\in E(F')}\lambda_e w(e)=0$, then $\mathrm{dim}W\leq \mathrm{wsat}(K_n,F)$. In this paper, we prove limitations of this approach: we show infinitely many $F$ such that, for every vector space $W$ as above, $\mathrm{dim}W&lt;\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,F)$. We also suggest a modification of this approach that allows to get tight lower bounds even when the original linear algebraic approach is not sufficient. Finally, we generalise our results to random graphs, complete multipartite graphs, and hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of quotient-convergence for sequences of submodular set functions, providing, among others, a new framework for the study of convergence of matroids through their rank functions. Extending the limit theory of bounded degree graphs, which analyzes graph sequences via neighborhood sampling, we address the challenge posed by the absence of a neighborhood concept in matroids. We show that any bounded set function can be approximated by a sequence of finite set functions that quotient-converges to it. In addition, we explicitly construct such sequences for increasing, submodular, and upper continuous set functions, and prove the completeness of the space under quotient-convergence.</description>

      <title>Cycle Matroids of Graphings: From Convergence to Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent line of research has concentrated on exploring the links between analytic and combinatorial theories of submodularity, uncovering several key connections between them. In this context, Lov\'asz initiated the study of matroids from an analytic point of view and introduced the cycle matroid of a graphing. Motivated by the limit theory of graphs, the authors introduced a form of right-convergence, called quotient-convergence, for a sequence of submodular setfunctions, leading to a notion of convergence for matroids through their rank functions. In this paper, we study the connection between local-global convergence of graphs and quotient-convergence of their cycle matroids. We characterize the exposed points of the associated convex set, forming an analytic counterpart of matroid base-polytopes. Finally, we consider dual planar graphings and show that the cycle matroid of one is the cocycle matroid of its dual if and only if the underlying graphings are hyperfinite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new framework that exploits combinatorial optimization for efficiently generating a large variety of combinatorial objects based on graphs, matroids, posets and polytopes. Our method relies on a simple and versatile algorithm for computing a Hamilton path on the skeleton of any 0/1-polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$, where $X\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$. The algorithm uses as a black box any algorithm that solves a variant of the classical linear optimization problem $\min\{w\cdot x\mid x\in X\}$, and the resulting delay, i.e., the running time per visited vertex on the Hamilton path, is only by a factor of $\log n$ larger than the running time of the optimization algorithm. When $X$ encodes a particular class of combinatorial objects, then traversing the skeleton of the polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$ along a Hamilton path corresponds to listing the combinatorial objects by local change operations, i.e., we obtain Gray code listings. As concrete results of our general framework, we obtain efficient algorithms for generating all ($c$-optimal) bases in a matroid; ($c$-optimal) spanning trees, forests, ($c$-optimal) matchings in a general graph; ($c$-optimal) vertex covers, ($c$-optimal) stable sets in a bipartite graph; as well as ($c$-optimal) antichains and ideals of a poset. The delay and space required by these algorithms are polynomial in the size of the matroid, graph, or poset, respectively, and these listings correspond to Hamilton paths on the corresponding combinatorial polytopes. We also obtain an $O(t_{\rm LP} \log n)$ delay algorithm for the vertex enumeration problem on 0/1-polytopes $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\mid Ax\leq b\}$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}^m$, and $t_{\rm LP}$ is the time needed to solve the linear program $\min\{w\cdot x\mid Ax\leq b\}$. This improves upon the 25-year old $O(t_{\rm LP}\,n)$ delay algorithm of Bussieck and L\"ubbecke.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a notion of pattern avoidance in binary trees that generalizes the avoidance of contiguous tree patterns studied by Rowland and non-contiguous tree patterns studied by Dairyko, Pudwell, Tyner, and Wynn. Specifically, we propose algorithms for generating different classes of binary trees that are characterized by avoiding one or more of these generalized patterns. This is achieved by applying the recent Hartung-Hoang-M\"utze-Williams generation framework, by encoding binary trees via permutations. In particular, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between tree patterns and certain mesh permutation patterns. We also conduct a systematic investigation of all tree patterns on at most 5 vertices, and we establish bijections between pattern-avoiding binary trees and other combinatorial objects, in particular pattern-avoiding lattice paths and set partitions.</description>
