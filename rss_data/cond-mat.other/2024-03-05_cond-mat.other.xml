      <title>Towards Hamiltonian Simulation with Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to Hamiltonian simulation using Decision Diagrams (DDs), which are an exact representation based on exploiting redundancies in representations of quantum states and operations. While the simulation of Hamiltonians has been studied extensively, scaling these simulations to larger or more complex systems is often challenging and may require approximations or new simulation methods altogether. DDs offer such an alternative that has not yet been applied to Hamiltonian simulation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of DDs for this task. To this end, we review the basics of DDs such as their construction and present how the relevant operations for Hamiltonian simulation are implemented in this data structure -- leading to the first DD-based Hamiltonian simulation approach. Based on several series of evaluations and comparisons, we then discuss insights about the performance of this complementary approach. Overall, these studies show that DDs indeed may offer a promising new data structure which, for certain examples, can provide orders of magnitudes of improvement compared to the state-of-the-art, yet also comes with its own, fundamentally different, limitations.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced drift in Marangoni-driven transport of surfactant: a Lagrangian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Successive drops of coloured ink mixed with surfactant are deposited onto a thin film of water to create marbling patterns in the Japanese art technique of Suminagashi. To understand the physics behind this and other applications where surfactant transports adsorbed passive matter at gas-liquid interfaces, we investigate the Lagrangian trajectories of material particles on the surface of a thin film of a confined viscous liquid under Marangoni-driven spreading by an insoluble surfactant. We study a model problem in which several deposits of exogenous surfactant simultaneously spread on a bounded rectangular surface containing a pre-existing endogenous surfactant. We derive Eulerian and Lagrangian formulations of the equations governing the Marangoni-driven surface flow. Both descriptions show how confinement can induce drift and flow reversal during spreading. The Lagrangian formulation captures trajectories without the need to calculate surfactant concentrations; however, concentrations can still be inferred from the Jacobian of the map from initial to current particle position. We explore a link between thin-film surfactant dynamics and optimal transport theory to find the approximate equilibrium locations of material particles for any given initial condition by solving a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We find that, as the endogenous surfactant concentration $\delta$ vanishes, the equilibrium shapes of deposits using the Monge-Amp\`ere approximation approach polygons with corners curving in a self-similar manner over lengths scaling as $\delta^{1/2}$. We explore how Suminagashi patterns may be produced by using computationally efficient successive solutions of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of particle mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an effective field theory to study \emph{indirect} mixing of two fields induced by their couplings to a common decay channel in a medium. The extension of the method of Lee, Oehme and Yang, the cornerstone of analysis of CP violation in flavored mesons, to include mixing of particles with different masses provides a guide to and benchmark for the effective field theory. The analysis reveals subtle caveats in the description of mixing in terms of the widely used non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, more acute in the non-degenerate case. The effective field theory describes the dynamics of field mixing where the common intermediate states populate a bath in thermal equilibrium, as an \emph{open quantum system}. We obtain the effective action up to second order in the couplings, where indirect mixing is a consequence of off-diagonal self-energy components. We find that if only one of the mixing fields features an initial expectation value, indirect mixing induces an expectation value of the other field. The equal time two point correlation functions exhibit asymptotic approach to a stationary thermal state, and the emergence of long-lived \emph{bath induced} coherence which display quantum beats as a consequence of interference of quasinormal modes in the medium. The amplitudes of the quantum beats are resonantly enhanced in the nearly degenerate case with potential observational consequences.</description>
