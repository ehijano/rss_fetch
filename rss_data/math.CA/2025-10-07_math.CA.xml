      <title>Jensen convex functions and doubly stochastic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an nxn doubly stochastic matrix P satisfying an appropriate condition of linear algebraic-type, and a function f defined on a nonempty interval, we show that the validity of a convexity-type functional inequality for f in terms P implies that f is Jensen convex. We also prove that if f is convex, then the functional inequality in question holds for all doubly stochastic matrices of any order. The particular case when the doubly stochastic matrix is a circulant one is also considered.</description>

      <title>A weighted formulation of refined decoupling and inequalities of Mizohata-Takeuchi-type for the moment curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a compact patch of a well-curved $C^{n+1}$ curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with induced Lebesgue measure ${\rm d} \lambda$, and let $g \mapsto \widehat{g \,{\rm d}\lambda}$ be the Fourier extension operator for $\Gamma$. Then we have, for arbitrary non-negative weights $w$, \begin{equation*}
  \int_{B_R} |\widehat{g \,{\rm d}\lambda}|^2w \leq C_{n,a} R^{a} \sup_S \left(\int_S w\right)\int_\Gamma |g|^2 \, {\rm d} \lambda
  \end{equation*} for any $a&gt; \frac{n-3}{2} + \frac{2}{n} - \frac{2}{n^2(n+1)}$, where the $\sup$ is over all $1$-neighbourhoods $S$ of hyperplanes whose normals are parallel to the tangent at some point of $\Gamma$. This represents partial progress on the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture for curves in dimensions $n \geq 3$, improving upon the exponent $a=n-1$ which can be obtained as a consequence of the Agmon-H\"ormander trace inequality. Our main tool in establishing this inequality will be a weighted formulation of refined decoupling for well-curved curves. We also discuss the sharpness of the exponents we obtain in this and in auxiliary results, and further explore this in the context of axiomatic decoupling for curves.</description>

      <title>The parabolic Dirichlet problem with continuous and H\"older boundary data, and rough coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide very mild sufficient conditions for space-time domains (non-necessarily cylindrical) which ensure that the continuous Dirichlet problem and the H\"older Dirichlet problem are well-posed, for any parabolic operator in divergence form with merely bounded coefficients. Concretely, we show that the parabolic measure exists, even for unbounded domains, hence solving an open problem posed by Genschaw and Hofmann (2020).
  This problem has inherent difficulties because of its parabolic nature, as the behavior of solutions near the boundary may depend strongly on the values of the coefficients of the operator. One of our sufficient conditions, the time-backwards capacity density condition, is a quantitative version of the parabolic Wiener's criterion, and hence is adapted to the operator under consideration. The other condition, the time-backwards Hausdorff content condition, is (albeit slightly stronger) purely geometrical and independent of the operator, hence much easier to check in practice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a construction of radial Fourier interpolation formulas in dimensions 3 and 4 using Maass--Poincar\'e type series. As a corollary we obtain explicit formulas for the basis functions of these interpolation formulas in terms of what we call real-variable Kloosterman sums, which were previously introduced by Stoller. We also improve the bounds on the corresponding basis functions $a_{n,d}(x)$, $d=3,4$, for fixed $x$, in terms of the index $n$.</description>

      <title>The functional Loomis-Whitney type inequality in the Heisenberg groups and Projection theorems over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a functional Loomis--Whitney framework on the finite Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and discover connections to the boundedness and orthogonal projection problems. For $n=1$ we determine the sharp region of exponents $(u_1,u_2)$ for which the associated bilinear projection form is bounded uniformly in $q$, namely \[ \frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{2}{u_2}\le 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2}{u_1}+\frac{1}{u_2}\le 2, \] which includes the endpoint $L^{3/2}\times L^{3/2}\to L^1$. For general $n$ we prove a multilinear estimate at the critical exponent \[ u=\frac{n(2n+1)}{n+1}, \] via an induction on $n$ that exploits the group's fiber structure together with multilinear interpolation. Specializing to indicators yields a sharp Loomis--Whitney type set inequality that controls $|K|$ for every finite $K\subset \mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ by the sizes of its $2n$ Heisenberg projections $\{\pi_j(K)\}$, forcing a large projection in every configuration. A straightening map then converts these bounds into covering statements by additive cosets and provides a new approach to the orthogonal projection problem onto the vertical hyperplanes $\{x_j=0\}$, which presents an interesting link between commutative and non-commutative settings. The obtained results are optimal up to absolute constants, and in the planar case $n=1$, when the size of the set is not too small, our bound can be sharpened further using a point--line incidence estimate.</description>

      <title>A phase-space approach to weighted Fourier extension inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to expose and investigate natural phase-space formulations of two longstanding problems in the restriction theory of the Fourier transform. These problems, often referred to as the Stein and Mizohata--Takeuchi conjectures, assert that Fourier extension operators associated with rather general (codimension 1) submanifolds of Euclidean space, may be effectively controlled by the classical X-ray transform via weighted $L^2$ inequalities. Our phase-space formulations, which have their origins in recent work of Dendrinos, Mustata and Vitturi, expose close connections with a conjecture of Flandrin from time-frequency analysis, and rest on the identification of an explicit ``geometric" Wigner transform associated with an arbitrary (smooth strictly convex) submanifold $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our main results are certain natural ``Sobolev variants" of the Stein and Mizohata--Takeuchi conjectures, and involve estimating the Sobolev norms of such Wigner transforms by geometric forms of classical bilinear fractional integrals. Our broad geometric framework allows us to explore the role of the curvature of the submanifold in these problems, and in particular we obtain bounds that are independent of any lower bound on the curvature; a feature that is uncommon in the wider restriction theory of the Fourier transform. Finally, we provide a further illustration of the effectiveness of our analysis by establishing a form of Flandrin's conjecture in the plane with an $\varepsilon$-loss. While our perspective comes primarily from Euclidean harmonic analysis, the procedure used for constructing phase-space representations of extension operators is well-known in optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an existence theorem for the sliding boundary variant of the Plateau problem for $2$-dimensional sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The simplest case of sufficient condition is when $n=3$ and the boundary $\Gamma$ is a finite disjoint union of smooth closed curves contained in the boundary of a convex body, but the main point of our sufficient condition is to prevent the limits in measure of a minimizing sequence to have singularities of type $\mathbb{Y}$ along $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that contiguity relations of hypergeometric functions of several variables give a direct sampling algorithm from the conditional distribution of toric models in statistics. The algorithm is based on a Markov chain on a lattice generated by a matrix $A$. A correspondence between decomposable graphical models and $A$-hypergeometric systems is discussed. We give a sum formula of special values of $A$-hypergeometric polynomials. Some examples with implementations are presented.</description>

Abstract: This note aims to present novel positive linear operators involving the Wright function.

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution.
  We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variationality of the equation of conformal geodesics is an important problem in geometry with applications to general relativity. Recently it was proven that, in three dimensions, this system of equations for un-parametrized curves is the Euler-Lagrange equations of a certain conformally invariant functional, while the parametrized system in three dimensions is not variational. We demonstrate that variationality fails in higher dimensions for both parametrized and un-parametrized conformal geodesics, indicating that variational principle may be the selection principle for the physical dimension.</description>

      <title>Bicomplex Hardy Classes of Solutions to Beltrami Equations and the Schwarz Boundary Value Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions on the complex unit disk which solve bicomplex versions of the Beltrami and related equations. Using representations in terms of their complex-valued counterparts, we show these bicomplex-valued functions recover the boundary behavior associated with the classic holomorphic Hardy spaces. This work generalizes known results for complex-valued functions and continues recent work in the setting of bicomplex analogues of Hardy spaces of both holomorphic and generalized analytic functions. Also, we show Schwarz and Dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the bicomplex Beltrami equation are solvable and provide solution formulas.</description>

Abstract: Answering a question of Michael Bleicher and Paul Erd\H{o}s, we show that there exists a lacunary sequence of positive integers such that finite sums of reciprocals of its terms attain all rational numbers from a non-empty open interval. We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rationals infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</description>
