      <title>Sharpness of the percolation phase transition for weighted random connection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the sharpness of the percolation phase transition for a class of infinite-range weighted random connection models. The vertex set is given by a marked Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with intensity $\lambda&gt;0$, where each vertex carries an independent weight. Pairs of vertices are then connected independently with a probability that depends on both their spatial displacement and their respective weights. It is well known that such models undergo a phase transition in $\lambda$ with respect to the existence of an infinite cluster (under suitable assumptions on the connection probabilities and the weight distribution). We prove that in the subcritical regime the cluster-size distribution has exponentially decaying tails, whereas in the supercritical regime the percolation probability grows at least linearly with respect to $\lambda$ near criticality. Our proof follows the approach of Duminil-Copin, Raoufi, and Tassion, applying the OSSS inequality to a finite-lattice approximation of the continuum model in order to derive a new differential inequality, which we then analyze and pass to the limit. In addition to the classical random connection model, we consider weighted models with unbounded weights satisfying the min-reach condition under which the neighborhood of each vertex is deterministically bounded by a radius depending solely on its weight. Notably, finite range is not assumed -- that is, we allow unbounded edge lengths -- but the weight distribution is required to satisfy appropriate moment conditions. We expect that our method extends to a broad class of weighted random connection models.</description>

      <title>Repeat times and a two-weight UST model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of random weighted uniform spanning trees on the complete graph with $n$ vertices, where each edge is assigned a weight of $n^{1+\gamma}$ with probability $1/n$ and $1$ otherwise. Whenever $\gamma$ is large enough, we prove that the diameter of the resulting tree is typically of order $n^{1/3} \log n$, up to a $\log \log n$ correction. Our approach uses estimates on repeat times for selecting components in a critical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, as well as concentration bounds on the sums of diameters of these components.</description>

      <title>A stochastic optimization algorithm for revenue maximization in a service system with balking customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a service system modeled as a single-server queue, in which the service provider aims to dynamically maximize the expected revenue per unit of time. This is achieved by constructing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that dynamically adjusts the price. A key feature of our modeling framework is that customers may choose to balk - that is, decide not to join - when facing high congestion. A notable strength of our approach is that the revenue-maximizing algorithm relies solely on information about effective arrivals, meaning that only the behavior of customers who choose not to balk is observable and used in decision-making. This results in an elaborate interplay between the pricing policy and the effective arrival process, yielding a non-standard state dependent queueing process. An important contribution of our work concerns a novel Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) procedure that is able to consistently estimate the stationary effective arrival rate. This is further leveraged to construct an iterative algorithm that converges, under mild regularity conditions, to the optimal price with provable asymptotic guarantees.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mean-Fields Spin Systems in a Random External Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider general exchangeable quantum mean-field Hamiltonian such as the prominent quantum Curie-Weiss model under the influence of a random external field. Despite being arguably the simplest class of disordered quantum systems, the random external field breaks the symmetry of the mean-field Hamiltonian and hence standard quantum de Finetti type or semiclassical arguments are not directly applicable. We introduce a novel strategy in this context, which can be seen as non-commutative large deviation analysis, allowing us to characterize the limiting free energy in terms of a simple and explicit variational formula. The proposed method is general enough to be used for other classes of mean-field models such as multi species Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Expected star discrepancy based on stratified sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two main contributions to the expected star discrepancy theory. First, we derive a sharper expected upper bound for jittered sampling, improving the leading constants and logarithmic terms compared to the state-of-the-art [Doerr, 2022]. Second, we prove the strong partition principle for star discrepancy, showing that any equal-measure stratified sampling yields a strictly smaller expected discrepancy than simple random sampling, thereby resolving an open question in [Kiderlen and Pausinger, 2022]. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical advances and illustrate the superiority of stratified sampling in low to moderate dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kullback--Leibler divergence together with exponential families establishes the foundation of information geometry and is widely generalized. Among the generalization, we focus on the $(h,\tau)$-divergence and $(h,\tau)$-exponential families. We present a sufficient condition for the $(h,\tau)$-divergence to induce a Hessian structure on an $(h,\tau)$-exponential family. We also define the $(h,\tau)$-dependence of random variables and prove a kind of the law of large numbers.</description>

      <title>Littlewood-Offord bounds on the symmetric groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anti-concentration phenomenon in probability theory has been intensively studied in recent years, with applications across many areas of mathematics. In most existing works, the ambient probability space is a product space generated by independent random variables. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of anti-concentration when the ambient space is the symmetric group, equipped with the uniform measure. Concretely, we focus on the random sum $S_{\pi} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i\, v_{\pi(i)}$, where $w=(w_1,\dots,w_n)$ and $v=(v_1,\dots,v_n)$ are fixed vectors and $\pi$ is a uniformly random permutation.
  The paper contains several new results, addressing both discrete and continuous anti-concentration phenomena. On the discrete side, we establish a near-optimal structural characterization of the vectors $w$ and $v$ under the assumption that the concentration probability $\sup_x P(S_{\pi}=x)$ is polynomially large. As applications, we derive and strengthen a number of previous results. In particular, we show that if both $w$ and $v$ have distinct entries, then $\sup_x P(S_{\pi}=x) \le n^{-5/2+o(1)}$. This bound serves as a permutation-space analogue of the classical Erd\H{o}s--Moser bound in the product-space setting and answers a question posed by Alon--Pohoata--Zhu.
  From the continuous perspective, we study the small-ball event $|S_{\pi}-L|\le \delta$. We establish sharp bounds in various settings, including results exhibiting sub-gaussian decay in $L$. With additional effort, we are also able to treat the joint distribution of these events. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the vectors $w$ and $v$ for which these small-ball probabilities are large. As an application, we prove that the number of extremal points of random permutation polynomials is bounded by $O(\log n)$, extending results of S{\"o}ze on the number of real roots.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation for 1-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation with nonzero random drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave propagation for a reaction-diffusion equation on the real line, with a random drift and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) type nonlinear reaction. We show that when the average drift is positive, the asymptotic wave fronts propagating to the positive and negative directions are both pushed in the negative direction, leading to the possibility that both wave fronts propagate toward negative infinity. Our proof is based on the Large Deviations Principle for diffusion processes in random environments, as well as an analysis of the Feynman-Kac formula. Such probabilistic arguments also reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the wave fronts formation: the drift acts as an external field that shifts the (quenched) free-energy reference level without altering the intrinsic fluctuation structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Random Walks in the Quarter Plane and Periodic $4$-bar Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, going back to Darboux in 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with a finite group of the random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, in the generic case where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$ and were obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. We also consider situations with singular biquadratics. Further, we establish a new two-way relationship between \emph{diagonal} random walks in the quarter plane and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar link problems for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem, that he solved for $n=2$. We introduce \emph{$k$ semi-periodicity} as a novel and natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing new objects, \emph{the secondary $(2-2)$-correspondence} and the related \emph{secondary cubic} of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form.</description>

      <title>Exact inference via quasi-conjugacy in two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric model for time-evolving, unobserved probability distributions from discrete-time data consisting of unlabelled partitions. The latent process is a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, and observations arise via exchangeable sampling. Applications include social and genetic data where only aggregate clustering summaries are observed. To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo. Compared to particle filtering, our method achieves higher accuracy, lower variance, and substantial computational gains. We illustrate the methodology with synthetic experiments and a social network application, recovering interpretable patterns in time-varying heterozygosity.</description>

Abstract: Given an infinite connected graph, a way to randomly perturb its metric is to assign random i.i.d. lengths to the edges. An open question attributed to Furstenberg is whether there exists a two-sided infinite geodesic in first passage percolation on Z^2, and more generally on Z^n for n&gt;1. Although the answer is generally conjectured to be negative, we give a positive answer for graphs satisfying some negative curvature assumption. Assuming only strict positivity and finite exponential moment for the random lengths, we prove that if a graph X has bounded degree and contains a Morse geodesic (e.g. is non-elementary Gromov hyperbolic), then almost surely, there exists a bi-infinite geodesic in first passage percolation on X.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral gap and principle eigenfunction of the random walk in the line segment $[1, N]$ with conductances $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)_{1\le x&lt;N}$ where $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)&gt;0$ is the rate of the random walk jumping from site $x$ to site $x+1$ and vice versa. Writing $r^{(N)}(x, x+1) := 1/c^{(N)}(x, x+1)$, under the assumption \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{N\to \infty}\, \frac{1}{N}\sup_{1&lt; m \le N}\, \left| \sum_{x=2}^m r^{(N)}(x-1, x)- (m-1) \right|\;=\;0\,, \end{equation*} we prove that the spectral gap, denoted by $\mathrm{gap}_{N}$, of the process satisfies $\mathrm{gap}_{N}=(1+o(1))\pi^2/N^2$ and the principle eigenfunction $g_N$ with $g_N(1)=1$ corresponding to the spectral gap is well approximated by $h_N(x) := \cos\left( (x-1/2)\pi/N \right)$.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

      <title>Approximation results for weak solutions of stochastic partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In probability theory, how to approximate the solution of a stochastic differential equation is an important topic. In Watanabe's classical textbook, by an approximation of the Wiener process, solutions of approximated equations converge to the solution of the stochastic differential equation in probability. In traditional approximation theorems, solutions do not contain the spatial variable. In recent years, stochastic partial differential equations have been playing major roles in probability theory. If the solution is a weak one with the spatial variable, we may not be able to directly apply these classical approximation results. In this work, we try to extend the approximation result to stochastic partial differential equations case. We show that in this case, the approximation result still holds.</description>

      <title>Non-(strong, geometrically) ergodicity criteria for discrete time Markov chains on general state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For discrete-time Markov chains on general state spaces, we establish criteria for non-ergodicity and non-strong ergodicity, and derive sufficient conditions for non-geometric ergodicity via the theory of minimal nonnegative solutions. Our criteria are formulated based on the existence of solutions to inequalities involving the chain's one-step transition kernel. Meanwhile, these practical criteria are applied to a type of examples, which can effectively characterize the non-ergodicity and non-strong ergodicity of a specific class of single birth (death) processes.</description>

      <title>On the existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions of SDEs with state-dependent variable exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a time-inhomogeneous nonlinear SDE with drift and diffusion governed by state-dependent variable exponents. This framework generalizes models like the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the constant elasticity of variance (CEV), offering flexibility to capture complex dynamics while posing analytical challenges. Using a fixed-point approach, we prove existence and uniqueness, analyze higher-order moments, derive asymptotic estimates, and assess stability. Finally, we illustrate an application where the Poisson equation admits a probabilistic representation via a time-homogeneous nonlinear SDE with state-dependent variable exponents.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Approach to the Definition of the Path Integral Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We to define a Stochastic Path Integral in Lorentzian time by restricting the relevant domain of integration on $C([0,1],M)$ over a Riemannian configuration manifold $(M,g)$ and considering the dynamics of a particle evolving between to fixed endpoints with a referential non-degenerate classical trajectory. Through fibration, we reduce the infinite-dimensional space under consideration to an $L^2$-isometric flux spaces in which we consider a stochastic process associated to a Gaussian measure. The Path Integral is subsequently defined as an expectation value with respect to the Gaussian measure, allowing us to rigorously formulate the former as a functional integral. We prove equivalence of the Stochastic Path Integral to the Euclidean Path Integral theory and the Feynman-Kac theorem.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes a novel connection between null-recurrent CTMCs and electric networks, offering a systematic classification of null-recurrent behavior based on the first returning speed. By leveraging techniques from electric network theory, we present a general method for estimating the first returning speed of null recurrent birth-death processes and provide some important examples.</description>

      <title>Win rates at first-passage times for biased simple random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the win rate $R_{N_d}/N_d$ of a biased simple random walk $S_n$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ at the first-passage time $N_d=\inf\{n\ge 0:S_n=d\}$, with $p=P[X_1=+1]\in[1/2,1)$. Using generating-function techniques and integral representations, we derive explicit formulas for the expectation and variance of $R_{N_d}/N_d$ along with monotonicity properties in the threshold $d$ and the bias $p$. We also provide closed-form expressions and use them to design unbiased coin-flipping estimators of $\pi$ based on first-passage sampling; the resulting schemes illustrate how biasing the coin can dramatically improve both approximation accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Robust SGLD algorithm for solving non-convex distributionally robust optimisation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm tailored for solving a certain class of non-convex distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) problems. By deriving non-asymptotic convergence bounds, we build an algorithm which for any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ outputs an estimator whose expected excess risk is at most $\varepsilon$. As a concrete application, we consider the problem of identifying the best non-linear estimator of a given regression model involving a neural network using adversarially corrupted samples. We formulate this problem as a DRO problem and demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the proposed robust SGLD algorithm. Moreover, numerical experiments show that the robust SGLD estimator outperforms the estimator obtained using vanilla SGLD in terms of test accuracy, which highlights the advantage of incorporating model uncertainty when optimising with perturbed samples.</description>

      <title>Valuation Measure of the Stock Market using Stochastic Volatility and Stock Earnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We create a time series model for annual returns of three asset classes: the USA Standard &amp; Poor (S&amp;P) stock index, the international stock index, and the USA Bank of America investment-grade corporate bond index. Using this, we made an online financial app simulating wealth process. This includes options for regular withdrawals and contributions. Four factors are: S&amp;P volatility and earnings, corporate BAA rate, and long-short Treasury bond spread. Our valuation measure is an improvement of Shiller's cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio. We use classic linear regression models, and make residuals white noise by dividing by annual volatility. We use multivariate kernel density estimation for residuals. We state and prove long-term stability results.</description>

      <title>The Probabilistic Foundations of Surveillance Failure: From False Alerts to Structural Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, forensic statisticians have debated whether searching large DNA databases undermines the evidential value of a match. Modern surveillance faces an exponentially harder problem: screening populations across thousands of attributes using threshold rules rather than exact matching. Intuition suggests that requiring many coincidental matches should make false alerts astronomically unlikely. This intuition fails.
  Consider a system that monitors 1,000 attributes, each with a 0.5 percent innocent match rate. Matching 15 pre-specified attributes has probability \(10^{-35}\), one in 30 decillion, effectively impossible. But operational systems require no such specificity. They might flag anyone who matches \emph{any} 15 of the 1,000. In a city of one million innocent people, this produces about 226 false alerts. A seemingly impossible event becomes all but guaranteed. This is not an implementation flaw but a mathematical consequence of high-dimensional screening.
  We identify fundamental probabilistic limits on screening reliability. Systems undergo sharp transitions from reliable to unreliable with small increases in data scale, a fragility worsened by data growth and correlations. As data accumulate and correlation collapses effective dimensionality, systems enter regimes where alerts lose evidential value even when individual coincidences remain vanishingly rare. This framework reframes the DNA database controversy as a shift between operational regimes. Unequal surveillance exposures magnify failure, making ``structural bias'' mathematically inevitable. These limits are structural: beyond a critical scale, failure cannot be prevented through threshold adjustment or algorithmic refinement.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Weighted Contact Networks: Spectral Reduction and Global Stability in a Markovian SIR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new network-based SIR epidemic model in which transmission is modulated by a curvature-weighted contact matrix that encodes structural and geometric features of the underlying graph. The formulation encompasses both adjacency-driven and Markovian mixing, allowing heterogeneous interactions to be shaped by curvature-sensitive topological properties. We prove that the basic reproduction number satisfies \[ R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\lambda_{\max}(M), \] where $M$ is the curvature-weighted transmission operator. Using Perron--Frobenius theory together with linear and nonlinear Lyapunov functionals, we establish: (i) global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium when $R_0&lt;1$, and (ii) existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique endemic equilibrium when $R_0&gt;1$. Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state. This framework generalizes classical network epidemiology by integrating geometric information directly into transmission operators, providing a rigorous foundation for epidemic dynamics on structurally heterogeneous networks.</description>
