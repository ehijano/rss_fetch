      <title>Hypercovers in Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a simple proof that for several sites of interest in differential geometry, the local projective model structure and the \v{C}ech projective model structure are equal. In particular, this applies to the site of smooth manifolds with open covers and the site of cartesian spaces with good open covers. As an application, we show that for a presheaf of sets on these sites, applying the plus construction once is enough to sheafify.</description>

      <title>Tininess and right adjoints to exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objects $T$ whose exponential functor $(-)^T$ admits a right adjoint $(-)_T$ are known under different names. The fact that they exist, yet that the only set that satisfies this in the category of sets is the singleton made Lawvere suggest they ought to be ``amazingly tiny'' -- hence Lawvere's acronym ``A.T.O.M.''
  This report explores how intuitively tiny any such object is. Evidences both in favor and to the contrary are produced by looking at their categorical behavior (subobjects, quotients, retracts, etc) when the ambient category is a topos.
  The topological behavior (connectedness, contractibility, connected components, etc) of both $T$ and $(-)_T$ is further analyzed in toposes that satisfy certain precohesive conditions over their decidable objects, where this tininess is tested against parts of Lawvere's foundational proposal for Synthetic Differential Geometry.</description>

      <title>The Cylinder Simplicial DG Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a DG ring $B$ and an integer $q \geq 0$, we construct the $q$-th cylinder DG ring $Cyl_q(B)$. For $q = 1$ this is just Keller's cylinder DG ring, sometimes called the path object of $B$, which encodes homotopies between DG ring homomorphisms $A \to B$.
  As $q$ changes the cylinder DG rings form a simplicial DG ring $Cyl(B)$. Hence, given another DG ring $A$, the DG ring homomorphisms $A \to Cyl(B)$ form a simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$. Our main theorem states that when $A$ is a semi-free DG ring, the simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$ is a Kan complex.
  For the verification of the Kan condition we introduce a new construction, which may be of independent interest. Given a horn $Y$, we define the DG ring $N(Y,B)$, and we prove that $N(Y,B)$ represents this horn in the simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$. In this way the Kan condition is implemented intrinsically in the category of DG rings, thus facilitating calculations.
  Presumably all the above can be extended, with little change, from DG rings to (small) DG categories. That would enable easy constructions and explicit calculations of some simplicial aspects of DG categories.</description>

      <title>Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>

      <title>A modern perspective on rational homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Quillen's paper on rational homotopy theory, the category of 1-reduced simplicial sets is endowed with a family of model structures, the most prominent of which is the one in which the weak equivalences are the rational homotopy equivalences and the fibrant objects are the rational Kan complexes. In this paper, we give a modern approach to this family of model structures. We recover Quillen's family of model structures by first left-transferring the model structure on pointed simplicial sets and then left Bousfield localizing at the rationalization maps of spheres. Applying this localization to the model category of all spaces yields a model category in which the weak equivalences are the rational homotopy equivalences in the extended sense of G\'omez-Tato, Halperin, and Tanr\'e and the fibrant objects are the rational spaces. Thus, we generalize Quillen's family of model structures beyond the rational homotopy theory of 1-connected spaces.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of tensor categories of type $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any non-symmetric ribbon tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ with the fusion rules of the compact group of type $G_2$ needs to be equivalent to the representation category of the corresponding Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group for $q$ not a root of unity. We also prove an analogous result for the corresponding finite fusion tensor categories.</description>
