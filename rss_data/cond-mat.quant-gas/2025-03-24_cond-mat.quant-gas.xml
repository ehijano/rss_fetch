      <title>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing open photon condensates by ghost-attractor dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Fermi-Hubbard gas with three-body losses: symmetries and dark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ invariant Fermi-Hubbard gas undergoing on-site three-body losses. The model presents eight independent strong symmetries preventing the complete depletion of the gas. By making use of a basis of semi-standard Young tableaux states, we reveal the presence of a rich phenomenology of stationary states. We classify the latter according to the irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ to which they belong. We finally discuss the presence of three-particle stationary states that are not protected by the SU(3) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Modeled vortex dynamics on a Bose-Einstein condensate in a rotating lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate
  within a rotating four-site lattice which can be effectively
  described by a multimode model. Such a vortex dynamics develops
  along the low-density paths that separate the sites, and it is
  ruled by the phase differences between them. Hence, by appropriately
  selecting the initial conditions for on-site populations and phase
  differences, one can access distinct types of evolutions. We show
  that, by choosing equal populations in alternate sites, one can
  construct two-mode model Hamiltonians which allows us to model a
  large variety of associated vortex orbits. In particular, one can
  select the type of trajectory of the vortex and predict the creation
  and annihilation of vortex-antivortex pairs near the trap center.
  Estimates for the periods of closed vortex orbits and for the times
  that the vortices spend inside the lattice when dealing with open
  orbits, are obtained in terms of the two-mode models parameters and
  the rotation frequency only. We believe that the present study
  establishes a suitable platform to engineer different vortex
  dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological order in symmetric blockade structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Persistent oscillation of a Cooper-pair condensate of topological defects in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify persistent oscillations in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain. In the integrable chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of post-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Remarkably, when coupling to the next-nearest neighbor is added, the resulting nonintegrable ''zigzag'' chain (still in the quantum Ising universality class) supports persistent oscillation: Topological defects (kinks) appear as a result of the quantum phase transition. However, in a ''zigzag'' Ising chain defects can form Cooper pairs. The oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate has a frequency that depends on the binding energy gap between the paired and the unpaired defects, so it can be excited by resonant driving. While one might have expected that the integrability-breaking ''zigzag'' coupling causes relaxation, the oscillations we identify are persistent: Their longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by numerical accuracy. This oscillation of the Cooper-pair condensate of kinks is a manifestation of quantum coherence and should be experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>Slow approach to adiabaticity in many-body non-Hermitian systems: the Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the near adiabatic dynamics in a non-Hermitian quantum many-body system by investigating a finite-time ramp of the imaginary vector potential in the interacting Hatano-Nelson model. The excess energy, the Loschmidt echo, and the density imbalance are analyzed using bosonization and exact diagonalization. The energy becomes complex valued, despite the instantaneous Hamiltonian having the same real spectrum throughout. The adiabatic limit is approached very slowly through damped oscillations. The decay scales with $\tau^{-1}$ with $\tau$ the ramp duration, while the oscillation period is $2L/v$ with $v$ the Fermi velocity and $L$ the system length. Yet, without the need for auxiliary controls, a shortcut to adiabaticity is found for ramp times commensurate with the period. Our work highlights the intricate interplay of adiabaticity and non-Hermitian many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Komoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recent advance of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n-$Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with determinantal quantum Monte Carlo arises for the double occupancy and the compressibility across the Mott transition, as well as the spin structure factor in the Mott insulating state. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing a clear advantage of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model over quantum Monte Carlo methodology in the study of strong correlations.</description>
