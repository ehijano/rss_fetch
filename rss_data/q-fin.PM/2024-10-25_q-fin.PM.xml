      <title>A Case Study of Next Portfolio Prediction for Mutual Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual funds aim to generate returns above market averages. While predicting their future portfolio allocations can bring economic advantages, the task remains challenging and largely unexplored. To fill that gap, this work frames mutual fund portfolio prediction as a Next Novel Basket Recommendation (NNBR) task, focusing on predicting novel items in a fund's next portfolio. We create a comprehensive benchmark dataset using publicly available data and evaluate the performance of various recommender system models on the NNBR task.
  Our findings reveal that predicting novel items in mutual fund portfolios is inherently more challenging than predicting the entire portfolio or only repeated items. While state-of-the-art NBR models are outperformed by simple heuristics when considering both novel and repeated items together, autoencoder-based approaches demonstrate superior performance in predicting only new items.
  The insights gained from this study highlight the importance of considering domain-specific characteristics when applying recommender systems to mutual fund portfolio prediction. The performance gap between predicting the entire portfolio or repeated items and predicting novel items underscores the complexity of the NNBR task in this domain and the need for continued research to develop more robust and adaptable models for this critical financial application.</description>

      <title>Periodic portfolio selection with quasi-hyperbolic discounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an infinite-horizon, continuous-time portfolio selection problem faced by an agent with periodic S-shaped preference and present bias. The inclusion of a quasi-hyperbolic discount function leads to time-inconsistency and we characterize the optimal portfolio for a pre-committing, naive and sophisticated agent respectively. In the more theoretically challenging problem with a sophisticated agent, the time-consistent planning strategy can be formulated as an equilibrium to a static mean field game. Interestingly, present bias and naivety do not necessarily result in less desirable risk taking behaviors, while agent's sophistication may lead to excessive leverage (underinvestement) in the bad (good) states of the world.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Investment-Driven Insurance Pricing: Equilibrium Analysis and Welfare Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamic model to analyze the general equilibrium of the insurance market, focusing on the interaction between insurers' underwriting and investment strategies. Three possible equilibrium outcomes are identified: a positive insurance market, a zero insurance market, and market failure. Our findings reveal why insurers may rationally accept underwriting losses by setting a negative safety loading while relying on investment profits, particularly when there is a negative correlation between insurance gains and financial returns. Additionally, we explore the impact of regulatory frictions, showing that while imposing a cost on investment can enhance social welfare under certain conditions, it may not always be necessary. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of tailoring regulatory interventions to specific market conditions.</description>
