      <title>Physically Parameterized Differentiable MUSIC for DoA Estimation with Uncalibrated Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a common sensing problem in radar, sonar, audio, and wireless communication systems. It has gained renewed importance with the advent of the integrated sensing and communication paradigm. To fully exploit the potential of such sensing systems, it is crucial to take into account potential hardware impairments that can negatively impact the obtained performance. This study introduces a joint DoA estimation and hardware impairment learning scheme following a model-based approach. Specifically, a differentiable version of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is derived, allowing efficient learning of the considered impairments. The proposed approach supports both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, showcasing its practical potential. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method successfully learns significant inaccuracies in both antenna locations and complex gains. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms the classical MUSIC algorithm in the DoA estimation task.</description>

      <title>Modeling of UV NLoS Communication Channels: From Atmospheric Scattering and Obstacle Reflection Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As transceiver elevation angles increase from small to large, existing ultraviolet (UV) non-line-of-sight (NLoS) models encounter two challenges: i) cannot estimate the channel characteristics of UV NLoS communication scenarios when there exists an obstacle in the overlap volume between the transmitter beam and the receiver field-of-view (FoV), and ii) cannot evaluate the channel path loss for the wide beam and wide FoV scenarios with existing simplified single-scattering path loss models. To address these challenges, a UV NLoS scattering model incorporating an obstacle was investigated, where the obstacle's orientation angle, coordinates, and geometric dimensions were taken into account to approach actual application environments. Then, a UV NLoS reflection model was developed combined with specific geometric diagrams. Further, a simplified single-scattering path loss model was proposed with a closed-form expression. Finally, the proposed models were validated by comparing them with the Monte-Carlo photon-tracing model, the exact single-scattering model, and the latest simplified single-scattering model. Numerical results show that the path loss curves obtained by the proposed models agree well with those attained by related NLoS models under identical parameter settings, and avoiding obstacles is not always a good option for UV NLoS communications. Moreover, the accuracy of the proposed simplified model is superior to that of the existing simplified model for all kinds of transceiver FoV angles.</description>

      <title>Covertness in the Near Field: Maximizing the Covert Region with FDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert communication in wireless networks ensures that transmissions remain undetectable to adversaries, making it a potential enabler for privacy and security in sensitive applications. However, to meet the high performance and connectivity demands of sixth-generation (6G) networks, future wireless systems will require larger antenna arrays, higher operating frequencies, and advanced antenna architectures. This shift changes the propagation model from far-field planar-wave to near-field spherical-wave which necessitates a redesign of existing covert communication systems. Unlike far-field beamforming, which relies only on direction, near-field beamforming depends on both distance and direction, providing additional degrees of freedom for system design. In this paper, we aim to utilize those freedoms by proposing near-field Frequency Diverse Array (FDA)-based transmission strategies that manipulate the beampattern in both distance and angle, thereby establishing a non-covert region around the legitimate user. Our approach takes advantage of near-field properties and FDA technology to significantly reduce the area vulnerable to detection by adversaries while maintaining covert communication with the legitimate receiver. Numerical simulations show that our methods outperform conventional phased arrays by shrinking the non-covert region and allowing the covert region to expand as the number of antennas increases.</description>

      <title>FFT-Enhanced Low-Complexity Near-Field Super-Resolution Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-enhanced low-complexity super-resolution sensing algorithm for near-field source localization with both angle and range estimation is proposed. Most traditional near-field source localization algorithms suffer from excessive computational complexity or incompatibility with existing array architectures. To address such issues, this letter proposes a novel near-field sensing algorithm that combines coarse and fine granularity of spectrum peak search. Specifically, a spectral pattern in the angle domain is first constructed using FFT to identify potential angles where sources are present. Afterwards, a 1D beamforming is performed in the distance domain to obtain potential distance regions. Finally, a refined 2D multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is conducted within each narrowed angle-distance region to estimate the precise location of the sources. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity of 2D spectrum peak searches and achieve target localization with high-resolution.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for THz Channel Estimation and Beamforming Prediction via Sub-6GHz Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient channel estimation is of vital importance to help THz communication systems achieve their full potential. Conventional uplink channel estimation methods, such as least square estimation, are practically inefficient for THz systems because of their large computation overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) based THz channel estimator that estimates the THz channel factors using uplink sub-6GHz channel. Further, we use the estimated THz channel factors to predict the optimal beamformer from a pre-given codebook, using a dense neural network. We not only get rid of the overhead associated with the conventional methods, but also achieve near-optimal spectral efficiency rates using the proposed beamformer predictor. The proposed method also outperforms deep learning based beamformer predictors accepting THz channel matrices as input, thus proving the validity and efficiency of our sub-6GHz based approach.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to conventional RIS, the scattering matrix of a non-reciprocal RIS (NR-RIS) is non-symmetric, leading to differences in the uplink and the downlink components of NR-RIS cascaded channels. In this paper, a physically-consistent device model is proposed in which an NR-RIS is composed of multiple groups of two-port elements inter-connected by non-reciprocal devices. The resulting non-reciprocal scattering matrix is derived for various cases including two-element groups connected with isolators or gyrators, and general three-element groups connected via circulators. Signal models are given for NR-RIS operating in either reflecting-only or simultaneously transmitting and reflecting modes. The problem of NR-RIS design for non-reciprocal beamsteering is formulated for three-element circulator implementations, and numerical results confirm that non-reciprocal beamsteering can be achieved with minimal sidelobe power. We also show that our physically consistent NR-RIS architecture is effective in implementing channel reciprocity attacks, achieving similar performance to that with idealized NR-RIS models.</description>

      <title>Near-Range Environmental Perception for Inland Waterway Vessels: A Comparative Study of LiDAR and Automotive FMCW RADAR Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing towards high automation and autonomous operations is crucial for the future of inland waterway transport (IWT) systems. These systems necessitate robust and precise onboard sensory technologies that can perceive the environment under all weather conditions, including static features for local positioning techniques such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Traditional marine RADAR, mandatory on vessels and operating in the 9300-9500 MHz frequency band, can cover ranges from 15 to 1200 meters but are inadequate for detecting closer objects, making them unsuitable for automated docking maneuvers, lock entry, or bridge undercrossings. This necessitates the development of reliable close-range sensor technology that functions effectively in all weather conditions.
  In present research works on vessel automation, LiDAR sensors, operating in the nearinfrared range, are used predominantly to detect the immediate surroundings of vessels but suffer significant degradation in poor visibility. Conversely, automotive RADAR sensors, utilizing the 76-81 GHz frequency band, can detect objects from a few centimeters to up to 200 meters, even in adverse conditions. These sensors are commonly used in advanced autonomous road traffic systems and are evaluated in this study for their suitability in inland navigation and maneuvering.
  This paper discusses a distributed sensor network of four compact automotive frequencymodulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars mounted on a cabin boat as a test platform. Initial field experiments demonstrate the RADAR network's ability to perceive closerange static environmental features around the boat in inland waters. The paper also provides a comparative analysis of the environmental detection capabilities of automotive RADAR and LiDAR sensors.</description>

      <title>Phase Selection and Analysis for Multi-frequency Multi-user RIS Systems Employing Subsurfaces in Correlated Ricean and Rayleigh Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided system where the RIS is divided into subsurfaces. Each subsurface is designed specifically for one user, who is served on their own frequency band. The other subsurfaces (those not designed for this user) provide additional uncontrolled scattering. We derive the exact closed-form expression for the mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the subsurface design (SD) when all channels experience correlated Ricean fading. We simplify this to find the mean SNR for line-of-sight (LoS) channels and channels experiencing correlated Rayleigh fading. An iterative SD (ISD) process is proposed, where subsurfaces are designed sequentially, and the phases that are already set are used to enhance the design of the remaining subsurfaces. This is extended to a converged ISD (CISD), where the ISD process is repeated multiple times until the SNR increases by less than a specified tolerance. The ISD and CISD both provide a performance improvement over SD, which increases as the number of RIS elements (N) increases. The SD is significantly simpler than the lowest complexity multi-user (MU) method we know of, and despite each user having less bandwidth, the SD outperforms the existing method in some key scenarios. The SD is more robust to strongly LoS channels and clustered users, as it does not rely on spatial multiplexing like other MU methods. Combined with the complexity reduction, this makes the SD an attractive phase selection method.</description>

      <title>A General Sensing-assisted Channel Estimation Framework in Distributed MIMO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint sensing and communication (JSC) research direction has been envisioned to be a key technology in 6G communications, which has the potential to equip the traditional base station with sensing capability by fully exploiting the existing wireless communication infrastructures. To further enhance wireless communication performance in JSC, sensing-assisted communication has attracted attention from both industry and academia. However, most existing papers focused on sensing-assisted communication under line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios due to sensing limitations, where the sensing target and communication user remain the same. In this paper, we propose a general sensing-assisted channel estimation framework, where the channel estimation accuracy for both Los and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) are considered. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing-assisted communication framework achieves higher channel estimation accuracy and throughput compared to the traditional least-square (LS) estimation. More importantly, the feasibility of the proposed framework has been validated to solve the complex channel estimation challenge in distributed multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) network.</description>

      <title>Downlink MIMO Channel Estimation from Bits: Recoverability and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, a major challenge lies in acquiring the downlink channel state information}\ (CSI) at the base station (BS) from limited feedback sent by the user equipment (UE). To tackle this fundamental task, our contribution is twofold: First, a simple feedback framework is proposed, where a compression and Gaussian dithering-based quantization strategy is adopted at the UE side, and then a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is formulated at the BS side. Recoverability of the MIMO channel under the widely used double directional model is established. Specifically, analyses are presented for two compression schemes -- showing one being more overhead-economical and the other computationally lighter at the UE side. Second, to realize the MLE, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is carefully designed to integrate a sophisticated harmonic retrieval (HR) solver as subroutine, which turns out to be the key of effectively tackling this hard MLE problem.Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Data Processing Efficiency Aware User Association and Resource Allocation in Blockchain Enabled Metaverse over Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Metaverse, enhanced by blockchain technology, the efficient processing of data has emerged as a critical challenge, especially in wireless communication systems. Addressing this need, our paper introduces the innovative concept of data processing efficiency (DPE), aiming to maximize processed bits per unit of resource consumption in blockchain-empowered Metaverse environments. To achieve this, we propose the DPE-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation (DAUR) algorithm, a tailored solution for these complex systems. The DAUR algorithm transforms the challenging task of optimizing the sum of DPE ratios into a solvable convex optimization problem. It uniquely alternates the optimization of key variables like user association, work offloading ratios, task-specific computing resource distribution, bandwidth allocation, user power usage ratios, and server computing resource allocation ratios. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate the DAUR algorithm's effectiveness in DPE.</description>

      <title>Approaching Maximum Likelihood Performance via End-to-End Learning in MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems allow multiple users to share the same wireless spectrum. Each user transmits one symbol drawn from an M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) constellation set, and the resulting multi-user interference (MUI) is cancelled at the receiver. End-to-End (E2E) learning has recently been proposed to jointly design the constellation set for a modulator and symbol detector for a single user under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel by using deep neural networks (DNN) with a symbol-error-rate (SER) performance, exceeding that of Maximum likelihood (ML) M-QAM detectors. In this paper, we extend the E2E concept to the MU-MIMO systems, where a DNN-based modulator that generates learned M constellation points and graph expectation propagation network (GEPNet) detector that cancels MUI are jointly optimised with respect to SER performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed E2E with learned constellation outperforms GEPNet with 16-QAM by around 5 dB in terms of SER in a high MUI environment and even surpasses ML with 16-QAM in a low MUI condition, both with no additional computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Psychomotor Skills Using Wearable Devices: An Application in Sport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a versatile framework for optimizing psychomotor learning through human motion analysis. Utilizing a wearable IMU sensor system, the motion trajectories of a given psychomotor task are acquired and then linked to points in a performance space using a predefined set of quality metrics specific to the psychomotor skill. This enables the identification of a benchmark cluster in the performance space, allowing correspondences to be established between the performance clusters and sets of trajectories in the motion space. As a result, common or specific deviations in the performance space can be identified, enabling remedial actions in the motion space to optimize performance. A thorough validation of the proposed framework is done in this paper using a Table Tennis forehand stroke as a case study. The resulting quantitative and visual representation of performance empowers individuals to optimize their skills and achieve peak performance.</description>

      <title>Shapes of direct cortical responses vs. short-range axono-cortical evoked potentials: The effects of direct electrical stimulation applied to the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Direct cortical responses (DCR) and axono-cortical evoked potentials (ACEP) are generated by electrically stimulating the cortex either directly or indirectly through white matter pathways, potentially leading to different electrogenic processes. For ACEP, the slow conduction velocity of axons (median around 4 m.s$^{-1}$) is anticipated to induce a delay. For DCR, direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the cortex is expected to elicit additional cortical activity involving smaller and slower non-myelinated axons. We tried to validate these hypotheses. Methods: DES was administered either directly on the cortex or to white matter fascicles within the resection cavity, while recording DCR or ACEP at the cortical level in nine patients. Results: Short but significant delays (around 2 ms) were measurable for ACEP immediately following the initial component (around 7 ms). Subsequent activities (around 40 ms) exhibited notable differences between DCR and ACEP, suggesting the presence of additional cortical activities for DCR. Conclusion: Distinctions between ACEPs and DCRs can be made based on a delay at the onset of early components and the dissimilarity in the shape of the later components &gt;40 ms after the DES artifact). Significance: The comparison of different types of evoked potentials allows to better understand the effects of DES.</description>

      <title>USRP-Based Single Anchor Positioning: AoA with 5G Uplink Signals, and UWB Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel testbed designed for 5th-Generation (5G) positioning using Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs). The testbed integrates multiple units: an Operation Unit for test management, a User Unit equipped with an Ettus E312 USRP, and a Station Unit featuring an Ettus N310 USRP equipped with a three-element Uniform Linear Array for Angle of Arrival estimation. Alongside ultra wideband ranging, the testbed estimates the user's position relative to the base station. Signal processing algorithms are executed in a dedicated processing unit. Key challenges addressed include phase misalignment between RX channel pairs due to different Local Oscillators in the Ettus N310, necessitating real-time calibration for precise signal alignment. High sampling rates (up to 61.44 MSps) result in large IQ sample files, managed efficiently using a snapshot technique to optimize storage without compromising testbed positioning capabilities. The testbed synchronizes angular measurements with ranging estimates allowing consistent performance evaluation for real-life cases of dynamic users (e.g. pedestrian). Experimental results demonstrate the testbed's effectiveness in achieving accurate pedestrian user localization.</description>

      <title>Angle of Arrival Estimation Using SRS in 5G NR Uplink Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation techniques in 5G environments, using the Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) in Uplink scenarios both in simulations and with actual measurements. Leveraging 5G capabilities, we investigate AoA algorithms for single-base station positioning. The study includes simulations and practical tests on a developed dedicated testbed featuring a base station equipped with a three-element Uniform Linear Array (ULA), considering Line of Sight conditions in an open environment. The testbed, employing Ettus E312 as the transmitter and Ettus N310 as the receiver, details waveform structures and reception processes. Additionally, our study examines the performance of Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation algorithms, such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT), and Joint Angle and Delay Estimation (JADE) ESPRIT. A MATLAB ray tracing propagation model of the environment where the measurements are conducted, has been constructed. Simulation results using this model are presented, along with the actual measurements. The obtained results affirm the effectiveness of our implementation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Detection of on-Orbit Jamming for Securing GEO Satellite Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a scenario where a maneuverable satellite in geostationary orbit (GEO) conducts on-orbit attacks, targeting communication between a GEO satellite and a ground station, with the ability to switch between stationary and time-variant jamming modes. We propose a machine learning-based detection approach, employing the random forest algorithm with principal component analysis (PCA) to enhance detection accuracy in the stationary model. At the same time, an adaptive threshold-based technique is implemented for the time-variant model to detect dynamic jamming events effectively. Our methodology emphasizes the need for the use of orbital dynamics in integrating physical constraints from satellite dynamics to improve model robustness and detection accuracy. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of PCA in enhancing the performance of the stationary model, while the adaptive thresholding method achieves high accuracy in detecting jamming in the time-variant scenario. This approach provides a robust solution for mitigating the evolving threats to satellite communication in GEO environments.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Hyperparameters of a Wide-Kernel Convolutional Neural Network to Fit Different Bearing Fault Vibration Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art algorithms are reported to be almost perfect at distinguishing the vibrations arising from healthy and damaged machine bearings, according to benchmark datasets at least. However, what about their application to new data? In this paper, we are able to confirm that neural networks for bearing fault detection can be crippled by incorrect hyperparameterisation, and also that the correct hyperparameter settings can actually change when transitioning to new data. The paper weaves together multiple methods to explain the behaviour of the hyperparameters of a wide-kernel convolutional neural network and how to set them. Since guidance already exists for generic hyperparameters like minibatch size, we focus on how to set architecture-specific hyperparameters such as the width of the convolutional kernels, a topic which might otherwise be obscure. We reflect different data properties by fusing information from seven different benchmark datasets, and our results show that the kernel size in the first layer in particular is sensitive to changes in the data. Looking deeper, we use manipulated copies of one dataset in an attempt to spot why the kernel size sometimes needs to change. The relevance of sampling rate is studied by using different levels of resampling, and spectral content is studied by increasingly filtering out high frequencies. At the end of our paper we conclude by stating clear guidance on how to set the hyperparameters of our neural network architecture.</description>

      <title>Quantized symbolic time series approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in numerous science and engineering domains, e.g., signal processing, bioinformatics, and astronomy. Previous work has verified the efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering applications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to preserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream applications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly detection in time series.
  Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables efficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new quantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits improved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of symbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from quantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance this with other errors.
  An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series regression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing the symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the training of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on Monash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers a more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which contains various application domains. We further present a set of extensive experiments performed across various well-established datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the QABBA method for symbolic approximation.</description>

      <title>LightLLM: A Versatile Large Language Model for Predictive Light Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose LightLLM, a model that fine tunes pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for light-based sensing tasks. It integrates a sensor data encoder to extract key features, a contextual prompt to provide environmental information, and a fusion layer to combine these inputs into a unified representation. This combined input is then processed by the pre-trained LLM, which remains frozen while being fine-tuned through the addition of lightweight, trainable components, allowing the model to adapt to new tasks without altering its original parameters. This approach enables flexible adaptation of LLM to specialized light sensing tasks with minimal computational overhead and retraining effort. We have implemented LightLLM for three light sensing tasks: light-based localization, outdoor solar forecasting, and indoor solar estimation. Using real-world experimental datasets, we demonstrate that LightLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 4.4x improvement in localization accuracy and 3.4x improvement in indoor solar estimation when tested in previously unseen environments. We further demonstrate that LightLLM outperforms ChatGPT-4 with direct prompting, highlighting the advantages of LightLLM's specialized architecture for sensor data fusion with textual prompts.</description>

      <title>ChatBCI: A P300 Speller BCI Leveraging Large Language Models for Improved Sentence Composition in Realistic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: P300 speller BCIs allow users to compose sentences by selecting target keys on a GUI through the detection of P300 component in their EEG signals following visual stimuli. Most P300 speller BCIs require users to spell words letter by letter, or the first few initial letters, resulting in high keystroke demands that increase time, cognitive load, and fatigue. This highlights the need for more efficient, user-friendly methods for faster sentence composition. In this work, we introduce ChatBCI, a P300 speller BCI that leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to suggest words from user-spelled initial letters or predict the subsequent word(s), reducing keystrokes and accelerating sentence composition. ChatBCI retrieves word suggestions through remote queries to the GPT-3.5 API. A new GUI, displaying GPT-3.5 word suggestions as extra keys is designed. SWLDA is used for the P300 classification. Seven subjects completed two online spelling tasks: 1) copy-spelling a self-composed sentence using ChatBCI, and 2) improvising a sentence using ChatBCI's word suggestions. Results demonstrate that in Task 1, on average, ChatBCI outperforms letter-by-letter BCI spellers, reducing time and keystrokes by 62.14% and 53.22%, respectively, and increasing information transfer rate by 198.96%. In Task 2, ChatBCI achieves 80.68% keystroke savings and a record 8.53 characters/min for typing speed. Overall, ChatBCI, by employing remote LLM queries, enhances sentence composition in realistic scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional spellers without requiring local model training or storage. ChatBCI's (multi-) word predictions, combined with its new GUI, pave the way for developing next-generation speller BCIs that are efficient and effective for real-time communication, especially for users with communication and motor disabilities.</description>

      <title>Uplink Multiple Access with Heterogeneous Blocklength and Reliability Constraints: Discrete Signaling with Treating Interference as Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the uplink multiple access of heterogeneous users, e.g., ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) users. Each user has its own reliability requirement and blocklength constraint, and users transmitting longer blocks suffer from heterogeneous interference. On top of that, the decoding of URLLC messages cannot leverage successive interference cancellation (SIC) owing to the stringent latency requirements. This can significantly degrade the spectral efficiency of all URLLC users when the interference is strong. To overcome this issue, we propose a new multiple access scheme employing discrete signaling and treating interference as noise (TIN) decoding, i.e., without SIC. Specifically, to handle heterogeneous interference while maintaining the single-user encoding and decoding complexities, each user uses a single channel code and maps its coded bits onto sub-blocks of symbols, where the underlying constellations can be different. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that the proposed scheme employing quadrature amplitude modulations and TIN decoding can perform very close to the benchmark scheme based on Gaussian signaling with perfect SIC decoding. Interestingly, we show that the proposed scheme does not need to use all the transmit power budget, but also can sometimes even outperform the benchmark scheme.</description>

      <title>Single Antenna Tracking and Localization of RIS-enabled Vehicular Users</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to be employed in next generation wireless networks to enhance the communication and radio localization services. In this paper, we propose novel localization and tracking algorithms exploiting reflections through RISs at multiple receivers. We utilize a single antenna transmitter (Tx) and multiple single antenna receivers (Rxs) to estimate the position and the velocity of users (e.g. vehicles) equipped with RISs. Then, we design the RIS phase shifts to separate the signals from different users. The proposed algorithms exploit the geometry information of the signal at the RISs to localize and track the users. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization system. Compared to the time of arrival (ToA)-based localization approach, the proposed method reduces the localization error by a factor up to three. Also, the simulation results show the accuracy of the proposed tracking approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart Radio Environment (SRE) is a central paradigms in 6G and beyond, where integrating SRE components into the network planning process enables optimized performance for high-frequency Radio Access Network (RAN). This paper presents a comprehensive planning framework utilizing realistic urban scenarios and precise channel models to analyze diverse SRE components, including Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), Network-Controlled Repeater (NCR), and advanced technologies like Simultaneous transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR RIS) and trisectoral NCR (3SNCR). We propose two optimization methods, full coverage minimum cost (FCMC) and maximum budget-constrained coverage (MBCC), that address key cost and coverage objectives by considering both physical characteristics and scalable costs of each component, influenced by factors such as NCR amplification gain and RIS dimensions. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the significant impact of these models in enhancing network planning efficiency for high-density urban environments.</description>

      <title>Robust Hybrid Precoding for Millimeter Wave MU-MISO System Via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the low cost and power consumption, hybrid analog-digital architectures are considered as a promising energy-efficient solution for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The key idea is to connect one RF chain to multiple antennas through low-cost phase shifters. However, due to the non-convex objective function and constraints, we propose a gradient-guided meta-learning (GGML) based alternating optimization framework to solve this challenging problem. The GGML based hybrid precoding framework is \textit{free-of-training} and \textit{plug-and-play}. Specifically, GGML feeds the raw gradient information into a neural network, leveraging gradient descent to alternately optimize sub-problems from a local perspective, while a lightweight neural network embedded within the meta-learning framework is updated from a global perspective. We also extend the proposed framework to include precoding with imperfect channel state information. Simulation results demonstrate that GGML can significantly enhance spectral efficiency, and speed up the convergence by 8 times faster compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, GGML could even outperform fully digital weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) precoding with the same number of antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the LLM Online Spatial-temporal Reconstruction (LLM-OSR) framework, which integrates Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for online spatial-temporal signal reconstruction. The LLM-OSR utilizes a GSP-based spatial-temporal signal handler to enhance graph signals and employs LLMs to predict missing values based on spatiotemporal patterns. The performance of LLM-OSR is evaluated on traffic and meteorological datasets under varying Gaussian noise levels. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing GPT-4-o mini within the LLM-OSR is accurate and robust under Gaussian noise conditions. The limitations are discussed along with future research insights, emphasizing the potential of combining GSP techniques with LLMs for solving spatiotemporal prediction tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhalers with corticosteroids and muscle relaxants are prescribed by pulmonologists to mitigate bronchospasms that happen due to tightening of the chest. An adhesive patch attached to a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can relieve episodes of bronchospasms in the event the prescribed inhaler is not nearby. This paper shows the design and programming created to manufacture such a device. Methods: Electrical components were connected to a 3D model created in AutoCAD Fusion 360 in the order of inches. The model was imported, and simulation tests were evaluated in COMSOL Multiphysics. The device was 3D printed in the Makerspace at Hofstra University and tested for functionality. Results: The proposed design is a macromodel prototype of the micromodel adhesive patch that will attach above the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle on one side of the neck and be created in a microelectronics laboratory. Conclusion: The designed bioelectrical impedance device can detect severe muscle contractions related to the tensing and thickening of the SCM to deliver muscle relaxants to relieve acute exacerbations in patients with COPD. Significance: With this microfluidic drug delivery device even if the patient has forgotten to carry their inhaler, they are able to be relieved of the suffocating bronchospasm episode quickly and inhale their prescribed medication.</description>

Abstract: Data injection attacks (DIAs) pose a significant cybersecurity threat to the Smart Grid by enabling an attacker to compromise the integrity of data acquisition and manipulate estimated states without triggering bad data detection procedures. To mitigate this vulnerability, the moving target defense (MTD) alters branch admittances to mismatch the system information that is available to an attacker, thereby inducing an imperfect DIA construction that results in degradation of attack performance. In this paper, we first analyze the existence of stealth attacks for the case in which the MTD strategy only changes the admittance of a single branch. Equipped with this initial insight, we then extend the results to the case in which multiple branches are protected by the MTD strategy. Remarkably, we show that stealth attacks can be constructed with information only about which branches are protected, without knowledge about the particular admittance value changes. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient protection condition for the MTD strategy via graph-theoretic tools that guarantee that the system is not vulnerable to DIAs. Numerical simulations are implemented on IEEE test systems to validate the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Very Basics of Tensors with Graphical Notations: Unfolding, Calculations, and Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network diagram (graphical notation) is a useful tool that graphically represents multiplications between multiple tensors using nodes and edges. Using the graphical notation, complex multiplications between tensors can be described simply and intuitively, and it also helps to understand the essence of tensor products. In fact, most of matrix/tensor products including inner product, outer product, Hadamard product, Kronecker product, and Khatri-Rao product can be written in graphical notation. These matrix/tensor operations are essential building blocks for the use of matrix/tensor decompositions in signal processing and machine learning. The purpose of this lecture note is to learn the very basics of tensors and how to represent them in mathematical symbols and graphical notation. Many papers using tensors omit these detailed definitions and explanations, which can be difficult for the reader. I hope this note will be of help to such readers.</description>

      <title>Graph Adapter of EEG Foundation Models for Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In diagnosing mental diseases from electroencephalography (EEG) data, neural network models such as Transformers have been employed to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, it is crucial to learn the spatial relationships between EEG sensors, for which Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are commonly used. However, fine-tuning large-scale complex neural network models simultaneously to capture both temporal and spatial features increases computational costs due to the more significant number of trainable parameters. It causes the limited availability of EEG datasets for downstream tasks, making it challenging to fine-tune large models effectively. We propose EEG-GraphAdapter (EGA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach to address these challenges. EGA is integrated into pre-trained temporal backbone models as a GNN-based module and fine-tuned itself alone while keeping the backbone model parameters frozen. This enables the acquisition of spatial representations of EEG signals for downstream tasks, significantly reducing computational overhead and data requirements. Experimental evaluations on healthcare-related downstream tasks of Major Depressive Disorder and Abnormality Detection demonstrate that our EGA improves performance by up to 16.1% in the F1-score compared with the backbone BENDR model.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communications for Metaverse Construction via Generative AI and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the metaverse has boosted productivity and creativity, driving real-time updates and personalized content, which will substantially increase data traffic. However, current bit-oriented communication networks struggle to manage this high volume of dynamic information, restricting metaverse applications interactivity. To address this research gap, we propose a goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework for metaverse. Building on an existing metaverse wireless construction task, our proposed GSC framework includes an hourglass network-based (HgNet) encoder to extract semantic information of objects in the metaverse; and a semantic decoder that uses this extracted information to reconstruct the metaverse content after wireless transmission, enabling efficient communication and real-time object behaviour updates to the scenery for metaverse construction task. To overcome the wireless channel noise at the receiver, we design an optimal transport (OT)-enabled semantic denoiser, which enhances the accuracy of metaverse scenery through wireless communication. Experimental results show that compared to the conventional metaverse construction, our proposed GSC framework significantly reduces wireless metaverse construction latency by 92.6\%, while improving metaverse object status accuracy and viewing experience by 45.6\% and 44.7\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Structured Tensor Decomposition Based Channel Estimation and Double Refinements for Active RIS Empowered Broadband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel parameter estimation is crucial for optimal designs of next-generation reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications and sensing. Tensor-based mechanisms are particularly effective, capturing the multi-dimensional nature of wireless channels, especially in scenarios where RIS integrates with multiple-antenna devices. However, existing studies assume either a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario or a blocked condition for non-RIS channel. This paper solves a novel problem: tensor-based channel parameter recovery for active RIS-aided multiple-antenna wideband connections in a multipath environment with non-RIS paths. System settings are customized to construct the received signals as a fifth-order canonical polyadic (CP) tensor. Four of the five-factor matrices unfortunately contain redundant columns, and the remaining one is a Vandermonde matrix, which fails to satisfy the Kruskal condition for tensor decomposition uniqueness. To address this issue, spatial smoothing and Vandermonde structured CP decomposition (VSCPD) are applied, making the tensor factorization problem solvable and providing a relaxed general uniqueness condition. A sequential triple-stage channel estimation framework is proposed based on the factor estimates. The first stage enables multipath identification and algebraic coarse estimation, while the following two stages offer optional successive refinements at the cost of increased complexity. The closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to assess the estimation performance. Herein, the noise covariance matrix depends on multipath parameters in our active-RIS scenario. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms under various evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Turbofan Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction Based on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aviation industry is rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in technology. Turbofan engines used in commercial aerospace are very complex systems. The majority of turbofan engine components are susceptible to degradation over the life of their operation. Turbofan engine degradation has an impact to engine performance, operability, and reliability. Predicting accurate remaining useful life (RUL) of a commercial turbofan engine based on a variety of complex sensor data is of paramount importance for the safety of the passengers, safety of flight, and for cost effective operations. That is why it is essential for turbofan engines to be monitored, controlled, and maintained. RUL predictions can either come from model-based or data-based approaches. The model-based approach can be very expensive due to the complexity of the mathematical models and the deep expertise that is required in the domain of physical systems. The data-based approach is more frequently used nowadays thanks to the high computational complexity of computers, the advancements in Machine Learning (ML) models, and advancements in sensors. This paper is going to be focused on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) models but will also provide a benchmark of several RUL prediction databased models. The proposed RUL prediction models are going to be evaluated based on engine failure prediction benchmark dataset Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS). The CMAPSS dataset is from NASA which contains turbofan engine run to failure events.</description>

      <title>Polarization under the Channel Noise with Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The channel polarization under the channel noise with memory is comprehensively studied. With the help of the genie-aided channel, we prove that the polarized channels also converge to extremal channels under the standard polar codes structure. More importantly, the ratio of the perfect channel can be larger than $I(W)$ which is the capacity of the original channel. However, the polarization rate is shown to be slower than the binary-input discrete memoryless channel (DMC) case. Specifically, the upper bound of the block error is $\mathcal{O}(L^{-c_0})$ where $L$ is the block length and $c_0$ is some positive constant. Furthermore, the upper and lower bound of the gap between the capacity and cutoff rate is investigated when the block length is finite, which is more useful for practical applications.</description>

      <title>SNN-SC: A Spiking Semantic Communication Framework for Collaborative Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06836v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative Intelligence (CI) has emerged as a promising framework for deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) models on resource-constrained edge devices. In CI, the AI model is partitioned between the edge device and the cloud, with intermediate features transmitted from the edge sub-model to the cloud sub-model to complete the inference task. However, reducing feature transmission overhead while maintaining task performance remains a challenge, particularly in the case of noisy wireless channels. In this paper, we propose a Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based Semantic Communication (SC) model, SNN-SC, which extracts compact semantic information from features and transmits it through digital binary channels. Compared to the Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based SC model, whose output is floating-point, the binary output of SNN makes SNN-SC directly applicable to digital binary channels without the need for extra quantization. Moreover, we introduce a novel spiking neuron called IHF to enhance the reconstruction capability of the SNN-SC decoder. Finally, we enhance the performance of SNN-SC by maximizing the entropy of semantic information. SNN-SC achieves a higher compression ratio and overcomes the `cliff effect' compared to the traditional separate source and channel coding method. In addition, SNN-SC has lower computational complexity than the DNN-based SC model and maintains higher task performance under poor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Passive Integrated Sensing and Communication Scheme based on RF Fingerprint Information Extraction for Cell-Free RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how to achieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) based on a cell-free radio access network (CF-RAN) architecture with a minimum footprint of communication resources. We propose a new passive sensing scheme. The scheme is based on the radio frequency (RF) fingerprint learning of the RF radio unit (RRU) to build an RF fingerprint library of RRUs. The source RRU is identified by comparing the RF fingerprints carried by the signal at the receiver side. The receiver extracts the channel parameters from the signal and estimates the channel environment, thus locating the reflectors in the environment. The proposed scheme can effectively solve the problem of interference between signals in the same time-frequency domain but in different spatial domains when multiple RRUs jointly serve users in CF-RAN architecture. Simulation results show that the proposed passive ISAC scheme can effectively detect reflector location information in the environment without degrading the communication performance.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we study the energy efficiency maximization problem for a fluid antenna system (FAS) in near field communications. Specifically, we consider a point-to-point near-field system where the base station (BS) transmitter has multiple fixed-position antennas and the user receives the signals with multiple fluid antennas. Our objective is to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming of the BS and the fluid antenna positions at the user for maximizing the energy efficiency. Our scheme is based on an alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively solves the beamforming and antenna position subproblems. Our simulation results validate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm and confirm the effectiveness of FAS.</description>

Abstract: The development of wireless sensing technologies, using signals such as Wi-Fi, infrared, and RF to gather environmental data, has significantly advanced within Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Among these, Radio Frequency (RF) sensing stands out for its cost-effective and non-intrusive monitoring of human activities and environmental changes. However, traditional RF sensing methods face significant challenges, including noise, interference, incomplete data, and high deployment costs, which limit their effectiveness and scalability. This paper investigates the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) to overcome these limitations within the IoT ecosystem. We provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art GenAI techniques, focusing on their application to RF sensing problems. By generating high-quality synthetic data, enhancing signal quality, and integrating multi-modal data, GenAI offers robust solutions for RF environment reconstruction, localization, and imaging. Additionally, GenAI's ability to generalize enables IoT devices to adapt to new environments and unseen tasks, improving their efficiency and performance. The main contributions of this article include a detailed analysis of the challenges in RF sensing, the presentation of innovative GenAI-based solutions, and the proposal of a unified framework for diverse RF sensing tasks. Through case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating GenAI models, leading to advanced, scalable, and intelligent IoT systems.</description>

Abstract: This work considers the problem of enabling maximum multipath diversity of orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM)-based systems. We define and study an Affine OCDM (A-OCDM) system in which a chirp parameter is adapted to enable maximum diversity offered by frequency selective channels. Our proposed system also reduces implementation complexity by eliminating the need for precoding, compared to linear constellation precoded OCDM. Corroborating simulations are provided to show that A-OCDM also preserves OCDM systems' resilience against interference offered by spreading.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important non-invasive method for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. However, ECG signals are susceptible to noise contamination, such as electrical interference or signal wandering, which reduces diagnostic accuracy. Various ECG denoising methods have been proposed, but most existing methods yield suboptimal performance under very noisy conditions or require several steps during inference, leading to latency during online processing. In this paper, we propose a novel ECG denoising model, namely Mamba-based ECG Enhancer (MECG-E), which leverages the Mamba architecture known for its fast inference and outstanding nonlinear mapping capabilities. Experimental results indicate that MECG-E surpasses several well-known existing models across multiple metrics under different noise conditions. Additionally, MECG-E requires less inference time than state-of-the-art diffusion-based ECG denoisers, demonstrating the model's functionality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>On Broad-Beam Reflection for Dual-Polarized RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for aiding user-specific transmission has been widely explored. However, little attention has been devoted to utilizing RIS for assisting cell-specific transmission, where the RIS needs to reflect signals in a broad angular range. Furthermore, although modern communication systems operate in two polarizations, the majority of the works on RIS consider a uni-polarized surface, only reflecting the signals in one polarization. To fill these gaps, we study a downlink broadcasting scenario where a base station (BS) sends a cell-specific signal to all the users residing at unknown locations with the assistance of a dual-polarized RIS. We utilize the duality between the auto-correlation function and power spectrum in the space/spatial frequency domain to design configurations for broad-beam reflection. We first consider a free-space line-of-sight BS-RIS channel and show that the RIS configuration matrices must form a Golay complementary array pair for broad-beam radiation. We also present how to form Golay complementary array pairs based on known Golay complementary sequence pairs. We then consider an arbitrary BS-RIS channel and propose an algorithm based on stochastic optimization to find RIS configurations that produce a practically broad beam by relaxing the requirement on uniform broadness. Numerical simulations are finally conducted to corroborate the analyses and evaluate the performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assumption of using a static graph to represent multivariate time-varying signals oversimplifies the complexity of modeling their interactions over time. We propose a Dynamic Multi-hop model that captures dynamic interactions among time-varying node signals, while also accounting for time-varying edge signals, by extracting latent edges through topological diffusion and edge pruning. The resulting graphs are time-varying and sparse, capturing key dynamic node interactions and representing signal diffusion to both near and distant neighbors over time. The Dynamic Multi-hop Estimation algorithm is further proposed, accurately representing the interaction dynamics among node signals while enabling adaptive estimation of time-varying multivariate signals spatially and temporally. The Dynamic Multi-hop Estimation is evaluated under two real-world datasets of brain network and stock market for the online estimation of partially observed time-varying signals corrupted by noise.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes Graph Signal Adaptive Message Passing (GSAMP), a novel message passing method that simultaneously conducts online prediction, missing data imputation, and noise removal on time-varying graph signals. Unlike conventional Graph Signal Processing methods that apply the same filter to the entire graph, the spatiotemporal updates of GSAMP employ a distinct approach that utilizes localized computations at each node. This update is based on an adaptive solution obtained from an optimization problem designed to minimize the discrepancy between observed and estimated values. GSAMP effectively processes real-world, time-varying graph signals under Gaussian and impulsive noise conditions.</description>

      <title>SuperResolution Radar Gesture Recognitio</title>

Abstract: "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible." Driver's interaction with a vehicle via automatic gesture recognition is expected to enhance driving safety by decreasing driver's distraction. Optical and infrared-based gesture recognition systems are limited by occlusions, poor lighting, and varying thermal conditions and, therefore, have limited performance in practical in-cabin applications. Radars are insensitive to lighting or thermal conditions and, therefore, are more suitable for in-cabin applications. However, the spatial resolution of conventional radars is insufficient for accurate gesture recognition. The main objective of this research is to derive an accurate gesture recognition approach using low-resolution radars with deep learning-based super-resolution processing. The main idea is to reconstruct high-resolution information from the radar's low-resolution measurements. The major challenge is the derivation of the real-time processing approach. The proposed approach combines conventional signal processing and deep learning methods. The radar echoes are arranged in 3D data cubes and processed using a super-resolution model to enhance range and Doppler resolution. The FFT is used to generate the range-Doppler maps, which enter the deep neural network for efficient gesture recognition. The preliminary results demonstrated the proposed approach's efficiency in achieving high gesture recognition performance using conventional low-resolution radars.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Physically-Consistent Modeling of Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable electromagnetic structures (REMSs), such as reconfigurable reflectarrays (RRAs) or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), hold significant potential to improve wireless communication and sensing systems. Even though several REMS modeling approaches have been proposed in recent years, the literature lacks models that are both computationally efficient and physically consistent. As a result, algorithms that control the reconfigurable elements of REMSs (e.g., the phase shifts of an RIS) are often built on simplistic models that are inaccurate. To enable physically accurate REMS-parameter tuning, we present a new framework for efficient and physically consistent modeling of general REMSs. Our modeling method combines a circuit-theoretic approach with a new formalism that describes a REMS's interaction with the electromagnetic (EM) waves in its far-field region. Our modeling method enables efficient computation of the entire far-field radiation pattern for arbitrary configurations of the REMS reconfigurable elements once a single full-wave EM simulation of the non-reconfigurable parts of the REMS has been performed. The predictions made by the proposed framework align with the physical laws of classical electrodynamics and model effects caused by inter-antenna coupling, non-reciprocal materials, polarization, ohmic losses, matching losses, influence of metallic housings, noise from low-noise amplifiers, and noise arising in or received by antennas. In order to validate the efficiency and accuracy of our modeling approach, we (i) compare our modeling method to EM simulations and (ii) conduct a case study involving a planar RRA that enables simultaneous multiuser beam- and null-forming using a new, computationally efficient, and physically accurate parameter tuning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Which Channel, Low-rank or Full-rank, more needs RIS?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RIS, as an efficient tool to improve receive signal-to-noise ratio, extend coverage and create more spatial diversity, is viewed as a most promising technique for the future wireless networks like 6G. As you know, IRS is very suitable for a special wireless scenario with wireless link between BS and users being completely blocked. In this paper, we extend its applications to a general scenario, i.e., rank-deficient-channel, particularly some extremely low-rank ones such as no link, and line-of-sight (LoS). Actually, there are several potential important low-rank applications of like satellite, UAV communications, marine, and deep-space communications. In such a situation, it is found that RIS may make a dramatic DoF enhancement over no RIS. By using a distributed RIS placement, the DoF of channels from BS to users may be even boosted from a low-rank like 0/1 to full-rank. This will achieve an extremely rate improvement via multiple spatial streams transmission per user. In this paper, we present a complete review of make a in-depth discussion on DoF effect of RIS.</description>

      <title>Deep sr-DDL: Deep Structurally Regularized Dynamic Dictionary Learning to Integrate Multimodal and Dynamic Functional Connectomics data for Multidimensional Clinical Characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel integrated framework that jointly models complementary information from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to extract biomarkers of brain connectivity predictive of behavior. Our framework couples a generative model of the connectomics data with a deep network that predicts behavioral scores. The generative component is a structurally-regularized Dynamic Dictionary Learning (sr-DDL) model that decomposes the dynamic rs-fMRI correlation matrices into a collection of shared basis networks and time varying subject-specific loadings. We use the DTI tractography to regularize this matrix factorization and learn anatomically informed functional connectivity profiles. The deep component of our framework is an LSTM-ANN block, which uses the temporal evolution of the subject-specific sr-DDL loadings to predict multidimensional clinical characterizations. Our joint optimization strategy collectively estimates the basis networks, the subject-specific time-varying loadings, and the neural network weights. We validate our framework on a dataset of neurotypical individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database to map to cognition and on a separate multi-score prediction task on individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a five-fold cross validation setting. Our hybrid model outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches at clinical outcome prediction and learns interpretable multimodal neural signatures of brain organization.</description>

      <title>BTS: Bifold Teacher-Student in Semi-Supervised Learning for Indoor Two-Room Presence Detection Under Time-Varying CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10802v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, indoor human presence detection based on supervised learning (SL) and channel state information (CSI) has attracted much attention. However, existing studies that rely on spatial information of CSI are susceptible to environmental changes which degrade prediction accuracy. Moreover, SL-based methods require time-consuming data labeling for retraining models. Therefore, it is imperative to design a continuously monitored model using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based scheme. In this paper, we conceive a bifold teacher-student (BTS) learning approach for indoor human presence detection in an adjoining two-room scenario. The proposed SSL-based primal-dual teacher-student network intelligently learns spatial and temporal features from labeled and unlabeled CSI datasets. Additionally, the enhanced penalized loss function leverages entropy and distance measures to distinguish drifted data, i.e., features of new datasets affected by time-varying effects and altered from the original distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BTS system accomplishes an averaged accuracy of around 98% after retraining the model with unlabeled data. BTS can sustain an accuracy of 93% under the changed layout and environments. Furthermore, BTS outperforms existing SSL-based models in terms of the highest detection accuracy of around 98% while achieving the asymptotic performance of SL-based methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Wireless Federated Learning via Low-Rank Gradient Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel gradient compression method for federated learning (FL) in wireless systems. The proposed method centers on a low-rank matrix factorization strategy for local gradient compression that is based on one iteration of a distributed Jacobi successive convex approximation (SCA) at each FL round. The low-rank approximation obtained at one round is used as a "warm start" initialization for Jacobi SCA in the next FL round. A new protocol termed over-the-air low-rank compression (Ota-LC) incorporating this gradient compression method with over-the-air computation and error feedback is shown to have lower computation cost and lower communication overhead, while guaranteeing the same inference performance, as compared with existing benchmarks. As an example, when targeting a test accuracy of 70% on the Cifar-10 dataset, Ota-LC reduces total communication costs by at least 33% compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Joint Processing and Transmission Energy Optimization for ISAC in Cell-Free Massive MIMO with URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the concept of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) within a downlink cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system featuring multi-static sensing and users requiring ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). Our focus involves the formulation of two non-convex algorithms that jointly solve power and blocklength allocation for end-to-end (E2E) minimization. The objectives are to jointly minimize sensing/communication processing and transmission energy consumption, while simultaneously meeting the requirements for sensing and URLLC. To address the inherent non-convexity of these optimization problems, we utilize techniques such as the Feasible Point Pursuit - Successive Convex Approximation (FPP-SCA), Concave-Convex Programming (CCP), and fractional programming. We conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of these algorithms in ISAC scenarios and against a URLLC-only scenario where sensing is not integrated. Our numerical results highlight the superior performance of the E2E energy minimization algorithm, especially in scenarios without sensing capability. Additionally, our study underscores the increasing prominence of energy consumption associated with sensing processing tasks as the number of sensing receive access points rises. Furthermore, the results emphasize that a higher sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio threshold is associated with an escalation in E2E energy consumption, thereby narrowing the performance gap between the two proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>DeRO: Dead Reckoning Based on Radar Odometry With Accelerometers Aided for Robot Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a radar odometry structure that directly utilizes radar velocity measurements for dead reckoning while maintaining its ability to update estimations within the Kalman filter framework. Specifically, we employ the Doppler velocity obtained by a 4D Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar in conjunction with gyroscope data to calculate poses. This approach helps mitigate high drift resulting from accelerometer biases and double integration. Instead, tilt angles measured by gravitational force are utilized alongside relative distance measurements from radar scan matching for the filter's measurement update. Additionally, to further enhance the system's accuracy, we estimate and compensate for the radar velocity scale factor. The performance of the proposed method is verified through five real-world open-source datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces position error by 62% and rotation error by 66% on average compared to the state-of-the-art radar-inertial fusion method in terms of absolute trajectory error.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Least Mean pth Power Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of impulsive noise, and missing observations, accurate online prediction of time-varying graph signals poses a crucial challenge in numerous application domains. We propose the Adaptive Least Mean $p^{th}$ Power Graph Neural Networks (LMP-GNN), a universal framework combining adaptive filter and graph neural network for online graph signal estimation. LMP-GNN retains the advantage of adaptive filtering in handling noise and missing observations as well as the online update capability. The incorporated graph neural network within the LMP-GNN can train and update filter parameters online instead of predefined filter parameters in previous methods, outputting more accurate prediction results. The adaptive update scheme of the LMP-GNN follows the solution of a $l_p$-norm optimization, rooting to the minimum dispersion criterion, and yields robust estimation results for time-varying graph signals under impulsive noise. A special case of LMP-GNN named the Sign-GNN is also provided and analyzed, Experiment results on two real-world datasets of temperature graph and traffic graph under four different noise distributions prove the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed LMP-GNN.</description>

Abstract: Loudspeaker array beamforming is a common signal processing technique for acoustic directivity control and robust audio reproduction. Unlike their microphone counterpart, loudspeaker constraints are often heterogeneous due to arrayed transducers with varying operating ranges in frequency, acoustic-electrical sensitivity, efficiency, and directivity. This work proposes a frequency-regularization method for generalized Rayleigh quotient directivity specifications and two novel beamformer designs that optimize for maximum efficiency constant directivity (MECD) and maximum sensitivity constant directivity (MSCD). We derive fast converging and analytic solutions from their quadratic equality constrained quadratic program formulations. Experiments optimize generalized directivity index constrained beamformer designs for a full-band heterogeneous array.</description>

      <title>Decentralised Variational Inference Frameworks for Multi-object Tracking on Sensor Networks: Additional Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13689v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of multi-sensor multi-object tracking by proposing various decentralised Variational Inference (VI) schemes that match the tracking performance of centralised sensor fusion with only local message exchanges among neighboring sensors. We first establish a centralised VI sensor fusion scheme as a benchmark and analyse the limitations of its decentralised counterpart, which requires sensors to await consensus at each VI iteration. Therefore, we propose a decentralised gradient-based VI framework that optimises the Locally Maximised Evidence Lower Bound (LM-ELBO) instead of the standard ELBO, which reduces the parameter search space and enables faster convergence, making it particularly beneficial for decentralised tracking. This proposed framework is inherently self-evolving, improving with advancements in decentralised optimisation techniques for convergence guarantees and efficiency. Further, we enhance the convergence speed of proposed decentralised schemes using natural gradients and gradient tracking strategies. Results verify that our decentralised VI schemes are empirically equivalent to centralised fusion in tracking performance. Notably, the decentralised natural gradient VI method is the most communication-efficient, with communication costs comparable to suboptimal decentralised strategies while delivering notably higher tracking accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) in rotating machinery utilizing a single microphone and a data-driven methodology, effectively diagnosing 42 classes of fault types and severities. The research leverages sound data from the imbalanced MaFaulDa dataset, aiming to strike a balance between high performance and low resource consumption. The testing phase encompassed a variety of configurations, including sampling, quantization, signal normalization, silence removal, Wiener filtering, data scaling, windowing, augmentation, and classifier tuning using XGBoost. Through the analysis of time, frequency, mel-frequency, and statistical features, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.54% and an F-Beta score of 99.52% with just 6 boosting trees at an 8 kHz, 8-bit configuration. Moreover, when utilizing only MFCCs along with their first- and second-order deltas, we recorded an accuracy of 97.83% and an F-Beta score of 97.67%. Lastly, by implementing a greedy wrapper approach, we obtained a remarkable accuracy of 96.82% and an F-Beta score of 98.86% using 50 selected features, nearly all of which were first- and second-order deltas of the MFCCs.</description>
