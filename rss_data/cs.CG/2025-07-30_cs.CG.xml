      <title>Subquadratic Approximation Algorithms for Separating Two Points with Objects in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (unweighted) point-separation} problem asks, given a pair of points $s$ and $t$ in the plane, and a set of candidate geometric objects, for the minimum-size subset of objects whose union blocks all paths from $s$ to $t$. Recent work has shown that the point-separation problem can be characterized as a type of shortest-path problem in a geometric intersection graph within a special lifted space. However, all known solutions to this problem essentially reduce to some form of APSP, and hence take at least quadratic time, even for special object types.
  In this work, we consider the unweighted form of the problem, for which we devise subquadratic approximation algorithms for many special cases of objects, including line segments and disks. In this paradigm, we are able to devise algorithms that are fundamentally different from the APSP-based approach. In particular, we will give Monte Carlo randomized additive $+1$ approximation algorithms running in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac32})$ time for disks as well as axis-aligned line segments and rectangles, and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{11}6})$ time for line segments and constant-complexity convex polygons. We will also give deterministic multiplicative-additive approximation algorithms that, for any value $\varepsilon&gt;0$, guarantee a solution of size $(1+\varepsilon)\text{OPT}+1$ while running in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ time for disks as well as axis-aligned line segments and rectangles, and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{n^{4/3}}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ time for line segments and constant-complexity convex polygons.</description>

      <title>Geometry of nonlinear forecast reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation procedures.</description>

      <title>Kan Approximations of the Persistent Homology Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistent homology transform (PHT) of a subset $M \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a map $\text{PHT}(M):\mathbb{S}^{d-1} \to \mathbf{Dgm}$ from the unit sphere to the space of persistence diagrams. This map assigns to each direction $v\in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ the persistent homology of the filtration of $M$ in direction $v$. In practice, one can only sample the map $\text{PHT}(M)$ at a finite set of directions $A \subset \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. This suggests two natural questions: (1) Can we interpolate the PHT from this finite sample of directions to the entire sphere? If so, (2) can we prove that the resulting interpolation is close to the true PHT? In this paper we show that if we can sample the PHT at the module level, where we have information about how homology from each direction interacts, a ready-made interpolation theory due to Bubenik, de Silva, and Nanda using Kan extensions can answer both of these questions in the affirmative. A close inspection of those techniques shows that we can infer the PHT from a finite sample of heights from each direction as well. Our paper presents the first known results for approximating the PHT from finite directional and scalar data.</description>

      <title>TrajLens: Visual Analysis for Constructing Cell Developmental Trajectories in Cross-Sample Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing cell developmental trajectories is a critical task in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, enabling the inference of potential cellular progression paths. However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes continuous-space methodologies to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient between an ellipsoidal robot model and an environment surface modeled as a set of Gaussian distributions. Continuous-space collision probability estimation is critical for uncertainty-aware motion planning. Most collision detection and avoidance approaches assume the robot is modeled as a sphere, but ellipsoidal representations provide tighter approximations and enable navigation in cluttered and narrow spaces. State-of-the-art methods derive the Euclidean distance and gradient by processing raw point clouds, which is computationally expensive for large workspaces. Recent advances in Gaussian surface modeling (e.g. mixture models, splatting) enable compressed and high-fidelity surface representations. Few methods exist to estimate continuous-space occupancy from such models. They require Gaussians to model free space and are unable to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient for an ellipsoidal robot. The proposed methods bridge this gap by extending prior work in ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid Euclidean distance and collision probability estimation to Gaussian surface models. A geometric blending approach is also proposed to improve collision probability estimation. The approaches are evaluated with numerical 2D and 3D experiments using real-world point cloud data. Methods for efficient calculation of these quantities are demonstrated to execute within a few microseconds per ellipsoid pair using a single-thread on low-power CPUs of modern embedded computers</description>

      <title>Computing a Connection Matrix and Persistence Efficiently from a Morse Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morse decompositions partition the flows in a vector field into equivalent structures. Given such a decomposition, one can define a further summary of its flow structure by what is called a connection matrix.These matrices, a generalization of Morse boundary operators from classical Morse theory, capture the connections made by the flows among the critical structures - such as attractors, repellers, and orbits - in a vector field. Recently, in the context of combinatorial dynamics, an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute connection matrices has been proposed in~\cite{DLMS24}. We show that, actually, the classical persistence algorithm with exhaustive reduction retrieves connection matrices, both simplifying the algorithm of~\cite{DLMS24} and bringing the theory of persistence closer to combinatorial dynamical systems. We supplement this main result with an observation: the concept of persistence as defined for scalar fields naturally adapts to Morse decompositions whose Morse sets are filtered with a Lyapunov function. We conclude by presenting preliminary experimental results.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Spectral Partitioning Works: Bounds for Special Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral partitioning is a method that can be used to compute small sparse cuts or small edge-separators in a wide variety of graph classes, by computing the second-smallest eigenvalue (and eigenvector) of the Laplacian matrix. Upper bounds on this eigenvalue for certain graph classes imply that the method obtains small edge-separators for these classes, usually with a sub-optimal dependence on the maximum degree. In this work, we show that a related method, called reweighted spectral partitioning, guarantees near-optimal sparse vertex-cuts and vertex-separators in a wide variety of graph classes. In many cases, this involves little-to-no necessary dependence on maximum degree.
  We also obtain a new proof of the planar separator theorem, a strengthened eigenvalue bound for bounded-genus graphs, and a refined form of the recent Cheeger-style inequality for vertex expansion via a specialized dimension-reduction step.</description>
