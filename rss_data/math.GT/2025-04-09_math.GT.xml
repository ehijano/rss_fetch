      <title>A spine for the decorated Teichm\"uller space of a punctured non-orientable surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on work of Harer \cite{Ha86}, we construct a spine for the decorated Teichm\"uller space of a non-orientable surface with at least one puncture and negative Euler characteristic. We compute its dimension, and show that the deformation retraction onto this spine is equivariant with respect to the pure mapping class group of the non-orientable surface. As a consequence, we obtain a model for the classifying space for proper actions of the pure mapping class group of a punctured non-orientable surface, which is of minimal dimension in the case there is a single puncture.</description>

      <title>A structure theorem for irreducible open graph 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph manifolds are a class of compact, orientable 3-manifolds introduced in 1967 by Waldhausen as a generalization of Seifert fibered 3-manifolds. From the point of view of Thurston's geometrization program, graph manifolds are exactly the compact, orientable 3-manifolds without any hyperbolic piece in their geometric decomposition.  In this article we consider a generalization of the notion of graph manifold that includes some noncompact 3-manifolds. We prove a structure theorem for irreducible open graph manifolds in the form of a canonical 'reduced' decomposition along embedded, incompressible 2-tori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce asymptotically rigid mapping class groups of handlebodies and determine their finiteness properties, which vary depending on the space of ends of the underlying handlebody. As it turns out, in some cases, the homology of these groups coincides with the stable homology of handlebody groups, as studied by Hatcher and Wahl.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Ricci flows on infinite disk triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce combinatorial Ricci flows (CRFs in short) in Euclidean and hyperbolic background geometries on infinite triangulations of the open disk, which are discrete analogs of Ricci flows on simply connected open surfaces. We establish well-posedness results, the existence and the uniqueness, of CRFs in both Euclidean and hyperbolic background geometries. Moreover, we prove convergence results of CRFs, which indicate a uniformization theorem for CRFs on infinite disk triangulations. As an application, we prove an existence result of circle-packing metrics with infinite prescribed cone angles in hyperbolic background geometry. To our knowledge, these are the first results of CRFs on infinite triangulations.</description>

      <title>A construction of multiple group racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiple group rack is a rack which is a disjoint union of groups equipped with a binary operation satisfying some conditions. It is used to define invariants of spatial surfaces, i.e., oriented compact surfaces with boundaries embedded in the $3$-sphere $S^{3}$. A $G$-family of racks is a set with a family of binary operations indexed by the elements of a group $G$. There are two known methods for constructing multiple group racks. One is via a $G$-family of racks. The resulting multiple group rack is called the associated multiple group rack of the $G$-family of racks. The other is by taking an abelian extension of a multiple group rack. In this paper, we introduce a new method for constructing multiple group racks by using a $G$-family of racks and a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$. We show that this construction yields multiple group racks that are neither the associated multiple group racks of any $G$-family of racks nor their abelian extensions when the right conjugation action of $G$ on $N$ is nontrivial. As an application, we present a pair of spatial surfaces that cannot be distinguished by invariants derived from the associated multiple group racks of any $G$-family of racks, yet can be distinguished using invariants obtained from a multiple group rack introduced in this paper.</description>

      <title>Effective length-projection bounds for hyperbolic 3-manifolds diffeomorphic to $S\times\mathbb{R}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a formula with explicit constants relating the subsurface projection $d_Y(\nu^-,\nu^+)$ of the end invariants $\nu^-,\nu^+$ of a hyperbolic 3-manifold $Q$ diffeomorphic to $S\times\mathbb{R}$ and the length of the geodesic representative in $Q$ of the multicurve $\partial Y$. This makes effective and computable the large projections versus short curves relation proved by Minsky. We give an application to closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds fibering over the circle providing a geometric analog of the uniform projection bound in fibered faces of Minsky and Taylor.</description>

      <title>Positive 3-braids, Khovanov homology and Garside theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Khovanov homology is a powerful invariant of oriented links that categorifies the Jones polynomial. Nevertheless, computing Khovanov homology of a given link remains challenging in general with current techniques. In this work we focus on links that are the closure of positive 3-braids. Starting with a classification of conjugacy classes of 3-braids arising from the Garside structure of braid groups, we compute, for any closed positive 3-braid, the first four columns (homological degree) and the three lowest rows (quantum degree) of the associated Khovanov homology table. Moreover, the number of rows and columns we can describe increases with the infimum of the positive braid (a Garside theoretical notion). We will show how to increase the infimum of a 3-braid to its maximal possible value by a conjugation, maximizing the number of cells in the Khovanov homology of its closure that can be determined, and show that this can be done in linear time.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive scalar curvature, $R_g \geq 6$. We show that $M$ contains a non-trivial closed geodesic of length less than $22500$. This confirms a conjecture of M. Gromov in dimension $3$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for Quasi-Morphisms: Bounded Cohomology and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a compact negatively curved space, we develop a notion of thermodynamic formalism and apply it to study the space of quasi-morphisms of its fundamental group modulo boundedness. We prove that this space is Banach isomorphic to the space of Bowen functions corresponding to the associated Gromov geodesic flow, modulo a weak notion of Livsic cohomology.
  The results include that each such unbounded quasi-morphism is associated with a unique invariant measure for the flow, and this measure uniquely characterizes the cohomology class. As a consequence, we establish the Central Limit Theorem for any unbounded quasi-morphism with respect to Markov measures, the invariance principle, and the Bernoulli property of the associated equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>On Contact Round Surgeries on $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{st})$ and Their Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of contact round surgery of index 1 and 2, respectively, on Legendrian knots in $\left(\mathbb{S}^3, \xi_{st}\right)$ and associate diagrams to them. We realize Jiro Adachi's contact round surgeries as special cases. We show that every closed connected contact 3-manifold can be obtained by performing a sequence of contact round surgeries on some Legendrian link in $\left(\mathbb{S}^3, \xi_{st}\right)$, thus obtaining a contact round surgery diagram for each contact 3-manifold. This is analogous to a similar result of Ding and Geiges for contact Dehn surgeries. We discuss a bridge between certain pairs of contact round surgery diagrams of index 1 and 2 and contact $\pm1$-surgery diagrams. We use this bridge to establish the result mentioned above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate full exceptional sequences in Fukaya categories of surfaces or equivalently in derived categories of graded gentle algebras to branched coverings over the disk, building on a previous classification result of the first and third author. This allows us to apply tools from the theory of branched coverings such as Birman--Hilden theory and Hurwitz systems to study the natural braid group action on exceptional sequences. As an application, counterexamples are given to a conjecture of Bondal--Polishchuk on the transitivity of the braid group action on full exceptional sequences in a triangulated category.</description>

      <title>Local H-Principles for Partial Holomorphic Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of the realifications of an arbitrary \emph{partial holomorphic relation}. Our main result states that if any realification of an open partial holomorphic relation over a Stein manifold satisfies a relative to domain $h$--principle, then it is possible to deform any formal solution into one that is holonomic in a neighbourhood of a Lagrangian skeleton of the Stein manifold. If the Stein manifold is an open Riemann surface or it has finite type, then that skeleton is independent of the formal solution. This yields the existence of local $h$--principles over that skeleton. These results broaden those obtained by F. Forstneri\v{c} and M. Slapar on holomorphic immersions, submersions and complex contact structures for instance to holomorphic local $h$--principles for complex even contact, complex Engel or complex conformal symplectic structures.</description>

      <title>Towards the quantum exceptional series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a single two-parameter skein relation on trivalent graphs, the quantum exceptional relation, that specializes to a skein relation associated to each exceptional Lie algebra (in the adjoint representation). If a slight strengthening of Deligne's conjecture on the existence of a (classical) exceptional series is true, then this relation holds for a new two-variable quantum exceptional polynomial, at least as a power series near $q=1$. The single quantum exceptional relation can be viewed as a deformation of the Jacobi relation, and implies a deformation of the Vogel relation that motivated the conjecture on the classical exceptional series.
  We find a conjectural basis for the space of diagrams with $n$ loose ends modulo the quantum exceptional relation for $n \le 6$, with dimensions agreeing with the classical computations, and compute the matrix of inner products, and the quantum dimensions of idempotents. We use the skein relation to compute the conjectural quantum exceptional polynomial for many knots. In particular we determine (unconditionally) the values of the quantum polynomials for the exceptional Lie algebras on these knots. We can perform these computations for all links of Conway width less than $6$, which includes all prime knots with 12 or fewer crossings. Finally, we prove several specialization results relating our conjectural family to certain quantum group categories, and conjecture a number of exceptional analogues of level-rank duality.</description>
