      <title>Constant prediction and evasion number, I: Generalization and variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the concept of constant evasion to different sorts of suitable binary relations, we establish many cardinal invariants derived from the established cardinal invariants $\mathfrak{e}^\mathrm{const}_{n}$ and $\mathfrak{v}^\mathrm{const}_{n}$, called the constant evasion number and the constant prediction number. We formulate several limits and consistency results pertaining to them.</description>

      <title>The model theory of metric lattices: pseudofinite partition lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of general metric lattices in the context of the model theory of metric structures. As an application we develop a theory of pseudo-finite limits of partition lattices and connect this theory with the theory of continuous limits of partition lattices due to Bj\"orner and Lov\'asz.</description>

      <title>Tensor term logic for categorial grammars: simple unification of commutative and noncommutative structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A prototypical example of categorial grammars are those based on Lambek calculus, i.e. noncommutative intuitionistic linear logic. However, it has been noted that purely noncommutative operations are often not sufficient for modeling even very simple natural language phenomena. Therefore a number of alternative formalisms are considered in the literature: those using purely ``commutative'' linear logic as well as combining (to some level) commutative and non-commutative operations. The logic of tensor terms that we propose is a variant of such a combination. This logical calculus was designed specially for defining categorial grammars. It contains Lambek calculus and multiplicative linear logic as conservative fragments, yet the syntax is very simple, not departing much from that of multiplicative linear logic. The system is cut-free and decidable, it has both intuitionistic and classical versions, besides it is equipped with a simple intuitive semantics, which is sound and complete.</description>

      <title>Demystifying $\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01096v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the theory of illfounded and cyclic proofs for the propositional modal $\mu$-calculus. A fine analysis of provability for classical and intuitionistic modal logic provides a novel bridge between finitary, cyclic and illfounded conceptions of proof and re-enforces the importance of two normal form theorems for the logic: guardedness and disjunctiveness.</description>

      <title>Effective weak convergence and tightness of measures in computable Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prokhorov's Theorem in probability theory states that a family $\Gamma$ of probability measures on a Polish space is tight if and only if every sequence in $\Gamma$ has a weakly convergent subsequence. Due to the highly non-constructive nature of (relative) sequential compactness, however, the effective content of this theorem has not been studied. To this end, we generalize the effective notions of weak convergence of measures on the real line due to McNicholl and Rojas to computable Polish spaces. Then, we introduce an effective notion of tightness for families of measures on computable Polish spaces. Finally, we prove an effective version of Prokhorov's Theorem for computable sequences of probability measures.</description>
