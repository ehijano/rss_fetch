      <title>Parametrization of GPDs from t-channel string exchange in AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) that is valid for all skewness. Our approach leverages conformal moments, representing them as the sum of spin-j nucleon A-form factor and skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor, derived from t-channel string exchange in AdS spaces consistent with Lorentz invariance and unitarity. This model-independent framework, satisfying the polynomiality condition due to Lorentz invariance, uses Mellin moments from empirical data to estimate these form factors. With just five Regge slope parameters, our method accurately produces various nucleon quark GPD types and symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs through pertinent Mellin-Barnes integrals. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data, promising to improve the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, by avoiding the deconvolution problem at any skewness, for the first time.</description>

      <title>Probing QCD Axions or Axion-like Particles in three-body $K$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-body decays like $K \to \pi a$ rank among the most constraining collider probes for new, low-mass, feebly interacting pseudoscalar particles $a$. We explore an alternative class of kaon decay modes, specifically three-body decays to $\pi \pi a$ or $\mu \mu a$. The former occur at tree level, while the latter is loop-suppressed yet accidentally finite. These modes specifically leverage the accurate tracking capabilities at LHCb. We present an estimation approach for the sensitivity achievable in future searches within these channels. Our argument uses the current uncertainty in leading irreducible backgrounds identified for each channel. Our findings suggest that dedicated searches could probe $f_a$ scales between $10^4$ and $10^6$ TeV, highlighting their strong potential. A direct comparison with actual searches, only available in the $K^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0 a$ channel, supports this conclusion. Finally, we show that, in these searches, reconstruction efficiency maps are such that large efficiencies are naturally aligned with regions of higher yields in Dalitz plots.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Universal One-Loop Effective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive universal formulae for integrating out heavy degrees of freedom in scalar field theories up to one-loop level in terms of covariant quantities associated with the geometry of the field manifold. The universal matching results can be readily applied to phenomenologically interesting extensions of the Standard Model, as we demonstrate using a singlet scalar example. We also discuss the role of field redefinitions in effective field theory matching and simplifications resulting from going to a field basis where interactions are encoded in a nontrivial metric on the field manifold.</description>

      <title>Cosmic (super)strings with a time-varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic (super)strings offer promising ways to test ideas about the early universe and physics at high energies. While in field theory constructions their tension is usually assumed to be constant (or at most slowly-varying), this is often not the case in the context of String Theory. Indeed, the tensions of both fundamental and field theory strings within a string compactification depend on the expectation values of the moduli, which in turn can vary with time. We discuss how the evolution of a cosmic string network changes with a time-dependent tension, both for long-strings and closed loops, by providing an appropriate generalisation of the Velocity One Scale (VOS) model and its implications. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, exhibiting novel features such as growing loops, percolation and a radiation-like behaviour of the long string network. We conclude with a few remarks on the impact for gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Production During Reheating: From the Inflaton to Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational waves (GWs) produced by primordial black holes (PBHs) in the presence of the inflaton condensate in the early Universe. Combining the GW production from the evaporation process, the gravitational scattering of the inflaton itself, and the density fluctuations due to the inhomogeneous distribution of PBHs, we propose for the first time a complete coherent analysis of the spectrum, revealing three peaks, one for each source. Three frequency ranges ($\sim$ kHz, GHz, and PHz, respectively) are expected, each giving rise to a similar GW peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}$. We also compare our predictions with current and future GWs detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraining low scale Dark Hypercharge symmetry at spallation, reactor and Dark Matter direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus (CE$\nu$NS) and Elastic Neutrino-Electron Scattering (E$\nu$ES) data are exploited to constrain "chiral" $U(1)_{X}$ gauged models with light vector mediator mass. These models fall under a distinct class of new symmetries called Dark Hypercharge Symmetries. A key feature is the fact that the $Z'$ boson can couple to all Standard Model fermions at tree level, with the $U(1)_X$ charges determined by the requirement of anomaly cancellation. Notably, the charges of leptons and quarks can differ significantly depending on the specific anomaly cancellation solution. As a result, different models exhibit distinct phenomenological signatures and can be constrained through various experiments. In this work, we analyze the recent data from the COHERENT experiment, along with results from Dark Matter (DM) direct detection experiments such as XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, and PandaX-4T, and place new constraints on three benchmark models. Additionally, we set constraints from a performed analysis of TEXONO data and discuss the prospects of improvement in view of the next-generation DM direct detection DARWIN experiment.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Seebeck effect of the QGP medium using a novel relaxation time approximation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highly energetic particle medium formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision displays a notable difference in temperatures between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient can generate an electric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck effect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon plasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the kinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of individual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium, with the emphasis on its dependence on the temperature and the chemical potential. Our observation indicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases as the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases. Furthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the partonic interactions described in perturbative thermal QCD within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have presented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA model.</description>

      <title>Probing a $Z'$ gauge boson via neutrino trident scattering at the Forward Physics Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of neutrino physics at the Large Hadron Collider is already a reality, and a broad neutrino physics program is expected to be developed in forthcoming years at the Forward Physics Facility (FPF). In particular, the neutrino trident scattering process, which is a rare Standard Model process, is expected to be observed for the first time with a statistical significance of $5\sigma$ using the FASER$\nu$2 detector. Such a perspective motivates the investigation of the impact of New Physics on the predictions for the corresponding number of events. In this letter, we consider the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, which predicts an additional massive neutral gauge boson, $Z'$, that couples to neutrino and charged leptons of the second and third families, and estimate the production of a dimuon system in the neutrino trident scattering at the FASER$\nu$2 assuming different models for the incoming neutrino flux. We derive the associated sensitivity and demonstrate that a future measurement of the dimuons produced in neutrino trident events at the FPF will extend the coverage of the parameter space in comparison to previous experiments.</description>

      <title>Split Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral matter exhibits unique electromagnetic responses due to the macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly as anomalous transport currents. Here, we study the modification of electromagnetic radiation in isotropic chiral matter characterized by an axion coupling that varies linearly over time $\theta(t) = b_0 t$. Using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, we derive the causal Green's function to investigate the stability and radiation properties of the system. Even though the plane-wave modes of isotropic chiral matter exhibit imaginary frequencies for long wavelengths, which might suggest instability in the system, we show that their contribution is confined to the near-field region. Also we find no exponentially growing fields at arbitrarily large times, so that stability is preserved. Under these conditions the radiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent property of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we confirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for refractive indices $n &gt; 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric cones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed of the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and offers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz) light sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for analyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon plasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and accelerated charges.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray in light of the Lorentz Invariance Violation Effects within the Proton Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tiny LIV effects may origin from typical space-time structures in quantum gravity theories. So, it is reasonable to anticipate that tiny LIV effects can be present in the proton sector. We find that, with tiny LIV effects in the proton sector, the threshold energy of photon that can engage in the photopion interactions with protons can be pushed to much higher scales (of order 0.1 eV to 10^3 eV) in comparison with the case without LIV. Therefore, the proton specie in UHECRs can possibly travel a long distance without being attenuated by the photopion processes involving the CMB photons, possibly explain the observed beyond-GZK cut-off events. We also find that, when both the leading order and next leading order LIV effects are present, the higher order LIV terms can possibly lead to discontinuous GZK cut-off energy bands. Observation of beyond-GZK cut-off UHECR events involving protons can possibly constrain the scale of LIV. Such UHECR events can act as a exquisitely probe of LIV effects and shed new lights on the UV LIV theories near the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first bounds on GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, showing that these bounds surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that neural networks can be used to improve search strategies, over existing strategies, in LHC searches for light electroweak-charged scalars that decay to a muon and a heavy invisible fermion. We propose a new search involving a neural network discriminator as a final cut and show that different signal regions can be defined using networks trained on different subsets of signal samples (distinguishing low-mass and high-mass regions). We also present a workflow using publicly-available analysis tools, that can lead, from background and signal simulation, to network training, through to finding projections for limits using an analysis and ${\tt ONNX}$ libraries to interface network and recasting tools. We provide an estimate of the sensitivity of our search from Run 2 LHC data, and projections for higher luminosities, showing a clear advantage over previous methods.</description>

      <title>Probing CP-violating Higgs-gauge Boson Couplings at Future Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of future muon colliders to CP-violating interactions in the Higgs sector, specifically focusing on the process $\mu^- \mu^+ \to h \bar{\nu_{l}} \nu_{l}$. Using a model-independent approach within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the contribution of dimension-six operators to Higgs-gauge boson couplings, emphasizing CP-violating effects. To simulate the process, all signal and background events are generated through MadGraph. The analysis provides 95\% confidence level limits on the relevant Wilson coefficients $\tilde{c}_{HB}$, $\tilde{c}_{HW}$, $\tilde{c}_{\gamma}$, with a comparative discussion of existing experimental and phenomenological constraints. Our best constraints on the $\tilde{c}_{HB}$, $\tilde{c}_{HW}$, $\tilde{c}_{\gamma}$ with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$ are $[-0.017148;0.018711]$, $[-0.002545;0.002837]$ and $[-0.010613;0.011210]$, respectively. In this context, this study highlights the capability of future muon collider experiments to probe new physics in the Higgs sector, potentially offering tighter constraints on CP-violating Higgs-gauge boson interactions than those provided by current colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on the theoretical investigation of charged Higgs bosons and their coupling to fermions within the Two Higgs Doublet Model (THDM). The study focuses on the discovery potential of charged Higgs bosons predicted in Types III and IV at the future Circular Hadron-Hadron Collider (FCC-hh) with a center-of-mass energy of (\sqrt{s} = 100) TeV. By analyzing their decays, couplings to fermions, branching ratios, and production cross-section via (pp \rightarrow tH^-), we investigate the signatures of charged Higgs bosons, including kinematical distributions based on the background processes of (b\bar{b}) quarks.</description>

      <title>Berry phase in axion physics: implications for detection, SM global structure, and generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-gauge-boson and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in these two systems are shown to share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase. This approach offers a new perspective on certain axion experiments, including photon birefringence and storage-ring experiments. Additionally, we conceptually propose a novel photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase provides a unique way for probing the global structure of the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Search for Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings with $ZZ$ Production at Future Electron Positron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings (nTGCs) through $ZZ$ production at future electron-positron colliders. The impact of beam polarization on cross section is analyzed. We compare the signals and backgrounds for five different $ZZ$ decay channels and present our event selection strategies for future $e^+e^-$ colliders. The expected coefficient constraints for each decay channels are provided, and final expected constraints are derived by combining results from the different decay patterns. Our analysis indicates that future electron-positron colliders will have significantly enhanced detection capabilities for nTGCs compared to the current LHC experiments, with expected improvements in constraints by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) to investigate the impact of charge dequantization arising from non-local QED on the scale of non-locality of neutrinos. We find this scale to be &lt;= 87 TeV, which could be probed in future colliders. We also investigate the electric force and potential in non-local QED and use them to reformulate the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in non-local QED.</description>

      <title>Modular domain walls and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss modular domain walls and gravitational waves in a class of supersymmetric models where quark and lepton flavour symmetry emerges from modular symmetry. In such models a single modulus field $\tau$ is often assumed to be stabilised at or near certain fixed point values such as $\tau = {\rm i}$ and $\tau = \omega$ (the cube root of unity), in its fundamental domain. We show that, in the global supersymmetry limit of certain classes of potentials, the vacua at these fixed points may be degenerate, leading to the formation of modular domain walls in the early Universe. Taking supergravity effects into account, in the background of a fixed dilaton field $S$, the degeneracy may be lifted, leading to a bias term in the potential allowing the domain walls to collapse. We study the resulting gravitational wave spectra arising from the dynamics of such modular domain walls, and assess their observability by current and future experiments, as a window into modular flavour symmetry.</description>

      <title>Dispersion theory of nucleon (nucleus) Compton scattering spin polarizabilities and quasi-optical $\gamma$-ray polarization plane rotation and birefringence effect in a matter with polarized protons (nuclei)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental observation of quasi-optical phenomenon of $\gamma$-quanta polarization plane rotation in matter with polarized proton (nuclei) is demonstrated to be possible. This effect is similar to the magneto-optic Faraday effect (Faraday optical rotation). Quasi-optical birefringence effect for $\gamma$-quanta in matter with polarized nuclei having spin $S \ge 1$ could also be observed. The latter effect is similar to double refraction (birefringence) of light in uniaxial and biaxial crystals. The above phenomena open up possibility to investigate how spin vector and tensor polarizabilities depend on $\gamma$-quanta energy. In particular, studying the effect of $\gamma$-quanta polarization plane rotation, it is possible to find the range of $\gamma$-quanta energies, which is associated with strong dependence of spin polarizability on $\gamma$-quanta energy.</description>

      <title>How fast does the WallGo? A package for computing wall velocities in first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WallGo is an open source software for the computation of the bubble wall velocity in first-order cosmological phase transitions. It also computes the energy budget available for the generation of gravitational waves. The main part of WallGo, built in Python, determines the wall velocity by solving the scalar-field(s) equation of motion, the Boltzmann equations and energy-momentum conservation for the fluid velocity and temperature. WallGo also includes two auxiliary modules: WallGoMatrix, which computes matrix elements for out-of-equilibrium particles, and WallGoCollision, which performs higher-dimensional integrals for Boltzmann collision terms. Users can implement custom models by defining an effective potential and specifying a list of out-of-equilibrium particles and their interactions.
  As the first public software to compute the wall velocity including out-of-equilibrium contributions, WallGo improves the precision of the computation compared to common assumptions in earlier computations. It utilises a spectral method for the deviation from equilibrium and collision terms that provides exponential convergence in basis polynomials, and supports multiple out-of-equilibrium particles, allowing for Boltzmann mixing terms. WallGo is tailored for non-runaway wall scenarios where leading-order coupling effects dominate friction.
  While this work introduces the software and the underlying theory, a more detailed documentation can be found in https://wallgo.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>Superradiant growth anomaly magnification in evolution of vector bosonic condensates bounded by a Kerr black hole with near-horizon reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05108v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight vector particles can form evolving condensates around a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability. We study the effect of near-horizon reflection on the evolution of this system: by matching three pieces of asymptotic expansions of the Proca equation in Kerr metric and considering the leading order in the electric mode, we present explicit analytical expressions for the corrected spectrum and the superradiant instability rates. Particularly, in high-spin BH cases, we identify an anomalous situation where the superadiance rate is temporarily increased by the reflection parameter $\mathcal{R}$, which also occurs in the scalar scenario, but is largely magnified in vector condensates due to a faster growth rate in dominant mode. We point out the condition for the growth anomaly in the adiabatic case is that information carried per particle exceeds a certain value $\delta I/\delta N&gt;2\pi k_\text{B} \sqrt{(1+\mathcal{R})/(1-\mathcal{R})}$. We further construct several featured quantities to illustrate it, and formalize the anomaly-induced gravitational wave strain deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent direct detection of neutrinos at the LHC has opened a new window on high-energy particle physics and highlighted the potential of forward physics for groundbreaking discoveries. In the last year, the physics case for forward physics has continued to grow, and there has been extensive work on defining the Forward Physics Facility and its experiments to realize this physics potential in a timely and cost-effective manner. Following a 2-page Executive Summary, we present the status of the FPF, beginning with the FPF's unique potential to shed light on dark matter, new particles, neutrino physics, QCD, and astroparticle physics. We summarize the current designs for the Facility and its experiments, FASER2, FASER$\nu$2, FORMOSA, and FLArE, and conclude by discussing international partnerships and organization, and the FPF's schedule, budget, and technical coordination.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic and Computational Complexity in the Neutrino Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum magic in systems of dense neutrinos undergoing coherent flavor transformations, relevant for supernova and neutron-star binary mergers. Mapping the three-flavor-neutrino system to qutrits, the evolution of quantum magic is explored in the single scattering angle limit for a selection of initial tensor-product pure states for $N_\nu \le 8$ neutrinos. For $|\nu_e\rangle^{\otimes N_\nu}$ initial states, the magic, as measured by the $\alpha=2$ stabilizer Renyi entropy $M_2$, is found to decrease with radial distance from the neutrino sphere, reaching a value that lies below the maximum for tensor-product qutrit states. Further, the asymptotic magic per neutrino, $M_2/N_\nu$, decreases with increasing $N_\nu$. In contrast, the magic evolving from states containing all three flavors reaches values only possible with entanglement, with the asymptotic $M_2/N_\nu$ increasing with $N_\nu$. These results highlight the connection between the complexity in simulating quantum physical systems and the parameters of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Amplification of Chiral Gravitational Waves and the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, $D$-meson, $B$-meson, and nucleon physics with the aim of making them easily accessible to the nuclear and particle physics communities. More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor $f_+(0)$ arising in the semileptonic $K \to \pi$ transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay-constant ratio $f_K/f_\pi$ and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$. We review the determination of the $B_K$ parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four $B$ parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for $m_c$ and $m_b$ as well as those for the decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters of charmed and bottom mesons and baryons. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. We review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. We review the determinations of nucleon charges from the matrix elements of both isovector and flavour-diagonal axial, scalar and tensor local quark bilinears, and momentum fraction, helicity moment and the transversity moment from one-link quark bilinears. We also review determinations of scale-setting quantities. Finally, in this review we have added a new section on the general definition of the low-energy limit of the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: This document summarizes the discussions which took place during the PITT-PACC Workshop entitled "Non-Standard Cosmological Epochs and Expansion Histories," held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Sept. 5-7, 2024. Much like the non-standard cosmological epochs that were the subject of these discussions, the format of this workshop was also non-standard. Rather than consisting of a series of talks from participants, with each person presenting their own work, this workshop was instead organized around free-form discussion blocks, with each centered on a different overall theme and guided by a different set of Discussion Leaders. This document is not intended to serve as a comprehensive review of these topics, but rather as an informal record of the discussions that took place during the workshop, in the hope that the content and free-flowing spirit of these discussions may inspire new ideas and research directions.</description>

      <title>Nailing down the theoretical uncertainties of $\overline{\rm D}$ spectrum produced from dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of cosmic antideuterons ($\overline{\rm D}$) at kinetic energies below a few GeV/n could provide a smoking gun signature for dark matter (DM). However, the theoretical uncertainties of coalescence models have represented so far one of the main limiting factors for precise predictions of the $\overline{\rm D}$ flux. In this Letter we present a novel calculation of the $\overline{\rm D}$ source spectra, based on the Wigner formalism, for which we implement the Argonne $v_{18}$ antideuteron wavefunction that does not have any free parameters related to the coalescence process. We show that the Argonne Wigner model excellently reproduces the $\overline{\rm D}$ multiplicity measured by ALEPH at the $Z$-boson pole, which is usually adopted to tune the coalescence models based on different approaches. Our analysis is based on Pythia~8 Monte Carlo event generator and the state-of-the-art Vincia shower algorithm. We succeed, with our model, to reduce the current theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of the $\overline{\rm D}$ source spectra to a few percent, for $\overline{\rm D}$ kinetic energies relevant to DM searches with GAPS and AMS, and for DM masses above a few tens of GeV. This result implies that the theoretical uncertainties due to the coalescence process are no longer the main limiting factor in the predictions. We provide the tabulated source spectra for all the relevant DM annihilation/decay channels and DM masses between 5 GeV and 100 TeV, on the CosmiXs github repository (https://github.com/ajueid/CosmiXs.git).</description>

      <title>Lattice simulations of axion-U(1) inflation: gravitational waves, magnetic fields, and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study axion-U(1) inflation, focusing on the regime where the coupling between axions and gauge fields results in significant backreaction from the amplified gauge fields during inflation. These amplified gauge fields not only generate high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) but also induce spatial inhomogeneities in the axion field, which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Both GWs and PBHs serve as key probes for constraining the coupling strength between the axion and gauge fields. We find that, when backreaction is important during inflation, the constraints on the coupling strength due to GW overproduction are relaxed compared to previous studies, in which backreaction matters only after inflation. For PBH formation, understanding the probability density function (PDF) of axion field fluctuations is crucial. While earlier analytical studies assumed that these fluctuations followed a $\chi^2$-distribution, our results suggest that the PDF tends toward a Gaussian distribution in cases where gauge field backreaction is important, regardless whether during or after inflation. We also calculate the spectrum of the produced magnetic fields in this model and find that their strength is compatible with the observed lower limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute medium corrections to the energy-energy correlator (EEC) for jets in electron-nucleus collisions at leading order in the QCD coupling and the interaction of the jet with the medium. We derive an analytical expression for the modification of the EEC as a function of the opening angle and show that the modification is strongest at large angles within the jet cone. We obtain explicit results for the dependence of the modification on the jet energy, the scattering power of cold nuclear matter, and the path length within the medium. We extend our calculations to gluon jets in proton-nucleus collisions and compare our results with recent preliminary data for proton-lead collisions at the LHC. We also discuss the role of comovers on the EEC in p+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Causality in dissipative relativistic magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between linear and non-linear causality in theories of dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics. While for some fluid-dynamical theories, a linearized causality analysis can be used to determine whether the full non-linear theory is causal, for others it can not. As an illustration, we study relativistic viscous magnetohydrodynamics supplemented by a neutral-particle current, with resistive corrections to the conservation of magnetic flux. The dissipative theory has 10 transport coefficients, including anisotropic viscosities, electric resistivities, and neutral-particle conductivities. We show how causality properties of this magnetohydrodynamic theory, in the most general fluid frame, may be understood from the linearized analysis.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the equation-of-state from low energy heavy-ion collisions within the PHQMD microscopic approach with momentum-dependent potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the equation-of-state (EoS) of nuclear matter on collective observables, the directed ($v_1$) and the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of nucleons and light clusters in heavy-ion collisions at GeV beam energies employing the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) microscopic transport approach. Here the clusters are formed dynamically during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interaction between nucleons, including additionally deuteron production by hadronic kinetic reactions. We employ three different EoS - realized via potential interactions: two static EoS, dubbed 'soft' and 'hard', which differ in the compressibility modulus, as well as a soft momentum dependent EoS, adjusted to pA elastic scattering data. We find that the momentum dependent potential has different consequences for rapidity and transverse momentum spectra than for flow coefficients. We obtain the best description of the HADES and FOPI data on the directed and elliptic flow coefficients of protons and light clusters applying a momentum dependent EoS. Moreover, we observe a scaling behavior of $v_2$ versus $p_T$ with atomic number $A$. Finally we demonstrate that flow observables can help to identify the cluster production mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision measurements of diboson production at the LHC is an important probe of the limits of the Standard Model. The gluon-fusion channel of this process offers a connection between the Higgs and top sectors. We study in a systematic way gluon-induced diboson production in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. We compute the amplitudes of double Higgs, double $Z/W$ and associated $ZH$ production at one loop and with up to one insertion of a dimension-6 operator. We study their high-energy limit and identify to which operators each channel could be most sensitive. To illustrate the relevance of these processes, we perform a phenomenological study of associated $ZH$ production. We show that for some top operators the gluon-induced channel can offer competitive sensitivity to constraints obtained from top quark production processes.</description>

      <title>Probing protoneutron stars with gamma-ray axionscopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to nucleons can be efficiently produced in the interior of protoneutron stars (PNS) during supernova (SN) explosions. If these ALPs are also coupled to photons they can convert into gamma rays in the Galactic magnetic field. This SN-induced gamma-ray burst can be observable by gamma-ray telescopes like ${\textit Fermi}$-LAT if the SN is in the field of view of the detector. We show that the observable gamma-ray spectrum is sensitive to the production processes in the SN core. In particular, if the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung is the dominant axion production channel, one expects a thermal spectrum with average energy $E_a \simeq 50$ MeV. In this case the gamma-ray spectrum observation allows for the reconstruction of the PNS temperature. In case of a sizable pion abundance in the SN core, one expects a second spectral component peaked at $E_a\simeq 200$ MeV due to axion pionic processes. We demonstrate that, through a dedicated LAT analysis, we can detect the presence of this pionic contribution, showing that the detection of the spectral shape of the gamma-ray signal represents a unique probe of the pion abundance in the PNS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars: Bremsstrahlung and modified urca rates reexamined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars is dominated by the modified urca (murca) process and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. The standard emission rates were provided by Friman and Maxwell in 1979, effectively based on a chiral Lagrangian framework with pion and rho meson exchange, supplemented by Landau parameters to describe short-range interactions. We reevaluate these rates within the same framework, correcting several errors and removing unnecessary simplifications, notably the triangular approximation - where the Fermi momenta of protons and leptons negligible compared to that of neutrons - in MURCA, and quantify their importance. The impact of rho meson exchange, previously argued to cancel with interference effects, is actually quite relevant. Altogether, the cooling rates are reduced by as much as a factor 2. We provide comprehensive analytical formulas encompassing all contributions, designed for straightforward numerical implementation. Our results are particularly relevant for studies of physics beyond the standard model, where the emission of new particles - such as axions - is typically computed within the same framework we adopt here.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Raining on DUNE and Other Large Volume Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detection is a powerful means of searching for particle physics evidence of dark matter (DM) heavier than about a GeV with $\mathcal O(kiloton)$ volume, low-threshold detectors. In many scenarios, some fraction of the DM may be boosted to large velocities enhancing and generally modifying possible detection signatures. We investigate the scenario where 100% of the DM is boosted at the Earth due to new attractive long-range forces. This leads to two main improvements in detection capabilities: 1) the large boost allows for detectable signatures of DM well below a GeV at large-volume neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and JUNO, as possible DM detectors, and 2) the flux at the Earth's surface is enhanced by a focusing effect. In addition, the model leads to a significant anisotropy in the signal with the DM flowing dominantly vertically at the Earth's surface instead of the typical approximately isotropic DM signal. We develop the theory behind this model and also calculate realistic constraints using a detailed GENIE simulation of the signal inside detectors.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Masses and Leptogenesis in the CP-Violating Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, neutrino masses and leptogenesis are analyzed within the framework of an analytically solvable, CP-violating Standard Model (CPVSM).
  By utilizing the two experimentally given mass-squared differences (MSDs), denoted as $\Delta_a$ and $\Delta_b$, the third MSD is derived, enabling predictions of possible neutrino mass ranges, with mass ratios as key variables. Once all three MSDs are determined, leptogenesis in the model is predicted by applying Jarlskog's measure of CP violation, $\Delta_{CP(\ell)}$.
  The current value of leptogenesis is found to be approximately 71 orders of magnitude smaller than baryogenesis within this framework. Moreover, the CPVSM predicts a degeneracy between two of the three fermion generations as the parameter $\bf C$ approaches zero. When the parameter $\bf B$ also vanishes, an $S_3$ symmetry is emerged across all three generations. This suggests that the mass splitting among the generations may have resulted from a sequence of $S_N$ symmetry-breaking events in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Through the Looking Glass into the Dark Dimension: Searching for Bulk Black Hole Dark Matter with Microlensing of X-ray Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) hidden in the incredible bulk of the dark dimension could escape constraints from non-observation of their Hawking radiation. Since these five-dimensional (5D) PBHs are bigger, colder, and longer-lived than usual 4D PBHs of the same mass $M$, they could make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$, i.e., extending the 4D allowed region far down the asteroid-mass window. We show that these evasive PBHs could be search for by measuring their $X$-ray microlensing events from faraway pulsars. We also show that future $X$-ray microlensing experiments will be able to probe the interesting range ($10^{16.5} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{17.5}~{\rm g}$) where an all dark matter interpretation in terms of 4D Schwarzschild PBHs is excluded by the non-observation of their Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>On Extracting Thermal Parameters and Scenario in High-Energy Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this minireview article, we examine the inconsistent results of thermal parameters derived from various models in high-energy collisions. Through a comprehensive literature review and based on the average transverse momentum or the root-mean-square transverse momentum, we propose model-independent parameters to address these inconsistencies. The relevant parameters include: the initial temperature, the effective temperature, the kinetic freeze-out temperature, and the average transverse velocity. Our findings indicate that these four parameters are larger in central collisions, within central rapidity regions, at higher energies, and in larger collision systems. As collision energy increases, excitation functions for all four parameters rise rapidly (slowly) within ranges below (above) approximately 7.7 GeV. At higher energies (&gt;39) GeV, fluctuations occur in trends for these excitation functions, with only slight changes observed in their growth rates. Additionally, this work reveals a mass-dependent multi-temperature scenario pertaining to both initial states and kinetic freeze-out processes.</description>

      <title>Production and decay of anticharmed pentaquark state with quark content $\bar{c}sudd$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We used an effective Lagrangian approach to investigate the production of the anticharmed pentaquark state $P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-}$ with the minimal quark content $\bar{c}sudd$ in the $\Lambda_b^0$ decay and its decay into the $\Lambda D^{(\ast)-}$ and $\Sigma D^{(\ast)-}$. In our calculation, the $P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-}$ is considered as the molecule state of the $nD_{s0(s1)}^{-}$ in an $S$ wave, and its production and decay occur via triangle loops at the hadron level. The predicted branching fractions for the processes $\Lambda_b^0\to P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-} D^+ $ are around $10^{-4}\sim 10^{-3}$. The partial decay widths of the $ P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-} \to \Lambda D^{(\ast)-}$ are between $0.1$ and $\sim 10~\mathrm{MeV}$, whereas the decay widths of the $ P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-} \to \Sigma D^{(\ast)-}$ are about one order of magnitude smaller. It is found that the width ratios for the $P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-}$ decays are nearly independent of the model parameter $\alpha$. It is hoped that these predictions could be helpful in searching for the anticharmed-strange pentaquark candidates in future LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraints on ultra-slow-roll inflation with the NANOGrav 15-Year Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-slow-roll~(USR) inflation predicts an exponential amplification of scalar perturbations at small scales, which leads to a stochastic gravitational wave background~(SGWB) through the coupling of the scalar and tensor modes at the second-order expansion of the Einstein equation. In this work, we search for such a scalar-induced SGWB from the NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) dataset, and find that the SGWB from USR inflation could explain the observed data. The Bayes factors are $54\pm 5$ for the USR inflation model alone and $68\pm 6$ for the combined USR inflation plus supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) models. We place constraints on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum to $P_{\mathrm{Rp}} &gt; 10^{-1.95}$ at $95\%$ confidence level (C.L.) at the scale of $k\sim 20\, \mathrm{pc}^{-1}$. We find that $\log_{10} P_{\mathrm{Rp}}$ degenerates with the peak scale $\log_{10} k_{\mathrm{p}}$. We also obtain the parameter space allowed by the data in the USR inflationary scenario, where the $e$-folding numbers of the duration of the USR phase has a lower limit $\Delta N &gt; 2.80$ ($95\%$ C.L.) when the USR phase ends at $N\approx 20$. With astrophysically motivated priors, the NG15 dataset fits both the USR inflation model and SMBHB model equally well.</description>

      <title>Secondary Vertex Reconstruction with MaskFormers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy particle collisions, the reconstruction of secondary vertices from heavy-flavour hadron decays is crucial for identifying and studying jets initiated by $b$- or $c$-quarks. Traditional methods, while effective, require extensive manual optimisation and struggle to perform consistently across wide regions of phase space. Meanwhile, recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance but are unable to fully reconstruct multiple vertices. In this work we propose a novel approach to secondary vertex reconstruction based on recent advancements in object detection and computer vision. Our method directly predicts the presence and properties of an arbitrary number of vertices in a single model. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing techniques. Applied to simulated proton-proton collision events, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in vertex finding efficiency, achieving a 10% improvement over an existing state-of-the-art method. Moreover, it enables vertex fitting, providing accurate estimates of key vertex properties such as transverse momentum, radial flight distance, and angular displacement from the jet axis. When integrated into a flavour tagging pipeline, our method yields a 50% improvement in light-jet rejection and a 15% improvement in $c$-jet rejection at a $b$-jet selection efficiency of 70%. These results demonstrate the potential of adapting advanced object detection techniques for particle physics, and pave the way for more powerful and flexible reconstruction tools in high-energy physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Imaging Shapes of Atomic Nuclei in High-Energy Nuclear Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic nuclei are self-organized, many-body quantum systems bound by strong nuclear forces within femtometer-scale space. These complex systems manifest a variety of shapes, traditionally explored using non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies. However, at these energies, their instantaneous shapes are obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, making direct observation challenging. Here we introduce the ``collective flow assisted nuclear shape imaging'' method, which images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analyzing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution within the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, imprints patterns on the particle momentum distribution observed in detectors. We benchmark this method in collisions of ground state Uranium-238 nuclei, known for their elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings show a large deformation with a slight deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state, aligning broadly with previous low-energy experiments. This approach offers a new method for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances our understanding of the initial conditions in high-energy collisions and addresses the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across energy scales.</description>

      <title>Generalized Models for Inflationary Preheating: Oscillations and Symmetries</title>

Abstract: The paradigm of the inflationary universe provides a possible explanation for several observed cosmological properties. In order for such solutions to be successful, the universe must convert the energy stored in the inflaton potential into standard model particles through a process known as reheating. In this paper, we reconsider the reheating process for the case where the inflaton potential respects an approximate (but spontaneously broken) conformal symmetry during the reheating epoch. After reviewing the Effective Field Theory of Reheating, we present solutions for the nonlinear oscillations of the inflaton field, derive the corresponding Hill's equation for the coupled reheating field, and determine the stability diagram for parametric resonance. For this class of models -- the simplest realization being a scalar field with a quartic term -- the expansion of the universe drives the coupled field toward a more unstable part of parameter space, in contrast to the standard case. We also generalize this class of models to include quadratic breaking terms in the potential during the reheating epoch and address the process of stability in that universality class of models.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of Quantum Entanglement in Heavy Ion Collisions through Elliptic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between initial spatial anisotropy and final state momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions through the analysis of elliptic flow ($\nu_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). Building upon previous studies on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using transverse momentum distributions, we extend the analysis to the $p_T$ dependence of $\nu_2$ in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. By employing a two-component model to extract the thermal and hard scattering contributions to the elliptic flow, we aim to gain further insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the rapid thermalization and collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <title>Bulk Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark dimension provides a mechanism to resolve the cosmological hierarchy problem and assembles a colosseum for dark matter contenders. In a series of recent publications we investigated whether primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. A key assumption of these investigations is that PBHs remain confined to the brane during the entire evaporation process. As a consequence, the abundance of PBHs evaporating at the present epoch is severely constrained by observations of both the extragalactic and Galactic $\gamma$-ray backgrounds. As a natural outgrowth of these investigations, herein we relax the assumption of brane localized PBHs and reexamine the evaporation process of PBHs which are allowed to escape into the dark dimension. We show that the escape of PBHs from the brane is almost instantaneous. Armed with this pivotal finding we reassess the allowed mass range of PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter, which is estimated to be $10^{11} \lesssim M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$.</description>

      <title>On the electron self-energy to three loops in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the electron self-energy in Quantum Electrodynamics to three loops in terms of iterated integrals over kernels of elliptic type. We make use of the differential equations method, augmented by an $\epsilon$-factorized basis, which allows us to gain full control over the differential forms appearing in the iterated integrals to all orders in the dimensional regulator. We obtain compact analytic expressions, for which we provide generalized series expansion representations that allow us to evaluate the result numerically for all values of the electron momentum squared. As a by product, we also obtain $\epsilon$-resummed results for the self-energy in the on-shell limit $p^2 = m^2$, which we use to recompute the known three-loop renormalization constants in the on-shell scheme.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratios for locating a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>Proton decay in de Sitter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of proton in the de Sitter environment is governed by the temperature $T=H/\pi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This temperature is twice larger than the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. The demonstrates the physical difference of two processes. The temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the proton decay rate in the local process which takes well inside the cosmological horizon. While the Gibbons-Hawking temperature can be related to the processes which involve the Hawking photons or other particles radiated from the cosmological horizon. The lesson for the Unruh effect is discussed. One may expect the similar separation of effects governed by two different temperatures: the effects related to the Rindler horizon with the Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=a/2\pi$ and the local radiation with $T=a/\pi=2T_{\rm U}$.</description>
