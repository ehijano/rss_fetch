      <title>Local magnetic response of superconducting Sr$\mathrm{_2}$RuO$\mathrm{_4}$ thin films and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct local magnetic measurements on superconducting thin-film samples of Sr$\mathrm{_2}$RuO$\mathrm{_4}$ using scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) susceptometry. From the diamagnetic response, we extract the magnetic penetration depth, $\lambda$, which exhibits a quadratic temperature dependence at low temperatures. Although a quadratic dependence in high-purity bulk samples has been attributed to non-local electrodynamics, our analysis suggests that in our thin-film samples the presence of scattering is the origin of the quadratic dependence. While we observe micron-scale variations in the diamagnetic response and superconducting transition temperature, the form of the temperature dependence of $\lambda$ is independent of position. Finally, we characterize flux trapping in superconducting rings lithographically fabricated from the thin films, paving the way to systematic device-based tests of the superconducting order parameter in Sr$\mathrm{_2}$RuO$\mathrm{_4}$.</description>

      <title>Theory of tunneling spectroscopy in $p$-wave altermagnet-superconductor hybrid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional $p$-wave altermagnet (AM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing states. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are robust against varying the altermagnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a $p$-wave AM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing states of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of AM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shift in Andreev reflection from side incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andreev reflection at a normal-superconductor interface may be accompanied with an anomalous spatial shift. The studies so far are limited to the top incidence configuration. Here, we investigate this effect in the side incidence configuration, with the interface parallel to the principal axis of superconductor. We find that the shift exhibits rich behaviors reflecting the character of pair potential. It has two contributions: one from the $k$-dependent phase of pair potential, and the other from the evanescent mode. For chiral $p$-wave pairing, the pairing phase contribution is proportional to the chirality of pairing and is independent of excitation energy, whereas the evanescent mode contribution is independent of chirality and is nonzero only for excitation energy below the gap. The two contributions also have opposite parity with respect to the incident angle. For $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing, only the evanescent mode contribution exists, and the shift exhibits suppressed zones in incident angles, manifesting the superconducting nodes. The dependence of the shift on other factors, such as the angle of incident plane and Fermi surface anisotropy, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Microscopic Mechanism of Elementary Vortex Pinning in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex pinning is a crucial factor that determines the critical current of practical superconductors. However, the understanding of its underlying mechanism has long been phenomenological without a clear microscopic description. Here using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we studied single vortex pinning induced by point defect in layered FeSe-based superconductors. We found the defect-vortex interaction drives low-energy vortex bound states away from EF, resulting a mini gap which effectively lowered the energy of vortex and caused the pinning. By measuring the local density-of-states, we directly obtained the elementary pinning energy and estimated the pinning force through the spatial gradient of pinning energy. The results align with the bulk critical current measurement. We further show that a general microscopic quantum model with considering defect-vortex interaction can well capture our observation. It indicates the local pairing near pinned vortex core is actually enhanced, which is beyond the traditional understanding that non-superconducting regions pin vortices. Our study thus revealed a general microscopic mechanism of vortex pinning in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anomalous supercurrent and diode effect in locally perturbed topological Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry can lead to peculiar effects in Josephson junctions, such as the anomalous Josephson effect or supercurrent rectification, which is a dissipationless analog of the diode effect. Due to their impact in new quantum technologies, it is important to find robust platforms and external means to manipulate the above effects in a controlled way. Here, we theoretically consider a quantum spin Hall-based Josephson junction subjected to a magnetic field in the direction defined by spin-momentum locking, and in presence of a local tip in close proximity to the normal region. We consider different local perturbations, model normal and magnetic tips, and study how they affect the Josephson response of the device. In particular, we argue that magnetic tips are a useful tool that allows for tunability of both $\phi_0$ response and supercurrent rectification.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and superconductivity in a multiorbital t-J model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by exploring doped multi-orbital antiferromagnets (AFMs) and altermagnets (ALMs) we explore minimal $t$-$J$ models on the square-octagon lattice which favor such collinear magnetic orders in the regime where spin exchange dominates. While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent nuclear energy-density functional theory toolkit for neutron star crust: Dynamics of a nucleus in a neutron superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new numerical tool designed to probe the dense layers of neutron star crusts. It is based on the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with generalized Skyrme nuclear energy density functionals, such as the Brussels-Montreal ones. We use it to study the time evolution of a nucleus accelerating through superfluid neutron medium in the inner crust of a neutron star. We extract an effective mass in the low velocity limit. We observe a threshold velocity and specify mechanisms of dissipation: phonon emission, Cooper pairs breaking, and vortex rings creation. The microscopic effects we study have impact on neutron star. Moreover, the mechanisms, we described, are general and apply also to other fermionic superfluid mixtures like liquid helium, or ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Determination of the dynamic Young's modulus of quantum materials in piezoactuator-driven uniaxial pressure cells using a low-frequency a.c. method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a new technique for measuring the dynamic Young's modulus, $E$, of quantum materials at low temperatures as a function of static tuning strain, $\epsilon$, in piezoactuator-driven pressure cells. In addition to a static tuning of stress and strain, we apply a small-amplitude, finite-frequency a.c. (1 Hz$ \lesssim \omega \lesssim $1000 Hz) uniaxial stress, $\sigma_{ac}$, to the sample and measure the resulting a.c. strain, $\epsilon_{ac}$, using a capacitive sensor to obtain the associated modulus $E$. We demonstrate the performance of the new technique through proof-of-principle experiments on the unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is known for its rich temperature-strain phase diagram. In particular, we show that the magnitude of $E$, measured using this a.c. technique at low frequencies, exhibits a pronounced nonlinear elasticity, which is in very good agreement with previous Young's modulus measurements on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under [100] strain using a d.c. method (Noad et al., Science 382, 447-450 (2023)). By combining the new a.c. Young's modulus measurements with a.c. elastocaloric measurements in a single measurement, we demonstrate that these a.c. techniques are powerful in detecting small anomalies in the elastic properties of quantum materials. Finally, using the case of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as an example, we demonstrate how the imaginary component of the modulus can provide additional information about the nature of ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Dirac Dispersions and Fermi Surface Nesting in LaAgSb$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LaCuSb$_{2}$ is a superconductor with a transition temperature of about $T_\text{c} = 0.9$K and is a potential platform where Dirac fermions can be experimentally observed. In this paper, we report systematic high-resolution studies of its electronic structure using the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) technique supported by the DFT calculation. The Fermi surface consists of four branches, of which the two inner ones are more 3-dimensional and the theoretical calculations reproduce well the experiment. We observe several linear dispersions forming Dirac-like structures. The nodal lines are present in the system along ${\text{M}}$-${\text{A}}$ and ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ and Dirac crossings along ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ are observed by ARPES. Finally, the nesting between external Fermi surface pockets, which corresponds to charge density wave (CDW) modulation vector is enhanced in LaCuSb$_{2}$ as compared to LaAgSb$_{2}$, while CDW appears in the latter system.</description>

      <title>Structural phase transition, $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and magnetic stripe order in the bilayered nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15276v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we comprehensively study this system using density functional theory and random phase approximation calculations. At low pressures, the Amam phase is stable, containing the Y$^{2-}$ mode distortion from the Fmmm phase, while the Fmmm phase is unstable. Because of small differences in enthalpy and a considerable Y$^{2-}$ mode amplitude, the two phases may coexist in the range between 10.6 and 14 GPa, beyond which the Fmmm phase dominates. In addition, the magnetic stripe-type spin order with wavevector ($\pi$, 0) was stable at the intermediate region. Pairing is induced in the $s_{\pm}$-wave channel due to partial nesting between the {\bf M}=$(\pi, \pi)$ centered pockets and portions of the Fermi surface centered at the {\bf X}=$(\pi, 0)$ and {\bf Y}=$(0, \pi)$ points. This resembles results for iron-based superconductors but has a fundamental difference with iron pnictides and selenides. Moreover, our present efforts also suggest that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is qualitatively different from infinite-layer nickelates and cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electronic Phase Propagation Speed in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ Revealed by Dilatometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal expansion offers deep insights into phase transitions in condensed matter physics. Utilizing an advanced AC-temperature dilatometer with picometer resolution, this study clearly resolves the antiferromagnetic and structural transition in BaFe$_2$As$_2$. The implementation of temperature oscillation reveals a hysteresis near the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{N}$ with unprecedented resolution. Unexpectedly, we find that the hysteretic width exhibits a universal dependence on the parameters of temperature oscillation and the sample's longidutinal dimension, which in turn reveals a finite transition speed. Our quantitative analysis shows that this phase boundary propagates at a mere 188 $\mu$m/s - a speed seven orders of magnitude slower than acoustic waves. It suggests a hidden thermodynamic constraint imposed by the electronic degrees of freedom. Our research not only sheds light on the dynamics of phase transitions between different correlated phases, but also establishes high precision dilatometry as a powerful tool for material studies. This measurement technique, when properly modified, can be extended to studies of other material properties such as piezoelectric, magneto-restriction, elastic modulus, etc.</description>

      <title>Prediction of $s^\pm$-wave superconductivity enhanced by electronic doping in trilayer nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently reported signatures of superconductivity in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure, we comprehensively study this system using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Without electronic interactions, the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals show a bonding-antibonding and nonbonding splitting behavior via the O $p_z$ orbitals inducing a ``trimer'' lattice in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, analogous to the dimers of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. The Fermi surface consists of three electron sheets with mixed $e_g$ orbitals, and a hole and an electron pocket made up of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, suggesting a Ni two-orbital minimum model. In addition, we find that superconducting pairing is induced in the $s^{\pm}$-wave channel due to partial nesting between the {\bf M}=$(\pi, \pi)$ centered pockets and portions of the Fermi surface centered at the {\bf $\Gamma$}=$(0, 0)$ point. With changing electronic density $n$, the $s^\pm$ instability remains leading and its pairing strength shows a dome-like behavior with a maximum around $n = 4.2$ ($\sim 6.7\%$ electron doping). The superconducting instability disappears at the same electronic density as that in the new 1313 stacking La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, correlated with the vanishing of the hole pocket that arises from the trilayer sublattice, suggesting that the high-$T_c$ superconductivity of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may $not$ originate from a trilayer- and single-layer structure. Furthermore, we predict an interesting spin-density-wave state in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with an in-plane ($\pi$, $\pi$) order and antiferromagnetic coupling between the top and bottom Ni layers, while the middle layer has spin zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO$_2$ (R= rare-earth), and the subsequent enhancement of their T$_c$ with pressure, we investigate the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this family of materials via first-principles calculations employing hydrostatic and chemical pressure as tuning knobs. Overall, our analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect, as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of $J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>NbTi: a nontrivial puzzle for the conventional theory of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first $ab$-$initio$ study of superconductivity in NbTi, the workhorse for many applications. Despite its apparent simplicity, NbTi turns out to be a major challenge for computational superconductivity. In fact, anharmonic effects are crucial to obtain dynamically stable phonons for the ordered bcc phase, unstable at the harmonic level, and beyond-Morel Anderson effects in the Coulomb interaction reduce the Tc by more than 20%. Lattice disorder causes an additional large discrepancy in $T_c$ compared to experiment. Our results imply that a quantitative description of technologically-relevant superconductors requires methodological developments beyond the current standards.</description>
