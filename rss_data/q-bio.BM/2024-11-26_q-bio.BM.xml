      <title>SPRINT Enables Interpretable and Ultra-Fast Virtual Screening against Thousands of Proteomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual screening of small molecules against protein targets can accelerate drug discovery and development by predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs). However, structure-based methods like molecular docking are too slow to allow for broad proteome-scale screens, limiting their application in screening for off-target effects or new molecular mechanisms. Recently, vector-based methods using protein language models (PLMs) have emerged as a complementary approach that bypasses explicit 3D structure modeling. Here, we develop SPRINT, a vector-based approach for screening entire chemical libraries against whole proteomes for DTIs and novel mechanisms of action. SPRINT improves on prior work by using a self-attention based architecture and structure-aware PLMs to learn drug-target co-embeddings for binder prediction, search, and retrieval. SPRINT achieves SOTA enrichment factors in virtual screening on LIT-PCBA and DTI classification benchmarks, while providing interpretability in the form of residue-level attention maps. In addition to being both accurate and interpretable, SPRINT is ultra-fast: querying the whole human proteome against the ENAMINE Real Database (6.7B drugs) for the 100 most likely binders per protein takes 16 minutes. SPRINT promises to enable virtual screening at an unprecedented scale, opening up new opportunities for in silico drug repurposing and development. SPRINT is available on the web as ColabScreen: https://bit.ly/colab-screen</description>

      <title>Accelerated Hydration Site Localization and Thermodynamic Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water plays a fundamental role in the structure and function of proteins and other biomolecules. The thermodynamic profile of water molecules surrounding a protein are critical for ligand binding and recognition. Therefore, identifying the location and thermodynamic behavior of relevant water molecules is important for generating and optimizing lead compounds for affinity and selectivity to a given target. Computational methods have been developed to identify these hydration sites, but are largely limited to simplified models that fail to capture multi-body interactions, or dynamics-based methods that rely on extensive sampling. Here we present a method for fast and accurate localization and thermodynamic profiling of hydration sites for protein structures. The method is based on a geometric deep neural network trained on a large, novel dataset of explicit water molecular dynamics simulations. We confirm the accuracy and robustness of our model on experimental data and demonstrate it's utility on several case studies.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Complex Multiplexed DIA Spectra in De Novo Peptide Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) was introduced to improve sensitivity to cover all peptides in a range rather than only sampling high-intensity peaks as in Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry. However, it is not very clear how useful DIA data is for de novo peptide sequencing as the DIA data are marred with coeluted peptides, high noises, and varying data quality. We present a new deep learning method DIANovo, and address each of these difficulties, and improves the previous established system DeepNovo-DIA by from 25% to 81%, averaging 48%, for amino acid recall, and by from 27% to 89%, averaging 57%, for peptide recall, by equipping the model with a deeper understanding of coeluted DIA spectra. This paper also provides criteria about when DIA data could be used for de novo peptide sequencing and when not to by providing a comparison between DDA and DIA, in both de novo and database search mode. We find that while DIA excels with narrow isolation windows on older-generation instruments, it loses its advantage with wider windows. However, with Orbitrap Astral, DIA consistently outperforms DDA due to narrow window mode enabled. We also provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon, emphasizing the critical role of the signal-to-noise profile in the successful application of de novo sequencing.</description>

      <title>Impact of gas background on XFEL single-particle imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-particle imaging (SPI) using X-ray free-electron Lasers (XFELs) offers the potential to determine protein structures at high spatial and temporal resolutions without the need for crystallization or vitrification. However, the technique faces challenges due to weak diffraction signals from single proteins and significant background scattering from gases used for sample delivery. A recent observation of a diffraction pattern from an isolated GroEL protein complex had similar numbers of signal and background photons. Ongoing efforts aim to reduce the background created by sample delivery, with one approach replacing most of the used gas with helium. In this study, we investigate the effects of a potentially reduced background on the resolution limits for SPI of isolated proteins under different experiment conditions. As a test case, we used GroEL, and we used experimentally measured parameters for our simulations. We observe that background significantly impacts the achievable resolution, particularly when the signal strength is comparable to the background, and a background reduction would lead to a significant improvement in resolution.</description>

      <title>Balancing property optimization and constraint satisfaction for constrained multi-property molecular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular optimization, which aims to discover improved molecules from a vast chemical search space, is a critical step in chemical development. Various artificial intelligence technologies have demonstrated high effectiveness and efficiency on molecular optimization tasks. However, few of these technologies focus on balancing property optimization with constraint satisfaction, making it difficult to obtain high-quality molecules that not only possess desirable properties but also meet various constraints. To address this issue, we propose a constrained multi-property molecular optimization framework (CMOMO), which is a flexible and efficient method to simultaneously optimize multiple molecular properties while satisfying several drug-like constraints. CMOMO improves multiple properties of molecules with constraints based on dynamic cooperative optimization, which dynamically handles the constraints across various scenarios. Besides, CMOMO evaluates multiple properties within discrete chemical spaces cooperatively with the evolution of molecules within an implicit molecular space to guide the evolutionary search. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed CMOMO over five state-of-the-art molecular optimization methods on two benchmark tasks of simultaneously optimizing multiple non-biological activity properties while satisfying two structural constraints. Furthermore, the practical applicability of CMOMO is verified on two practical tasks, where it identified a collection of candidate ligands of $\beta$2-adrenoceptor GPCR and candidate inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$ with high properties and under drug-like constraints.</description>

      <title>M2oE: Multimodal Collaborative Expert Peptide Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peptides are biomolecules comprised of amino acids that play an important role in our body. In recent years, peptides have received extensive attention in drug design and synthesis, and peptide prediction tasks help us better search for functional peptides. Typically, we use the primary sequence and structural information of peptides for model encoding. However, recent studies have focused more on single-modal information (structure or sequence) for prediction without multi-modal approaches. We found that single-modal models are not good at handling datasets with less information in that particular modality. Therefore, this paper proposes the M2oE multi-modal collaborative expert peptide model. Based on previous work, by integrating sequence and spatial structural information, employing expert model and Cross-Attention Mechanism, the model's capabilities are balanced and improved. Experimental results indicate that the M2oE model performs excellently in complex task predictions.</description>

      <title>S$^2$ALM: Sequence-Structure Pre-trained Large Language Model for Comprehensive Antibody Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antibodies safeguard our health through their precise and potent binding to specific antigens, demonstrating promising therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of numerous diseases, including COVID-19. Recent advancements in biomedical language models have shown the great potential to interpret complex biological structures and functions. However, existing antibody specific models have a notable limitation that they lack explicit consideration for antibody structural information, despite the fact that both 1D sequence and 3D structure carry unique and complementary insights into antibody behavior and functionality. This paper proposes Sequence-Structure multi-level pre-trained Antibody Language Model (S$^2$ALM), combining holistic sequential and structural information in one unified, generic antibody foundation model. We construct a hierarchical pre-training paradigm incorporated with two customized multi-level training objectives to facilitate the modeling of comprehensive antibody representations. S$^2$ALM's representation space uncovers inherent functional binding mechanisms, biological evolution properties and structural interaction patterns. Pre-trained over 75 million sequences and 11.7 million structures, S$^2$ALM can be adopted for diverse downstream tasks: accurately predicting antigen-antibody binding affinities, precisely distinguishing B cell maturation stages, identifying antibody crucial binding positions, and specifically designing novel coronavirus-binding antibodies. Remarkably, S$^2$ALM outperforms well-established and renowned baselines and sets new state-of-the-art performance across extensive antibody specific understanding and generation tasks. S$^2$ALM's ability to model comprehensive and generalized representations further positions its potential to advance real-world therapeutic antibody development, potentially addressing unmet academic, industrial, and clinical needs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Discrete Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models that produce novel molecular structures have the potential to facilitate chemical discovery. Flow matching is a recently proposed generative modeling framework that has achieved impressive performance on a variety of tasks including those on biomolecular structures. The seminal flow matching framework was developed only for continuous data. However, de novo molecular design tasks require generating discrete data such as atomic elements or sequences of amino acid residues. Several discrete flow matching methods have been proposed recently to address this gap. In this work we benchmark the performance of existing discrete flow matching methods for 3D de novo small molecule generation and provide explanations of their differing behavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC, an open-source model that achieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo design with fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we propose the use of metrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical valency constraints and towards higher-order structural motifs. These metrics show that even though basic constraints are satisfied, the models tend to produce unusual and potentially problematic functional groups outside of the training data distribution.

      <title>IDP-Bert: Predicting Properties of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) constitute a large and structure-less class of proteins with significant functions. The existence of IDPs challenges the conventional notion that the biological functions of proteins rely on their three-dimensional structures. Despite lacking well-defined spatial arrangements, they exhibit diverse biological functions, influencing cellular processes and shedding light on the disease mechanisms. However, it is expensive to run experiments or simulations to characterize this class of proteins. Consequently, we designed an ML model that relies solely on amino acid sequences. In this study, we introduce IDP-Bert model, a deep-learning architecture leveraging Transformers and Protein Language Models (PLMs) to map sequences directly to IDPs properties. Our experiments demonstrate accurate predictions of IDPs properties, including Radius of Gyration, end-to-end Decorrelation Time, and Heat Capacity.</description>

      <title>Practical and Asymptotically Exact Conditional Sampling in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful on a range of conditional generation tasks including molecular design and text-to-image generation. However, these achievements have primarily depended on task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS. TDS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models through simulating a set of weighted particles. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique that enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We first find in simulation and in conditional image generation tasks that TDS provides a computational statistical trade-off, yielding more accurate approximations with many particles but with empirical improvements over heuristics with as few as two particles. We then turn to motif-scaffolding, a core task in protein design, using a TDS extension to Riemannian diffusion models. On benchmark test cases, TDS allows flexible conditioning criteria and often outperforms the state of the art.</description>
