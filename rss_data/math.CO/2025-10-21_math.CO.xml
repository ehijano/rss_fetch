      <title>An improved upper bound for the multicolour Ramsey number of odd cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $k$-colour Ramsey number of an odd cycle of length $2 \ell + 1$ is at most $(4 \ell)^k \cdot k^{k/\ell}$. This proves a conjecture of Fox and is the first improvement in the exponent that goes beyond an absolute constant factor since the work of Bondy and Erd\H{o}s from 1973.</description>

      <title>On the expansion of Hanoi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Tower of Hanoi puzzle involves moving $n$ discs of distinct sizes from one of $p\geq 3$ pegs (traditionally $p=3$) to another of the pegs, subject to the constraints that only one disc may be moved at a time, and no disc can ever be placed on a disc smaller than itself. Much is known about the Hanoi graph $H_p^n$, whose $p^n$ vertices represent the configurations of the puzzle, and whose edges represent the pairs of configurations separated by a single legal move. In a previous paper, the present authors presented nearly tight asymptotic bounds of $O((p-2)^n)$ and $\Omega(n^{(1-p)/2}(p-2)^n)$ on the treewidth of this graph for fixed $p \geq 3$. In this paper we show that the upper bound is tight, by giving a matching lower bound of $\Omega((p-2)^n)$ for the expansion of $H_p^n$.</description>

      <title>On the Diameter of Arrangements of Topological Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}=\{D_0,\ldots,D_{n-1}\}$ be a set of $n$ topological disks in the plane and let $\mathcal{A} := \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{D})$ be the arrangement induced by~$\mathcal{D}$. For two disks $D_i,D_j\in\mathcal{D}$, let $\Delta_{ij}$ be the number of connected components of~$D_i\cap D_j$, and let $\Delta := \max_{i,j} \Delta_{ij}$.
  We show that the diameter of $\mathcal{G}^*$, the dual graph of~$\mathcal{A}$, can be bounded as a function of $n$ and $\Delta$. Thus, any two points in the plane can be connected by a Jordan curve that crosses the disk boundaries a number of times bounded by a function of~$n$ and~$\Delta$. In particular, for the case of two disks we prove that the diameter of $\mathcal{G}^*$ is at most $\max\{2,2\Delta\}$ and this bound is tight. % For the general case of $n&gt;2$ disks, we show that the diameter of $\mathcal{G}^*$ is at most $2 n(\Delta+1)^{n(n-1)/2} \min\{n,\Delta+1\}$. We achieve this by proving that the number of maximal faces in $\mathcal{A}$ -- the faces whose ply is more than the ply of their neighboring faces -- is at most $n(\Delta+1)^{n(n-1)/2}$, which is interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>Classification of Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems related to bipartite cluster algebras. It was first observed by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, initially for simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. It was proved by Keller to hold for tensor products of two Dynkin diagrams, and further shown by Galashin and Pylyavskyy to hold for pairs of commuting simply-laced Cartan matrices of finite type, which Stembridge classified in his study of admissible $W$-cells. We prove that the Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras are in bijection with pairs of commuting (not necessarily reduced or simply-laced) Cartan matrices of finite type. We fully classify all such pairs into 29 infinite families and 14 exceptional types in addition to the 6 infinite families and 11 exceptional types in Stembridge's classification, and show that all of these families can be derived from simply-laced types through folding and transpose. Finally, we find that these pairs are in 1-to-4 correspondence with nonnegative $W$-cells for products of two dihedral groups $W = I_2(p)\times I_2(q)$, which encode the action of the standard generators on the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of the associated Iwahori--Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W)$.</description>

      <title>Sunlet factors for Cartesian products of cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sunlet is a cycle with a pendant edge attached at each vertex of the cycle. For the bipartite toroidal grid graphs $C_{2n} \Box C_{2n}$, factorizations into sunlets are given by homomorphisms from disjoint unions of $s$ copies of a sunlet for $s \in \{1, n, n^2\}, n \geq 3$ such that edges are mapped bijectively.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Intersecting Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ is $H$-intersecting if the edge intersection of any two graphs in $\mathcal{F}$ contains a copy of a fixed graph $H$. A fundamental problem is to determine the maximum size of such a family. The trivial lower bound of $2^{\binom{n}{2} - e(H)}$ is known to be not sharp for some graphs, such as the $P_4$ graph, as shown by Christofides. This paper presents two main contributions. First, we introduce a general construction for $H$-intersecting families based on decompositions of complete multipartite graphs. This construction yields new, improved lower bounds on the maximum size of $H$-intersecting families where $H$ is a complete multipartite graph of the form $K_{s_1, \dots, s_{k-1}, t}$, improving upon the trivial bound when $t \geq 2^{\sum s_i}$. Second, we conjecture the $\frac{17}{128}$ Christofides bound for $P_4$ is optimal, which would resolve the Alon-Spencer conjecture. We computationally verify this density is optimal for families generated by connected 6-vertex host graphs with 7 or 8 edges.</description>

      <title>Universality for transversal powers of Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k \ge 2$ and let $\bf G = \{G_1, \ldots, G_{m}\}$ be a collection of graphs on a common vertex set of cardinality $n$. We show that if each graph in $\bf G$ has minimum degree at least $(1-\frac{1}{2k} + o(1))n$, then for every edge-colouring $\chi$ of the $k$th power of a Hamilton cycle $C_n^k$ with $m$ colours, there is a copy of $C_n^k$ in $\bf G$ such that $e \in G_{\chi(e)}$ for every edge $e$ in $C_n^k$. This generalises a result of Bowtell, Morris, Pehova, and Staden, who provided asymptotically best possible minimum degree conditions for the Hamilton cycle.</description>

      <title>Constrained Ramsey numbers for rainbow $P_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$ and a positive integer $k$, the {\it $k$-colored Ramsey number} $R_k(H)$ is the minimum integer $n$ such that in every $k$-edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_{n}$, there is a monochromatic copy of $H$. Given two graphs $H$ and $G$, the {\it constrained Ramsey number} (also called {\it rainbow Ramsey number}) $f(H,G)$ is defined as the minimum integer $n$ such that, in every edge-coloring of $K_{n}$ with any number of colors, there is either a monochromatic copy of $H$ or a rainbow copy of $G$. Let $P_t$ be the path on $t$ vertices. Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, Lehel and Schelp proved that $f(H,P_5)=R_3(H)$ when $H$ is a path or a cycle. Li, Besse, Magnant, Wang and Watts conjectured that $f(H,P_5)=R_3(H)$ for any graph $H$, and confirmed this for all connected graphs and all bipartite graphs. In this paper, we address this conjecture for multiple classes of disconnected graphs with chromatic number at least 3. Our newly established general results encompass all known results on this problem. We also obtain several results for a bipartite variation of the problem. In addition, we propose a series of questions concerning this problem from multiple distinct aspects for further research.</description>

      <title>Edge-colored 3-uniform hypergraphs without rainbow paths of length 3 and its applications to Ramsey theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Ramsey theory problems, we consider edge-colorings of 3-uniform hypergraphs that contain no rainbow paths of length 3. There are three 3-uniform paths of length 3: the tight path $\mathcal{T}=\{v_1v_2v_3, v_2v_3v_4, v_3v_4v_5\}$, the messy path $\mathcal{M}=\{v_1v_2v_3, v_2v_3v_4, v_4v_5v_6\}$ and the loose path $\mathcal{L}=\{v_1v_2v_3,$ $v_3v_4v_5, v_5v_6v_7\}$. In this paper, we characterize the structures of edge-colored complete 3-uniform hypergraph $K_n^{(3)}$ without rainbow $\mathcal{T}$, $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{L}$, respectively. This generalizes a result of Thomason-Wagner on edge-colored complete graph $K_n$ without rainbow paths of length 3. We also obtain a multipartite generalization of these results.
  As applications, we obtain several Ramsey-type results. Given two $3$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ and $G$, the {\it constrained Ramsey number} $f(H,G)$ is defined as the minimum integer $n$ such that, in every edge-coloring of $K^{(3)}_n$ with any number of colors, there is either a monochromatic copy of $H$ or a rainbow copy of $G$. For $G\in \{\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{L}\}$ and infinitely many 3-uniform hypergraphs $H$, we reduce $f(H, G)$ to the 2-colored Ramsey number of $H$, that is, $f(H, G)=R_2(H)$. Given a $3$-uniform hypergraph $G$ and an integer $n\geq |V(G)|$, the {\it anti-Ramsey number} $ar(n, G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that, in every edge-coloring of $K^{(3)}_n$ with at least $k$ colors, there is a rainbow copy of $G$. We show that $ar(n, \mathcal{T})=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{3}\right\rfloor+2$ for $n\geq 5$, $ar(n, \mathcal{M})=3$ for $n\geq 7$, and $ar(n, \mathcal{L})=n$ for $n\geq 7$. Our newly obtained Ramsey-type results extend results of Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s-Lehel-Schelp and Liu on constrained Ramsey numbers, and improve a result of Tang-Li-Yan on anti-Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>On the b-chromatic number of star graph operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $b$-coloring is a proper coloring such that for each color class, there exists at least one vertex that is adjacent to at least one vertex in every other color class. The $b$-chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the maximum number $k$ such that $G$ admits a $b$-coloring with $k$ colors. This paper focuses on the $b$-chromatic number of the power graph of the Cartesian product of star graphs. In addition, we also study the total graph and the line graph of the Cartesian product of star graphs. Our main result generalizes the result shown in \cite{qn} on the b-chromatic number of the Cartesian product of two stars. We find exact values for the b-chromatic number of particular Cartesian products of complete graphs and explore the bounds of the generalized Cartesian product of complete graphs.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian expansion of congruence KMS complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coboundary expansion with non-Abelian coefficients is a strong version of high-dimensional expansion for simplicial complexes. One motivation for studying this notion is that it was recently shown to have deep connections to problems in theoretical computer science. However, very few examples of families of simplicial complexes with this type of expansion are known. Namely, prior to our work, the only known examples were quotients of symplectic buildings and a slight variation of the Kaufman-Oppenheim coset complexes construction associated with $\operatorname{SL}_{n} (\mathbb{F}_p [t])$.
  In this paper, we show that the Grave de Peralta and Valentiner-Branth constructions of KMS complexes have coboundary expansion with non-Abelian coefficients when it is performed with respect to congruence subgroups of Chevalley groups of classical type, i.e., of type $A_n, B_n, C_n$ and $D_n$. This gives four new sources of examples to this expansion phenomenon, thus significantly enriching our list of constructions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subdivided double construction on 4-regular graphs was used by Poto\v{c}nik and Wilson to explore semi-symmetric (edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive) graphs, and can be used to construct every semi-symmetric 4-regular graph that contains a pair of twin vertices. We show that (regardless of symmetry) subdivided doubles have another curious property: they have exponentially many Hamiltonian cycles each of which is complementary to another Hamiltonian cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note studies the asymptotic behavior of a generating function associated with the decimal expansion of \(2^n\). Our aims are twofold: (i) to present a problem on the best possible upper bound for this behavior, and (ii) to introduce a matrix representation that is useful for its analysis. The representation corresponds to a finite-state transfer operator; analytic and dynamical aspects are not pursued here.</description>

      <title>Operads and bialgebras of multi-indices, and Novikov algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncommutative multi-indices are noncommutative monomials in a $\mathbb{N}$-indexed family of indeterminates. We define on them a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded operadic structure, with the help of a shifting derivation. Multi-indices of degree 0 are called populated: they form a suboperad, isomorphic to the operad of Novikov algebras. This operadic structure, and the relation between pre-Lie and Novikov algebras, induces two bialgebraic structure in cointeraction on commutative multi-indices. We show how to combinatorially embed this double bialgebra into the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted trees, with its two coproducts based, firstly on cuts, secondly, on contraction of edges, and how this embedding can be characterized by a Dyson-Schwinger equation. We also study the unique polynomial invariant compatible with the two bialgebraic structures on multi-indices and use to describe the antipode for the first coproduct.</description>

      <title>Fair and Tolerant (FAT) Graph Colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study Fair and Tolerant colorings (FAT colorings), where each vertex tolerates a given fraction of same-colored neighbors while fairness is preserved across the other coloring classes. Moreover, we define the FAT chromatic number $\chi^{\mathrm{FAT}}(G)$ as the largest integer $k$ for which $G$ admits a FAT $k$-coloring. We establish general bounds on $\chi^{\mathrm{FAT}}$, relate it to structural and spectral properties of graphs, and characterize it completely for several families of graphs. We conclude with a list of open questions that suggest future directions.</description>

      <title>Circular sorting, strong complete mappings and wreath product constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of Adin, Alon and Roichman (arXiv:2502.14398) on the number of steps required to sort $n$ labelled points on a circle by transpositions. Imagine that the vertices of a cycle of length $n$ are labelled by the elements $1,\dots,n$. We are allowed to change this labelling by swapping the labels of any two vertices on the cycle. How many swaps are needed to obtain a labelling that has the elements $1,\dots,n$ in clockwise order?
  We provide evidence for their conjecture that at most $n-3$ transpositions are needed to sort a circular permutation when $n$ is not prime. We prove this conjecture when $2\mid n$ or $3\mid n$ and when restricting to permutations given by a polynomial over $\mathbb{Z}_n$. We also provide various algebraic constructions of circular permutations that take many transpositions to sort, most notably providing one that matches our upper bound when $n=3p$ for $p$ an odd prime, and disproving their second conjecture by providing non-affine circular permutations that require $n-2$ transpositions (for $n$ prime). We also improve the lower bounds for some sequences of composite numbers. Finally, we improve the bounds for small $n$ computationally. In particular, we prove a tight upper bound for $n=25$ via an exhaustive computer search using a new connection between this problem and strong complete mappings.</description>

      <title>Planarity and dimension I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimension of a partially ordered set $P$ (poset for short) is the least positive integer $d$ such that $P$ is isomorphic to a subposet of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the natural product order. Dimension is arguably the most widely studied measure of complexity for posets, and standard examples in posets are the canonical structure forcing dimension to be large. In many ways, dimension for posets is analogous to chromatic number for graphs with standard examples in posets playing the role of cliques in graphs. However, planar graphs have chromatic number at most four, while posets with planar diagrams may have arbitrarily large dimension. The key feature of all known constructions of such posets is that large dimension is forced by a large standard example. The question of whether every poset of large dimension and with a planar cover graph contains a large standard example has been a critical challenge in posets theory since the early 1980s, with very little progress over the years. We answer the question in the affirmative. Namely, we show that every poset $P$ with a planar cover graph has dimension $\mathcal{O}(s^8)$, where $s$ is the maximum order of a standard example in $P$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peca suggested in a recent paper on the arxiv to consider binary butterfly trees and their Horton-Strahler numbers.
  The trees are obtained by glueing two binary trees together in a special way; the results are again binary trees but with
  a different probability distribution. A thorough combinatorial analysis is provided and leads asymptotically to the same results as for classical binary trees.</description>

      <title>Ordinal and disjoint sums of partially ordered patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially ordered patterns (POPs) generalize the classical notion of permutation patterns within the framework of pattern avoidance. Building on recent work by Burstein, Han, Kitaev, and Zhang, which introduced the concept of shape-Wilf-equivalence of sets of patterns, we develop the notions of \emph{ordinal} and \emph{disjoint sums} of labeled posets. This framework enables us to reinterpret their main result as an ordinal sum analogue of the classical theorem by Backelin, West, and Xin. We establish analogous results for disjoint sums of POPs and further extend their results to prove Wilf-equivalence for classes of POPs that include isolated vertices. In particular, we prove the shape-Wilf-equivalence of the sets of patterns $\{123, 213, 312\}$ and $\{132, 231, 321\}$. Our proof strategy involves a bijection that filters through an encoding scheme for the transversals avoiding these patterns. We use these results to completely classify the partially ordered patterns of size $3,4,5$ whose connected components are all chains. This classification also confirms a conjecture posed by Dimitrov at the problem session of the British Combinatorics Conference 2024 (BCC30).</description>

      <title>On colourings of cubic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the integral lattice $\Lambda^d$ in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, partitions of the lattice nodes into orbits of finite-index subgroups of $Aut(\Lambda^d)$ have been computed for $d \leq 4$. These partitions can be interpreted as colourings of orbits defined up to permutation of colours. Complete results are obtained for $d=2$ up to 64 orbits, for $d=3$ up to 8 orbits, and for 2 orbits in dimension 4. The automorphism groups of the partitions are also determined. Our results for two orbits in dimension 3 correct the old result of H. Heesch [Z. Kristallogr., (1933), 85, 335--344] who overlooked one partition.</description>

      <title>Long paths need not minimize $H$-colorings among trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a target graph $H$, an $H$-coloring of $G$ is an adjacency-preserving vertex map from $G$ to $H$. By appropriate choice of $H$, these colorings can express, for instance, the independent sets or proper vertex colorings of $G$.
  Sidorenko proved that for any $H$, the $n$-vertex star admits at least as many $H$-colorings as any other $n$-vertex tree, but the minimization question remains open in general. For many graphs $H$, path graphs are among the trees with the fewest $H$-colorings, but work of Leontovich and subsequently Csikv\'ari and Lin shows that there is a graph $E_7$ on seven vertices and a target graph $H$ for which there are strictly fewer $H$-colorings of $E_7$ than of the path on seven vertices.
  We introduce a new strategy for enumerating homomorphisms from path-like trees to highly symmetric target graphs that allows us to make the previous observations completely explicit and extend them to infinitely many $n$ beyond $n=7$. In particular, we exhibit a target graph $H$ with the property that for each sufficiently large $n$, there is a tree $E_n$ on $n$ vertices that admits strictly fewer $H$-colorings than the path on $n$ vertices.</description>

      <title>An AI enhanced approach to the tree unimodality conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, its independence sequence is the integral sequence $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of independent sets of vertices of size i. In the late 80's Alavi, Erdos, Malde, Schwenk showed that this sequence need not be unimodal for general graphs, but conjectured that it is always unimodal whenever $G$ is a tree. This conjecture was then naturally generalized to claim that the independence sequence of trees should be log concave, in the sense that $a_i^2$ is always above $a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$. This conjecture stood for many years, until in 2023, Kadrawi, Levit, Yosef, and Mirzrachi proved that there were exactly two trees on 26 vertices whose independence sequence was not log concave. In this paper, we use the AI architecture PatternBoost, developed by Charton, Ellenberg, Wagner, and Williamson to train a machine to find counter-examples to the log-concavity conjecture. We will discuss the successes of this approach - finding tens of thousands of new counter-examples to log-concavity with vertex set sizes varying from 27 to 101 - and some of its fascinating failures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding on the graph theoretic ideas of k-component order connectivity and distance-l domination, we present a quadratic-complexity algorithm that finds a tree's minimum failure-set cardinality, i.e., the minimum cardinality any subset of the tree's vertices must have so that all clusters of vertices further away than some l do not exceed a cardinality threshold. Applications of solutions to the expanded problems include choosing service center locations so that no large neighborhoods are excluded from service, while reducing the redundancy inherent in distance domination problems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced power graphs of finite groups with cograph structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhanced power graph, $\mathcal{E}(G)$, of a group $G$ has vertex set $G$ and two elements are adjacent if they generate a cyclic subgroup. In the case of finite groups, we identify some striking and unexpected properties of these graphs, as well as links between properties of $\mathcal{E}(G)$ and properties of the group $G$. We prove that if $\mathcal{E}(G)$ is a cograph then it is also a chordal graph. Making use of properties of simplicial vertices, we characterise the finite groups $G$ whose enhanced power graph is diamond-free or a block graph. We also characterise the finite groups having enhanced power graph a cograph or a quasi-threshold graph, and those with $C_4$-free enhanced power graph. We use these characterisations to classify the finite nonabelian simple groups whose enhanced power graph is a cograph and give information on the finite simple groups whose enhanced power graph is $C_4$-free. Some open problems are posed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of whether rectangular polyominoes with holes are cube-foldable, that is, whether they can be folded into a cube, if creases are only allowed along grid lines. It is known that holes of sufficient size guarantee that this is the case.
  Smaller holes which by themselves do not make a rectangular polyomino cube-foldable can sometimes be combined to create cube-foldable polyominoes. We investigate minimal sets of holes which guarantee cube-foldability. We show that if all holes are of the same type, the these minimal sets have size at most 4, and if we allow different types of holes, then there is no upper bound on the size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a graph (undirected, directed, or mixed), a cycle-factor is a collection of vertex-disjoint cycles covering the entire vertex set. Cycle-factors subject to parity constraints arise naturally in the study of structural graph theory and algorithmic complexity. In this work, we study four variants of the problem of finding a cycle-factor subject to parity constraints: (1) all cycles are odd, (2) all cycles are even, (3) at least one cycle is odd, and (4) at least one cycle is even. These variants are considered in the undirected, directed, and mixed settings. We show that all but the fourth problem are NP-complete in all settings, while the complexity of the fourth one remains open for the directed and undirected cases. We also show that in mixed graphs, even deciding the existence of any cycle factor is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>On density analogs of Hindman's finite sums theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density, we show the existence of an infinite set $B$ and sequences $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}, (s_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B + s_k, 1 \leq |F| \leq k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. This strengthens the density finite sums theorem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson. We further show, given such a set $A$, the existence of an infinite set $B$ and a sequence $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B, |F| = k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. As a corollary, we obtain a sequence $(B_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite sets of natural numbers such that $B_1+\cdots +B_k \subset A$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We also establish the optimality of our main theorems by providing counterexamples to potential further generalizations, and thereby addressing questions of the aforementioned authors in the context of density analogs to Hindman's finite sums theorem.</description>

Abstract: Given a finite abelian group $G$ and a subset $J\subset G$ with $0\in J$, let $D_{G}(J,N)$ be the maximum size of $A\subset G^{N}$ such that the difference set $A-A$ and $J^{N}$ have no non-trivial intersection. Recently, this extremal problem has been widely studied for different groups $G$ and subsets $J$. In this paper, we generalize and improve the relevant results by Alon and by Heged\H{u}s by building a bridge between this problem and cyclotomic polynomials with the help of algebraic graph theory. In particular, we construct infinitely many non-trivial families of $G$ and $J$ for which the current known upper bounds on $D_{G}(J, N)$ can be improved exponentially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact finite-rank nilspaces have become central in the nilspace approach to higher-order Fourier analysis, notably through their role in a general form of the inverse theorem for the Gowers norms. This paper studies these nilspaces per se, and in connection with further refinements of this inverse theorem that have been conjectured recently. Our first main result states that every compact finite-rank nilspace is obtained by taking a free nilspace (a nilspace based on an abelian group of the form $\mathbb{Z}^{r}\times \mathbb{R}^s$) and quotienting this by a discrete group action of a specific type, describable in terms of polynomials. We call these group actions "higher-order lattice actions", as they generalize actions of lattices in $\mathbb{Z}^r\times \mathbb{R}^s$. The second main result (which relies on the first one) represents every compact finite-rank nilspace as a double-coset space $K\backslash G / \Gamma$ where $G$ is a nilpotent Lie group of a specific kind. Our third main result extends the aforementioned results to $k$-step compact nilspaces (not necessarily of finite rank), by representing any such nilspace as a quotient of infinite products of free nilspaces and also as double coset spaces $K\backslash G/\Gamma$ where $G$ is a degree-$k$ nilpotent pro-Lie group. These results open the study of compact nilspaces to areas more classical than nilspace theory, such as the theory of topological group actions. The results also require developing the theory of topological non-compact nilspaces, for which we provide groundwork in this paper. Applications include new inverse theorems for Gowers norms on any finite abelian group. These theorems are purely group theoretic in that the correlating harmonics are based on double-coset spaces. This yields progress towards the Jamneshan-Tao conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute a triangulation of certain faces of the submodular cone. More precisely, graphical zonotopes are generalized permutahedra, and hence their deformation cones are faces of the submodular cone. We give a triangulation of these faces for graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 4 vertices. We deduce the rays of these faces: Minkowski indecomposable deformations of these graphical zonotopes are segments and triangles.
  Besides, computer experiments lead to examples of graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 5 vertices, whose graphical zonotopes have high dimensional Minkowski indecomposable deformations.</description>

      <title>On sets with missing differences in compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density for $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density for $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$. It follows that, for up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian group is always a rational number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conflict-free chromatic number of hypergraphs derived from the family of facets of $d$-dimensional cyclic polytopes with $n$ vertices. While in odd dimensions $d$ the problem is easy, for even dimensions the problem becomes very difficult and exhibits interesting connections to extremal graph theory. We provide sharp asymptotic bounds for the conflict-free chromatic number in several small even dimensions and non-trivial upper and lower bounds for general even dimensions. The main purpose of this paper is revealing a surprising relation between conflict-free colorings and the celebrated Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture, opening new avenues for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph property is elusive (or evasive) if any algorithm testing it by asking questions of the form ''Is there an edge between vertices x and y?'' must, in the worst case, examine all pairs of vertices. Elusiveness for infinite vertex sets has been first studied by Csern\'ak and Soukup, who proved that the long-standing Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg Conjecture -- which states that every nontrivial monotone graph property is elusive -- fails for infinite vertex sets. We extend their work by giving a closer look to the case when the vertex set is countably infinite and the ''algorithm'' terminates after infinitely many steps. Among others, we prove that connectedness is elusive, which strengthens a result of Csern\'ak and Soukup. We give counterexamples to the infinite version of the Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg Conjecture even if the ''algorithm'' is required to terminate after infinitely many steps, which strengthens results of Csern\'ak and Soukup.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for the biased Maker-Breaker domination games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $(a,b)$-biased Maker-Breaker domination game, two players alternately select unplayed vertices in a graph $G$ such that Dominator selects $a$ and Staller selects $b$ vertices per move. Dominator wins if the vertices he selected during the game form a dominating set of $G$, while Staller wins if she can prevent Dominator from achieving this goal. Given a positive integer $b$, Dominator's threshold, $\textrm{a}_b$, is the minimum $a$ such that Dominator wins the $(a,b)$-biased game on $G$ when he starts the game. Similarly, $\textrm{a}'_b$ denotes the minimum $a$ such that Dominator wins when Staller starts the $(a,b)$-biased game. Staller's thresholds, $\textrm{b}_a$ and $\textrm{b}'_a$, are defined analogously. It is proved that Staller wins the $(k-1,k)$-biased games in a graph $G$ if its order is sufficiently large with respect to a function of $k$ and the maximum degree of $G$. Along the way, the $\ell$-local domination number of a graph is introduced. This new parameter is proved to bound Dominator's thresholds $\textrm{a}_\ell$ and $\textrm{a}_\ell'$ from above. As a consequence, $\textrm{a}_1'(G)\le 2$ holds for every claw-free graph $G$. More specific results are obtained for thresholds in line graphs and Cartesian grids. Based on the concept of $[1,k]$-factor of a graph $G$, we introduce the star partition width $\sigma(G)$ of $G$, and prove that $\textrm{a}_1'(G)\le \sigma(G)$ holds for any nontrivial graph $G$, while $\textrm{a}_1'(G)=\sigma(G)$ if $G$ is a tree.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial generation via permutation languages. VII. Supersolvable hyperplane arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arrangement $\mathcal{H}$ of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ through the origin, a region is a connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\mathcal{H}$. The graph of regions $G(\mathcal{H})$ has a vertex for every region, and an edge between any two vertices whose corresponding regions are separated by a single hyperplane from $\mathcal{H}$. We aim to compute a Hamiltonian path or cycle in the graph $G(\mathcal{H})$, i.e., a path or cycle that visits every vertex (=region) exactly once. Our first main result is that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a supersolvable arrangement, then the graph of regions $G(\mathcal{H})$ has a Hamiltonian cycle. More generally, we consider quotients of lattice congruences of the poset of regions $P(\mathcal{H},R_0)$, obtained by orienting the graph $G(\mathcal{H})$ away from a particular base region $R_0$. Our second main result is that if $\mathcal{H}$ is supersolvable and $R_0$ is a canonical base region, then for any lattice congruence $\equiv$ on $P(\mathcal{H},R_0)=:L$, the cover graph of the quotient lattice $L/\equiv$ has a Hamiltonian path.

      <description>arXiv:2206.04570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work solves a 28-year conjecture by showing that two major invariants of smooth 4-manifolds, the shadow model (motivated by statistical mechanics [Tur91]) and the simplicial Crane-Yetter model (motivated by topological quantum field theory [CY93]), are in fact equal.
  These invariants, both of which degenerate to the 3D Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev model in a special case, had been open for years to clarify their relationship. Despite the seeming difference in their origins and formal constructions, we prove their equivalence. Along the way, we sketch a dictionary between the two models, provide a brief survey of the shadow construction \`a la Turaev, and suggest once again that the semisimple models have reached their limits.</description>

      <title>CayleyPy RL: Pathfinding and Reinforcement Learning on Cayley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of studies on developing efficient artificial intelligence-based approaches to pathfinding on extremely large graphs (e.g. $10^{70}$ nodes) with a focus on Cayley graphs and mathematical applications. The open-source CayleyPy project is a central component of our research. The present paper proposes a novel combination of a reinforcement learning approach with a more direct diffusion distance approach from the first paper. Our analysis includes benchmarking various choices for the key building blocks of the approach: architectures of the neural network, generators for the random walks and beam search pathfinding. We compared these methods against the classical computer algebra system GAP, demonstrating that they "overcome the GAP" for the considered examples. As a particular mathematical application we examine the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with cyclic shift and transposition generators. We provide strong support for the OEIS-A186783 conjecture that the diameter is equal to n(n-1)/2 by machine learning and mathematical methods. We identify the conjectured longest element and generate its decomposition of the desired length. We prove a diameter lower bound of n(n-1)/2-n/2 and an upper bound of n(n-1)/2+ 3n by presenting the algorithm with given complexity. We also present several conjectures motivated by numerical experiments, including observations on the central limit phenomenon (with growth approximated by a Gumbel distribution), the uniform distribution for the spectrum of the graph, and a numerical study of sorting networks. To stimulate crowdsourcing activity, we create challenges on the Kaggle platform and invite contributions to improve and benchmark approaches on Cayley graph pathfinding and other tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study adjoint hypersurfaces of geometric objects obtained by intersecting simple polytopes with few facets in $\mathbb{P}^5$ with the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$. These generalize the positive Grassmannian, which is the intersection of $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$ with the simplex. We show that if the resulting object has five facets, it is a positive geometry and the adjoint hypersurface is unique. For the case of six facets we show that the adjoint hypersurface is not necessarily unique and give an upper bound on the dimension of the family of adjoints. We illustrate our results with a range of examples. In particular, we show that even if the adjoint is not unique, a positive hexahedron can still be a positive geometry.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of characters of parabolic Verma modules, and of restricted Kostant partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Huh-Matherne-M\'esz\'aros-St. Dizier showed that normalized Schur polynomials are Lorentzian, thereby yielding their continuous (resp. discrete) log-concavity on the positive orthant (resp. on their support, in type $A$ root directions). A reinterpretation of this result is that the characters of finite-dimensional simple representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian (DL). In the same paper, these authors also showed that shifted characters of Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are DL.
  In this work we extend these results to a larger family of modules that subsumes both of the above: we show that shifted characters of all parabolic Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian. The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we explain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition function of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and normalizing.
  We then show that parabolic Vermas form a "maximal" class with log-concave (hence DL) characters. Namely, log-concavity fails in greater generality along three natural directions: (1) it does not hold for every simple Lie type, (2) nor for a larger universal family of highest weight modules, the higher order Verma modules, even in type $A$, and (3) it does not always hold for important generalizations of Schur polynomials: the Jack and Macdonald polynomials.
  Finally, we extend these results to parabolic (i.e. "first order") and higher order Verma modules over the semisimple Lie algebras $\oplus_{t=1}^T \mathfrak{sl}_{n_t+1}(\mathbb{C})$. We also partially resolve a conjecture of Huh et al on the DL property for integral highest weight simple modules.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of cluster maps of type $D_{2N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend one of the main results from our joint work with Hone and Mase, in which we studied a deformed type $D_{4}$ map, to the general case of the type $D_{2N}$ for $N\geq3$. This can be achieved through a ``local expansion" operation, introduced in our joint work with Grabowski and Hone. This operation involves inserting a specific subquiver into the quiver arising from the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{4}$ map. This insertion yields a new quiver, obtained through the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{6}$ map and thus enables systematic generalization to higher ranks $D_{2N}$. We also study the degree growth of deformed type $D_{2N}$ map via the tropical method and conjecture that, for each $N$, the deformed map is an integrable, as indicated by the algebraic entropy test, the criterion for detecting integrability in the discrete dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices II: Formulas and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups.
  In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients.
  As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</description>

Abstract: We establish explicit operator norm bounds and essential self-adjointness criteria for discrete Hodge Laplacians on weighted graphs and simplicial complexes. For unweighted $d$-regular graphs we prove the universal estimate $\|\widetilde{\Delta}_{1,*}\|\le 4(d-1)$, and we provide weighted extensions with a sharp comparability constant. These bounds apply without geometric completeness or curvature assumptions and ensure essential self-adjointness on natural cores. The approach extends to higher degrees via dual up/down degrees, and we show a unitary equivalence between skew and symmetric models on colorable complexes. For periodic lattices we complement the universal bounds with exact Floquet--Bloch constants, typically of order $2d$, illustrating both the sharpness in growth and the generality of our method.</description>
