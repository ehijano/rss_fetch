      <title>A Novel Proposal for Exploring Spacetime Microstructure with Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of physics at the Planck scale has garnered significant attention due to its implications for understanding the fundamental nature of the universe. At this scale, quantum fluctuations in spacetime become apparent, as suggested by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. These fluctuations indicate that spacetime is not a smooth manifold but rather has a more complex structure that might be fractal-like, exhibiting self-similarity across different scales. This study investigates the scaling behavior of spacetime microstructure at the Planck scale. By introducing the concept of self-similar spacetime microelement measurements, a scaling-characterized metric tensor is derived from analyzing the Lorentz scalar line element, which imposes constraints on spacetime dimensions and components. In linear scale measurements of spacetime, equivalent equations - such as the geodesic equations, Einstein field equations, Klein-Gordon equation, and Dirac equation - can be expressed in scaling form. Notably, the golden ratio naturally appears in the microstructure of linear scale measurements, suggesting a potential explanation for the Planck length's significance. This work provides insights into quantum fluctuations and proposes modifications to classical geometric intuitions, potentially advancing our understanding of the microstructure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Incorporating model accuracy into gravitational-wave Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring the properties of colliding black holes from gravitational-wave observations is subject to systematic errors arising from modelling uncertainties. Although the accuracy of each model can be calculated through comparison to theoretical expectations from general relativity, Bayesian analyses are yet to incorporate this information. As such, a mixture model is typically used where results obtained with different gravitational-wave models are combined with either equal weight, or based on their relative Bayesian evidence. In this work we present a novel method to incorporate the accuracy of multiple models in gravitational-wave Bayesian analyses. By analysing simulated gravitational-wave signals in zero-noise, we show that our technique uses $30\%$ less computational resources, and more faithfully recovers the true parameters than existing techniques. We envisage that this method will become an essential tool within ground-based gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Violating Lorentz invariance minimally by the emergence of nonmetricity? A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance belongs to the fundamental symmetries of nature. It is basic for the successful Standard Model of Particle Physics. Nevertheless, within the last decades, Lorentz invariance has been repeatedly questioned. In fact, there exist different research programs addressing this problem. We argue that a most adequate understanding of a possible violation of Lorentz invariance is achieved in the framework of the gauge-theoretic approach to gravity: a non-vanishing nonmetricity of a metric-affine geometry of spacetime heralds the violation of the Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stable massless scalar polarization of f(R) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization is a prominent feature of gravitational wave observation, and it can be used to distinguish different modified gravities. Compared to General Relativity, f(R) gravity has an additional polarization coming from scalar field, which is a mix of the longitudinal and the breathing modes. When the scalar mass of f(R) is zero, the mixed mode will reduce to a pure breathing mode with the disappearance of the longitudinal mode. However, the reducing seems not to be allowed because a positive scalar mass is often needed to maintain the stability of the cosmological perturbation. In fact, the massless case is possible to lead to a stable perturbation, but more detailed constraints need to be considered. For the completeness of the polarization analysis, we explore the possibility that there is a stable massless scalar polarization in viable f(R) models for dark energy. We find that the existence of the massless scalar polarization depends not only on the number of free parameters but also on the model structure.</description>

      <title>The Universe according to DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent fit of cosmological parameters by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration will have a significant impact on our understanding of the universe. Given its importance, we conduct several consistency checks and draw conclusions from the fit. Specifically, we focus on the following key issues relevant to cosmology: (i) the acceleration of the universe's expansion, which, according to the fit, differs over cosmological time compared to the standard cosmological model; (ii) the age of the universe, which appears slightly shorter than the age of the oldest stars; and (iii) the solution of the scale factor, both numerically and in an approximate analytical form.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Astrophysics with TianQin: A brief progress review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a space-borne gravitational wave observatory, TianQin can observe a large variety of gravitational wave sources. The rich signals can be composed by different types of astronomical systems, like Galactic compact binaries, inspiral of stellar mass black holes, merger of massive black holes, and extreme mass ratio inspirals. The incoherent summation of these signals can also form a stochastic gravitational wave background. Using the future TianQin observation, it is possible to put stringent constraints on fundamental science, like the expansion history of our universe. In this work, we provide a brief review of these topics that contributes to the 7th International Workshop on the TianQin Science Mission.</description>

      <title>Null hypersurfaces in Einstein spacetimes as Carrollian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly determine all shear-free null hypersurfaces embedded in an Einstein spacetime as oriented 3-dimensional manifolds where each is equipped with a coframe basis, a structure group and a connection. Such manifolds are known as null hypersurface structures (NHSs). The coframe and connection one-forms for an NHS arise as solutions to an exterior differential system arising from the Cartan structure equations in the spacetime projected onto the null hypersurface. We then show that each NHS corresponds to a Carrollian structure equipped with a unique pair of Ehresmann connection and affine connection.</description>

      <title>Circular and drifted Rindler Unruh effects: Two sides of the same coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Minkowski spacetime quantum field theory, each stationary motion is associated with an effective, energy-dependent notion of temperature, which generalises the familiar Unruh temperature of uniform linear acceleration. Motivated by current experimental interest in circular motion, we analyse the effective temperature for drifted Rindler motion, generated by a boost and a spacelike translation (drift), and the way in which drifted Rindler motion can be smoothly deformed to circular motion through a third type of motion known as parator. For an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled linearly to a massless scalar field in 2+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions, we establish analytic results in the limits of large gap, small gap and large drift speed. For fixed proper acceleration, the drifted Rindler temperature remains bounded in the large gap limit, in contrast to the circular motion temperature, which can be arbitrarily large in this limit. Finally, in 2+1 dimensions, we trace the vanishing of the circular motion temperature in the small gap limit to the weak decay of the Wightman function, and we show that, among all types of stationary motion in all dimensions, this phenomenon is unique to 2+1 dimensions and therein to circular and parator motion.</description>

      <title>Curvature form of Raychaudhuri equation and its consequences: A geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper aims at deriving a curvature form of the famous Raychaudhuri equation (RE) and the associated criteria for focusing of a hyper-surface orthogonal congruence of time-like geodesic. Moreover, the paper identifies a transformation of variable related to the metric scalar of the hyper-surface which converts the first order RE into a second order differential equation that resembles an equation of a Harmonic oscillator and also gives a first integral that yields the analytic solution of the RE and Lagrangian of the dynamical system representing the congruence.</description>

      <title>Finite velocity effect of ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported evidence of stochastic gravitational waves. Besides gravitational wave signals from cosmological or astrophysical origins, PTAs are also capable of detecting coherently oscillating ultralight dark matter in our galaxy. This paper investigates pulsar timing influenced by ultralight vector dark matter, based on the pure gravitational effect of the vector field. We extensively consider the finite dark matter velocity $v$ for ultralight vector dark matter in PTAs, rather than the limit $v\rightarrow0$ in previous studies. It is found that the leading-order shift in pulsar timing turns out to be proportional to negative slope of $v$. Consequently, one can not distinguish between ultralight vector dark matter and ultralight scalar dark matter with the timing residual amplitude. Assuming the existence of stochastic vector dark matter in our galaxy, the corresponding angular correlation curve in PTAs is found to be similar to that of scalar dark matter. We find that it can be distinguishable, only when the pulsar pairs are distant from the earth.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning solutions to singular problems: from special functions to spherical accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular regular points often arise in differential equations describing physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and gravitation. Traditional numerical techniques often fail or become unstable near these points, requiring the use of semi-analytical tools, such as series expansions and perturbative methods, in combination with numerical algorithms; or to invoke more sophisticated methods. In this work, we take an alternative route and leverage the power of machine learning to exploit Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a modern approach to solving differential equations with singular points. PINNs utilize deep learning architectures to approximate solutions by embedding the differential equations into the loss function of the neural network. We discuss the advantages of PINNs in handling singularities, particularly their ability to bypass traditional grid-based methods and provide smooth approximations across irregular regions. Techniques for enhancing the accuracy of PINNs near singular points, such as adaptive loss weighting, are used in order to achieve high efficiency in the training of the network. We exemplify our results by studying four differential equations of interest in mathematics and gravitation -- the Legendre equation, the hypergeometric equation, the solution for black hole space-times in theories of Lorentz violating gravity, and the spherical accretion of a perfect fluid in a Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Neutron star g-modes in the relativistic Cowling approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mature neutron stars are expected to exhibit gravity g-modes due to stratification caused by a varying matter composition in the high-density core. By employing the BSk equation of state family, and working within the relativistic Cowling approximation, we examine how subtle differences in the nuclear matter assumptions impact on the g-mode spectrum. We investigate the possibility of detecting individual g-mode resonances during a binary inspiral with current and next-generation ground-based detectors, like Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our results suggest that these resonances may be within the reach of future detectors, especially for low mass stars with $M\lesssim1.4M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing black holes with and without spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories via optical features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory admits both vacuum-general relativity (GR) and scalarized hairy black holes as valid solutions, which provides a distinctive signature of new physics in strong gravity regime. In this paper, we shall examine the optical features of Gauss-Bonnet black holes with spontaneous scalarization, which is governed by the coupling parameter $\lambda$. We find that the photon sphere, critical impact parameter and innermost stable circular orbit all decrease as the increasing of $\lambda$. Using observable data from Event Horizon Telescope, we establish the upper limit for $\lambda$. Then we construct the optical appearances of the scalarized black holes illuminated by various thin accretions. Our findings reveal that the scalarized black holes consistently exhibit smaller shadow sizes and reduced brightness compared to Schwarzschild black holes. Notably, in the case of thin spherical accretion, the shadow of the scalarized black hole is smaller, but the surrounding bright ring is more pronounced. Our results highlight the observable features of the scalarized black holes, providing a distinguishable probe from their counterpart in GR in strong gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild-like black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger of binary black holes produces a series of decaying oscillations, during which energy is radiated in gravitational waves. The characteristic signal in the ringdown phase can be described by quasinormal modes (QNMs). In this paper, we investigate the QNMs resulting from scalar field perturbations of black holes surrounded by pseudo-isothermal dark matter halos. The complex frequencies of these QNMs are numerically computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation. Additionally, the time evolution of the scalar perturbations is examined using the finite difference method, considering various multipole numbers and dark matter halo parameters. For a static, spherically symmetric black hole, the photon sphere--composed of circular null geodesics--plays a crucial role in analyzing the black hole shadow. Furthermore, the connection between the black hole shadow and QNMs is explored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Horizon replicas in black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, new exploratory channels have opened up for the physics of highly compact objects, such as gravitational waves and black hole shadows. Moreover, more precise analysis and observations are now possible in the physics of accretion around compact objects. These advancements provide in particular an unprecedented insight into the physics near the horizons of a black hole. In this work we focus on the shadow boundary of a Kerr black hole, introducing observables related to special null orbits, called horizons replicas, solutions of the shadow edge equations which are related to particular photon orbits, defined by constraints on their impact parameter, carrying information about the angular momentum of the central spinning object. These orbits are related to particular regions on the shadow boundary and might be used to determine the spin of the black hole. The results provide the conditions by which horizon replicas are imprinted in the black hole shadow profile, in dependence on the black hole dimensionless spin and observational angle, providing eventually new templates for the future observations.</description>

      <title>Stars and quark stars in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the interior spacetime of stars is built in a Lorentz symmetry breaking model called bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we calculated the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this context of modified gravity. Then we show that the bumblebee field, responsible for the symmetry breaking, increases the star mass-radius relation when it assumes its vacuum expectation value. When compared to the general relativity mass-radius relation, a Lorentz symmetry breaking context, like the bumblebee gravity, could provide more massive stars, surpassing the $2.5 M_{\odot}$ limit as the interior of the star is described by quark matter with the MIT bag model.</description>

Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

      <title>On 4D, ${\mathcal{N}=2}$ deformed vector multiplets and partial supersymmetry breaking in off-shell supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic Fayet-Ilioupulous (FI) terms are used to engineer partial breaking of ${\mathcal{N}=2}$ global supersymmetry for systems of vector multiplets. The magnetic FI term induces a deformation of the off-shell field transformations associated with an imaginary constant shift of the triplet of auxiliary fields of the vector multiplet. In this paper, we elaborate on the deformation of off-shell vector multiplets in supergravity, both in components and superspace. In a superconformal framework, the deformations are associated with (composite) linear multiplets. We engineer an off-shell model that exhibits partial local supersymmetry breaking with a zero cosmological constant. This is based on the hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet introduced in arXiv:2203.12203, coupled to the SU(1,1)/U(1) special-K\"ahler sigma model in a symplectic frame admitting a holomorphic prepotential, with one compensating and one physical vector multiplet, the latter magnetically deformed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics without Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our fundamental theories, i.e., the quantum theory and general relativity, are invariant under time reversal. Only when we treat system from the point of view of thermodynamics, i.e., averaging between many subsystem components, an arrow of time emerges. The relation between thermodynamic and the quantum theory has been fertile, deeply explored and still a source of new investigations. The relation between the quantum theory and gravity, while it has not yet brought an established theory of quantum gravity, has certainly sparkled in depth analysis and tentative new theories. On the other hand, the connection between gravity and thermodynamics is less investigated and more puzzling. I review a selection of results in covariant thermodynamics, such as the construction of a covariant notion of thermal equilibrium by considering tripartite systems. I discuss how such construction requires a relational take on thermodynamics, similarly of what happens in the quantum theory and in gravity</description>

      <title>An alternative idea about the source of baryon asymmetry in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes an alternative scenario for the emergence of baryon asymmetry in the Universe. This scenario is realized in the lattice gravity model associated with the Dirac field as follows. At ultra-high temperatures of the Grand Unification order $T_c\sim10^{18}$ GeV and higher, the system is in a PT-symmetric phase. But when the temperature decreases, a phase transition to an asymmetric phase occurs, in which a non-zero tetrad appears, that is, space-time with the Minkowski metric, and the system's wave function splits into two: $|\rangle=|+\rangle+|-\rangle$. The fields of tetrads in states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ differ in sign. At the very first moment of time with a duration of the order of the Planck time, a transition of fermions between these states is possible. These transitions in different parts of space are not correlated with each other. Therefore, the final asymmetry of the fermion charge between these states is relatively extremely small and it is preserved in time, since the interaction of the states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ ceases at times greater than the Planck time.</description>

      <title>Spacetime aspects of non-supersymmetric strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consistency of string theory as a theory of gravity does not rely on the presence of spacetime supersymmetry; however, its absence leads to the emergence of tadpole diagrams in the on-shell worldsheet formulation, thus undermining our control over the physics. Two-dimensional conformal invariance, a pillar of string theory, requires tadpole subtraction through the Fischler-Susskind mechanism, whose spacetime consequence is the emergence of scalar tadpole potentials. In this thesis, I explore several implications of the absence of supersymmetry in string-derived scenarios. I focus on the three ten-dimensional tachyon-free string theories in which spacetime supersymmetry is absent or broken, studying the gravitational consequences of tadpole potentials. First, I address vacuum solutions in terms of singular codimension-one vacua, explore their generalizations, and discuss the properties of their singular boundaries. I present an alternative perspective on these vacua based on the formalism of fake supersymmetry, in which the second-order equations of motion are replaced by supersymmetry-like first-order equations. I then turn to the topic of engineering vacua in the non-supersymmetric string models by constructing solutions that are supported by electric and magnetic fluxes and by providing evidence for their instability. Finally, I investigate brane-like solutions in the presence of tadpole potentials that yield both flux vacua with the isometries of supersymmetric branes and gravitational profiles that capture the backreaction of localized sources.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Based Spectral Representations of Neutron-Star Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal parametric representations of neutron-star equations of state are constructed here using Chebyshev polynomial based spectral expansions. The accuracies of these representations are evaluated for a collection of model equations of state from a variety of nuclear-theory models and also a collection of equations of state with first- or second-order phase transitions of various sizes. These tests show that the Chebyshev based representations are convergent (even for equations of state with phase transitions) as the number of spectral basis functions is increased. This study finds that the Chebyshev based representations are generally more accurate than a previously studied power-law based spectral representation, and that pressure-based representations are generally more accurate than those based on enthalpy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Willmore energy as holographic entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum entanglement entropy of a general conformal field theory (CFT) in $d=5$ spacetime dimensions contains a universal term, $F(A)$, which has a complicated and non-local dependence on the geometric details of the region $A$ and the theory. Analogously to the previously known $d=3$ case, we prove that for CFTs in $d=5$ which are holographically dual to Einstein gravity, $F(A)$ is equal to a four-dimensional version of the ``Willmore energy'' associated to a doubled and closed version of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface of $A$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^5$. This generalized Willmore energy is shown to arise from a conformal-invariant codimension-two functional obtained by evaluating six-dimensional Conformal Gravity on the conically-singular orbifold of the replica trick. The new functional involves an integral over the doubled RT surface of a linear combination of three quartic terms in extrinsic curvatures and is free from ultraviolet divergences by construction. We verify explicitly the validity of our new formula for various entangling regions and argue that, as opposed to the $d=3$ case, $F(A)$ is not globally minimized by a round ball $A=\mathbb{B}^4$. Rather, $F(A)$ can take arbitrarily positive and negative values as a function of $A$. Hence, we conclude that the round ball is not a global minimizer of $F(A)$ for general five-dimensional CFTs.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Statistics of Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Waves</title>

Abstract: Recent detection of nHz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has stimulated intensive discussions about its physical origin. In principle, either supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) or processes in the early universe may be the sources. One key difference between the two lies in the statistics of the SGWB frequency power spectrum. In particular, the often assumed Gaussian random SGWB does not accurately describe the distribution of the collective SMBHB emission. In this work, we present a semi-analytical framework for calculating the non-Gaussian statistics of SGWB power expected from SMBHBs. We find that (a) wave interference between individual SMBHBs with indistinguishable observed frequencies and (b) the Poisson fluctuation of the source numbers, together shape the non-Gaussian statistics. Implementing the non-Gaussian statistics developed in this work, we investigate the sensitivity of current and future PTA datasets in distinguishing the origin of the SGWB through non-Gaussian information. Additionally, we find an interesting approximation of the non-Gaussian statistics, which has implications for accurately and practically treating non-Gaussianity in PTA Bayesian analyses.</description>

Abstract: The opening of the gravitational wave window has significantly enhanced our capacity to explore the universe's most extreme and dynamic sector. In the mHz frequency range, a diverse range of compact objects, from the most massive black holes at the farthest reaches of the Universe to the lightest white dwarfs in our cosmic backyard, generate a complex and dynamic symphony of gravitational wave signals. Once recorded by gravitational wave detectors, these unique fingerprints have the potential to decipher the birth and growth of cosmic structures over a wide range of scales, from stellar binaries and stellar clusters to galaxies and large-scale structures. The TianQin space-borne gravitational wave mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s, with an operational lifespan of five years. It will facilitate pivotal insights into the history of our universe. This document presents a concise overview of the detectable sources of TianQin, outlining their characteristics, the challenges they present, and the expected impact of the TianQin observatory on our understanding of them.</description>

      <title>Probing Lambda-Gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a novel detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of table-top experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately two orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by two orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment could establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behaviour of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a novel means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of AdS/CFT, gravitational shockwaves serve as a geometric manifestation of boundary quantum chaos. We study this connection in general diffeomorphism-invariant theories involving an arbitrary number of bosonic fields. Specifically, we demonstrate that theories containing spin-2 or higher-spin fields generally admit classical localized shockwave solutions on black hole backgrounds, whereas spin-0 and spin-1 theories do not. As in the gravitational case, these higher-spin shockwaves provide a means to compute the out-of-time-order correlator. Both the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity are found to universally agree with predictions from pole skipping. In particular, higher-spin fields lead to a Lyapunov exponent that violates the chaos bound and a butterfly velocity that may exceed the speed of light.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Methods for Circumbinary Disk Dynamics -- II: Inclined Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) To gain insight into the dynamical influence of a supermassive black hole binary on a circumbinary accretion disk, we investigate the binary and viscous torque densities throughout such a disk, with emphasis on the final density distribution, particularly the size and stability of the central gap between the binary and the inner edge of the disk. We limit ourselves to the simplified case of a massless viscous thin accretion disk under the influence of the gravitational potential from a binary system whose orbital plane is inclined relative to the disk. The orbital plane could be inclined if it is not coeval with the disk, or the black holes have spin angular momentum misaligned with respect to the disk's orbital angular momentum, so that the binary can precess to an inclined orientation. We employ 2D Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations to examine the influence of two model parameters: the mass ratio of the binary and the inclination angle between the binary and the disk. We investigate their impact on the density and torque distribution. In our analytical approach, we consider the stability of epicycles induced by the perturbative effect of the asymmetric inclined binary gravitational potential on Keplerian circular orbits. Through our simulations, we observe that certain configurations never attain a quasi-steady state, where the density profile averaged over many orbits stabilizes. This instability occurs when the inclination is close to 45 degrees. Furthermore, we identify configurations where there is never a persistent balance between the dynamical and viscous torque densities, as well as cases where the location of this balance oscillates or exhibits other time-dependent behavior over viscous timescales. These findings have implications for understanding both the expected gravitational-wave signal and electromagnetic counterparts from supermassive black hole binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to string sigma model whose target space is a T-dualized system from an integrable bi-hermitian space with isometry. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized almost complex structures keep integrable even though they become no longer covariantly constant.

      <title>Radial kinks in a Schwartzschild-like geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of a domain wall (kink) of the $\phi^4$ model in a radially symmetric environment defined by a gravity source. This source deforms the standard Euclidian metric into a Schwartzschild-like one. We introduce an effective model that accurately describes the dynamics of the kink center. This description works well even outside the perturbation region, i.e., even for large masses of the gravitating object. We observed that such a spherical domain wall surrounding a star-type object inevitably "collapses", i.e., shrinks in radius towards the origin and offer an understanding of the latter phenomenology. The relevant analysis is presented for a circular domain wall and a spherical one.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the aim of producing significant number of primordial black holes, over the past few years, there has been a considerable interest in examining models of inflation involving a single, canonical field, that permit a brief period of ultra slow roll. Earlier, we had examined inflationary magnetogenesis - achieved by breaking the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action through a coupling to the inflation - in situations involving departures from slow roll. We had found that a transition from slow roll to ultra slow roll inflation can lead to a strong blue tilt in the spectrum of the magnetic field over small scales and also considerably suppress its strength over large scales. In this work, we consider the scenario of pure ultra slow roll inflation and show that scale invariant magnetic fields can be obtained in such situations with the aid of a non-conformal coupling function that depends on the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Apart from the power spectrum, an important probe of the primordial magnetic fields are the three-point functions, specifically, the cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields. We calculate the three-point cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation for the new choice of the non-conformal coupling function. In particular, we examine the validity of the consistency condition that is expected to govern the three-point function in the squeezed limit and comment on the wider implications of the results we obtain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose simple quantitative criteria, based on counting statistics in resonant harmonic detectors, that probe the quantum mechanical character of radiation fields. They provide, in particular, practical means to test the null hypothesis that a given field is ``maximally classical'', i.e., accurately described by a coherent state. We suggest circumstances in which that hypothesis plausibly fails, notably including gravitational radiation involving non-linear or stochastic sourcing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the microscopic formulation of Landauer's principle, when information is deleted the Von Neumann entropy of the system gets reduced with a corresponding energy cost. Although within the same perspective the growth of the entropy should remain unconstrained we show that during quantum amplification the heat flow does restrict the increase of the Von Neumann entropy. When applied to the case of relic gravitons (with frequencies between the aHz region and the THz domain) the bounds obtained here set a limit on initial thermal gravitons and on the total duration of inflation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography: Bayesian reconstruction of the galaxy density informed by large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark sirens method combines gravitational waves and catalogs of galaxies to constrain the cosmological expansion history, merger rates and mass distributions of compact objects, and the laws of gravity. However, the incompleteness of galaxy catalogs means faint potential host galaxies are unobserved, and must be modeled to avoid inducing a bias. The majority of dark sirens analyses to date assume that the missing galaxies are distributed uniformly across the sky, which is clearly unphysical. We introduce a new Bayesian approach to the reconstruction of galaxy catalogs, which makes full use of our knowledge of large-scale structure. Our method quantifies the uncertainties on the estimated true galaxy number count in each voxel, and is marginalized over cosmological parameters and bias parameters. Crucially, our method further assesses the (absolute) magnitude distribution of galaxies, which is not known from the galaxy catalog itself. We present the details of our method and validate our approach on a galaxy catalog associated to the Millennium Simulation. The tools developed here generate physically-informed and robust host galaxy reconstructions, enabling more informative dark sirens analyses. Stage IV galaxy surveys will display greater redshift overlap with GW observations, whilst remaining incomplete -- emphasizing the importance of our work.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics, Phase Transition and Joule Thomson Expansion of 4-D Gauss-Bonnet AdS Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.08778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic and phase transition properties of asymptotically AdS black holes within Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, focusing on Joule Thomson expansion. Thermodynamics is studied in the extended phase space, where the cosmological constant serves as thermodynamic pressure. We observe that the black hole undergoes a phase transition similar to that of a van der Waals system. We analyze charged and neutral cases separately to distinguish the effect of charge and Gauss Bonnet parameter on critical behavior and examine the phase structure. We find that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter behaves similarly to black hole charge or spin, guiding the phase structure. To understand the underlying phase structure determined by the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha$, we introduce a new order parameter. We discover that the change in the conjugate variable to the Gauss-Bonnet parameter acts as an order parameter, demonstrating a critical exponent of $1/2$ in the vicinity of the critical point. Since the phase structure is analogous to that of a van der Waals fluid, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion of the black hole. We analytically study the Joule-Thomson expansion, focusing on three key characteristics: the Joule-Thomson coefficient, inversion curves, and isenthalpic curves. We obtain isenthalpic curves in the $T-P$ plane and illustrate the cooling-heating regions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Fluid Correspondence in Relativistic Fluids with Spin: From Madelung Form to Gravitational Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum-fluid correspondence in a charged relativistic fluid with intrinsic spin. We begin by examining the nonrelativistic case, showing that the inclusion of spin introduces a quantum correction to the classical fluid energy. This correction, coupled with Maxwell's equations, naturally leads to the Schr\"odinger equation in Madelung form. Building on this foundation, we extend the formalism to a relativistic perfect fluid, identifying the system's stress-energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis reveals that the trace of the quantum correction to this tensor corresponds to the energy density of an oscillator, with its frequency determined by the vorticity of the spin motion. We then use the stress-energy-momentum tensor to establish the relationship between the Ricci scalar curvature, as dictated by the Einstein field equations, and the fluid density in a static, spherically symmetric configuration. Lastly, we generalize the Madelung transformation to compressible Navier-Stokes flows with vorticity and viscosity by developing a tailored Clebsch representation of the velocity field. This theoretical framework offers potential applications for studying fluid-like systems with internal rotational degrees of freedom, commonly encountered in astrophysical settings.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the axial vector torsion-spin coupling effects in the framework of the Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity with the general Yang-Mills type Lagrangian. The dynamical equations for the ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' components of the torsion field variable are obtained in the general form and it is shown that the helicity density and the spin density of the electromagnetic field appear as the physical sources. The modified Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field are derived, and the electromagnetic wave propagation under the action of the uniform homogeneous torsion field is considered. We demonstrate the Faraday effect of rotation of the polarization for such a wave, and establish the strong bound on the possible cosmic axial torsion field from the astrophysical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-gravitating Higgs field of a scalar charge is studied for the case of an asymmetric scalar doublet containing, along with a canonical and a phantom component. It is shown that in the zero and first approximation of the smallness of the canonical and phantom scalar charges, the gravitational field of the scalar charge is described by the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric with a cosmological constant determined by the stable equilibrium point - the vacuum potential of the canonical Higgs field and the zero value of the scalar potential. An equation for the perturbation of the stable value of the potential is obtained and studied, and the asymptotic behavior in the near and far zones is found. The averaging of microscopic oscillations of the scalar field is carried out and it is shown that the sign of the contribution of microscopic oscillations to the macroscopic energy of the scalar field is completely determined by the values of the fundamental constants of the Higgs potential of the asymmetric scalar doublet. Particular attention is paid to the case when the contribution of oscillations to the macroscopic energy and pressure densities is strictly equal to zero. Possible applications of the obtained solutions are discussed.
  Keywords: scalarly charged black hole, asymmetric scalar doublet, scalar Higgs field, asymptotic behavior, macroscopic characteristics, doublet orientation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent evidence for stochastic gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations might open a new window for studying cosmology and astrophysical phenomena. In addition to signals from gravitational waves, there is motivation to explore residual signals from oscillating dark matter, which might partially comprise the galactic halo. We investigate fluctuations in pulsar timing originating from the coherent oscillation of scalar dark matter up to the subleading-order correction of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$, as well as from acoustic oscillations of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter. Both types of dark matter can induce the Newtonian potential and curvature perturbations, thereby affecting pulsar timing. We show distinctive signatures in pulsar timing residuals and angular correlations in the PTA frequency band and considering the known distances of pulsars. For scalar dark matter, both the timing residuals and the angular correlation are sensitive to small variations in the distance, $\delta L$, due to the subleading-order correction of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$. In contrast, for perfect fluid dark matter, it is insensitive to the $\delta L$. For deterministic source from scalar dark matter, the distance of a pulsar has influence on the degree of directional dependence of timing residuals, significantly. For stochastic source from perfect fluid dark matter, the angular correlation tends to a constant and enhances only when the pulsar pair is very close to each other. In this sense, perfect fluid dark matter is shown to be a more suitable physical origin for monopolar signals in angular correlations compared to the scalar dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the quasinormal modes of a nonsingular spherically symmetric black hole effective model with holonomy corrections. The model is based on quantum corrections inspired by loop quantum gravity. It is covariant and results in a spacetime that is regular everywhere with a parameter-dependent black bounce. Perturbations of these black holes due to massless scalar and electromagnetic fields have been previously calculated and some intriguing results were observed. For some modes, the frequency versus minimum-radius parameter trajectories were found to spiral and self-intersect in the complex plane. In addition, the spectrum of overtones has real frequencies that oscillate with increasing overtone number, and may even vanish for some overtones. We have calculated the quasinormal modes for all massless spin perturbations, including spin-1/2, and axial- and polar-gravitational. We find that the trajectory-spirals are restricted to scalar perturbations and observe some interesting overtone behaviour for gravitational perturbations. The amount of isospectrality violation in the gravitational quasinormal mode spectra is also examined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the acceleratingly expanding universe in the frame of Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and we study the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). This may describe the creation of the primordial black holes in the early stages of the universe and the impact of their creation on the propagation of primordial gravitational waves. The collapsing spacetime can be obtained by using the formulation of the ``reconstruction'', that is, we find a model that realises the desired or given geometry. In the reconstructed models, ghosts often appear, which could be eliminated by imposing constraints. We show that the standard cosmological solutions or self-gravitating objects such as a planet, the Sun, various types of stars, etc., in Einstein's gravity, are also solutions in this model. Using the dynamical value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the propagation of the high-frequency GW is investigated. The propagating speed changes due to the coupling during the period of the black hole formation. The speed of the GW propagation going into the black hole is different from that of the wave going out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflationary models with a non-zero background curvature require additional hypothesis or parameters compared to flat inflation and the procedure to construct them cannot be as simple as in the flat case. For this reason, there is no consensus on the primordial power spectrum that should be considered at large scales in a curved Universe. In this letter, we propose a model of curved inflation in which the usual canonical quantization and Bunch-Davies vacuum choice of the flat case can be considered. The framework is a recently proposed modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical topological term is added to the Einstein equation. The model is universal as it is the same for any background curvature, and no additional parameters or hypothesis on the initial spatial curvature are introduced. This gives a natural and simple solution to the problem of constructing curved inflation, and at the same time provides an additional argument for this topological modification of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Analytical proxy to families of numerical solutions: the case study of spherical mini-boson stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein field equations, or generalizations thereof, are difficult to solve analytically. On the other hand, numerical solutions of the same equations have become increasingly common, in particular concerning compact objects. Whereas analytic approximations to each individual solution within a numerical family have been proposed, proxies for whole families are missing, which can facilitate studying properties across the parameter space, data compression and a wider usage of such solutions. In this work we tackle this need, proposing a simple strategy based on two different expansions of the unknown functions in an appropriately chosen basis, to build such proxy. We use as an exploratory case-study spherical, fundamental mini-boson stars, to illustrate the feasibility of such an approach, emphasise its advantage in reducing the data size, and the challenges, say, in covering large parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Strong field behavior of Wang-Yau Quasi-local energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$ approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming that coordinate functions of the isometric embedding are bounded in $W^{2,1}$ and mean curvature vector of the image surface remains spacelike, we find that the limit falls in two exclusive cases: 1) If the horizon cannot be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up as $\Sigma$ approaches the horizon while the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for $\Sigma$ near the horizon; 2) If the horizon can be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the optimal embedding equation is solvable up to the horizon with the unique solution at the horizon corresponding to isometric embedding into $R^3$ and the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass admits a finite limit at the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmological stochastic backgrounds by notching out resolvable compact binary foregrounds with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds can be of either cosmological or astrophysical origin. The detection of an astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background with ground-based interferometers is expected in the near future. Perhaps even more excitingly, the detection of stochastic backgrounds of cosmological origin by future ground-based interferometers could reveal invaluable information about the early Universe. From this perspective, the astrophysical background is a {\it foreground} that can prevent the extraction of this information from the data. In this paper, we revisit a time-frequency domain notching procedure previously proposed to remove the astrophysical foreground in the context of next-generation ground-based detectors, but we consider the more realistic scenario where we remove individually detectable signals by taking into account the uncertainty in the estimation of their parameters. We find that time-frequency domain masks can still efficiently remove the astrophysical foreground and suppress it to about $5\%$ of its original level. Further removal of the foreground formed by unresolvable events (in particular, unresolvable binary neutron stars), which is about $10$ times larger than the residual foreground from realistic notching, would require detector sensitivity improvements. Therefore, the main limitation in the search for a cosmological background is the unresolvable foreground itself, and not the residual of the notching procedure.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11305v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance can be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with a second-generation TDI null stream $C^{12}_3$. The combined three data streams, including two science observables from the hybrid Relay and $C^{12}_3$, could reduce the instabilities of noise spectra in the targeting frequency band and form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>

      <title>Exploring the no-hair theorem with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the possibility of testing the no-hair theorem with gravitational waves from massive black hole binaries in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on its sensitivity, we consider LISA's ability to detect possible deviations from general relativity (GR) in the ringdown. Two approaches are considered: an agnostic quasi-normal mode (QNM) analysis, and a method explicitly targeting the deviations from GR for given QNMs. Both approaches allow us to find fractional deviations from general relativity as estimated parameters or by comparing the mass and spin estimated from different QNMs. However, depending on whether we rely on the prior knowledge of the source parameters from a pre-merger or inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) analysis, the estimated deviations may vary. Under some assumptions, the second approach targeting fractional deviations from GR allows us to recover the injected values with high accuracy and precision. We obtain $(5\%, 10\%)$ uncertainty on ($\delta \omega, \delta \tau)$ for the $(3,3,0)$ mode, and $(3\%, 17\%)$ for the $(4,4,0)$ mode. As each approach constrains different features, we conclude that combining both methods would be necessary to perform a better test. In this analysis, we also forecast the precision of the estimated deviation parameters for sources throughout the mass and distance ranges observable by LISA.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem of analog gravity systems II: Rotation and energy-dependent boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse problem of analog gravity systems which admit rotation and energy-dependent boundary conditions. By extending two recent results, we provide a recipe that allows one to relate resonant transmission spectra with effective potentials and even reconstruct the boundary condition at the core. Our methodology is based on the WKB method and the identification of universal features in the transmission. One of the main advantages of this method is that it is parameter-free, and relies only on general properties of the underlying potential, instead of specific models. While the reconstruction of underlying potentials is generally not uniquely possible, the inverse method provides effective potentials with similar spectral properties to the original one. To demonstrate the accuracy and scope of our method, we apply it to a rotating imperfect draining vortex, which has been proposed as an analog system to astrophysical extreme compact objects. We conclude that the capability to explore energy-dependent boundary conditions could be of interest for experimental studies of such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid scheme that allows high-order shock capturing with the discontinuous Galerkin method for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in dynamical spacetimes. We present several optimizations and stability improvements to our algorithm that allow the hybrid method to successfully simulate single, rotating, and binary neutron stars. The hybrid method achieves the efficiency of discontinuous Galerkin methods throughout almost the entire spacetime during the inspiral phase, while being able to robustly capture shocks and resolve the stellar surfaces. We also use Cauchy-Characteristic evolution to compute the first gravitational waveforms at future null infinity from binary neutron star mergers. The simulations presented here are the first successful binary neutron star inspiral and merger simulations using discontinuous Galerkin methods.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two types of static black hole models that retain general covariance have been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG). We have studied the light rings and shadows of these black holes using the topological method and the backward ray-tracing method, respectively. We demonstrate that these light rings in both types of static black holes are standard and unstable according to the classification of light rings. Subsequently, we checked the position of the light rings using the photon trajectory equation. We found that although the quantum parameters do not affect the light rings of these two types of black holes, they do reduce the size of the first type of static black hole in EQG, making it smaller. However, for the second type of static black hole in EQG, we cannot distinguish it from a Schwarzschild black hole based on the shadow alone. Fortunately, the quantum parameters shrink the lensing rings of both types of black holes in EQG, causing the black hole shadow to occupy a larger proportion within the ring. This can serve as a basis for distinguishing whether the black hole is in EQG or general relativity (GR).</description>

      <title>Constraining string cosmology with the gravitational-wave background using the NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) collaboration has recently reported strong evidence for a signal at nanohertz, potentially the first detection of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We investigate whether the NANOGrav signal is consistent with the SGWB predicted by string cosmology models. By performing Bayesian parameter estimation on the NANOGrav 15-year data set, we constrain the key parameters of a string cosmology model: the frequency $f_s$ and the fractional energy density $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s}$ of gravitational waves at the end of the dilaton-driven stage, and the Hubble parameter $H_r$ at the end of the string phase. Our analysis yields constraints of $f_s = 1.2^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\times 10^{-8} \mathrm{Hz}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s} = 2.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-8}$, consistent with theoretical predictions from string cosmology. However, the current NANOGrav data is not sensitive to the $H_r$ parameter. We also compare the string cosmology model to a simple power-law model using Bayesian model selection, finding a Bayes factor of $2.2$ in favor of the string cosmology model. Our results demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to constrain cosmological models and study the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Common origin for black holes in both high mass X-ray binaries and gravitational-wave sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-hole (BH) high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems are likely to be the progenitors of BH-BH mergers detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK). Yet merging BHs reach higher masses ($\sim 100M_{\odot}$) than BHs in HMXBs ($\sim 20 M_{\odot}$) and exhibit lower spins ($a_{\rm BH}\lesssim 0.25$ with a larger values tail) than what is often claimed for BHs in HMXBs ($a_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 0.9$). This could suggest that these two classes of systems belong to different populations, but here we show that this may not necessarily be the case. The difference in masses is easily explained as the known HMXB-BHs are in galaxies with relatively high metallicity, so their progenitor stars are subject to strong mass loss from winds, leading to relatively low-mass BH at core collapse. Conversely, LVK is also able to detect BHs from low-metallicity galaxies that produce more massive stellar-origin BHs. The difference in spin is more difficult to explain. Models with efficient angular momentum transport in stellar interiors produce slowly spinning progenitors for both LVK and HMXB BHs. Known HMXBs have orbital periods that are too long for tidal spin-up and are unlikely to have undergone significant accretion spin-up. Instead, we show that the derived value of the BH spin depends strongly on how the HMXB accretion disc emission is modelled. We argue that since Cyg X-1 is never observed in a soft state, the appropriate spectral models must take into account the Comptonisation of the disc photosphere. We show that such models are consistent with low spin values, namely: $a_{\rm BH}\sim 0.1$. This was confirmed by other teams for both Cyg X-1 and LMC X-1 and we show this is also the case for M33 X-7. We conclude that all HMXB BHs can exhibit low spins, in accordance with stellar evolution models. Hence, the observations are consistent with the LVK BHs and HMXB BHs belonging to the same population.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Flatness Nature of Noncommutative Minkowski Spacetime and the Singular Behavior of Probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is more than a century-old concept that the Minkowski spacetime is flat. From the pure geometric point of view, we explicitly address the issue of whether a noncommutative Minkowski spacetime is flat or not. In the framework of the twisted-diffeomorphism approach to noncommutative gravity with canonical type noncommutative (NC) coordinate structure, one important result that we get is that the NC Minkowski spacetime parametrized either with spherical polar coordinates or with parabolic coordinates has nontrivial NC corrections to Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor and curvature scalars. Another crucial result is that the curvature scalars have singular behavior at certain points, and these singularities are not coordinate singularities. The nature of these singularities clearly points towards the idea of high-energetic probes turning into black holes. The absence of any such noncommutative corrections, and thus any such singularities, in the cases of Cartesian coordinates and cylindrical coordinates leads to the conclusion that high-energetic probes do not turn into black holes when the canonical NC structure is considered for these coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Born rule describes the probability of obtaining an outcome when measuring an observable of a quantum system. As it can only be tested by measuring many copies of the system under consideration, it does not hold for non-replicable systems. For these systems, we give a procedure to predict the future statistics of measurement outcomes through Repeated Measurements (RM). This is done by extending the validity of quantum mechanics to those systems admitting no replicas; we prove that if the statistics of the results acquired by performing RM on such systems is sufficiently similar to that obtained by the Born rule, the latter can be used effectively. We apply our framework to a repeatedly measured Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar quantum field, which is an example of a system (detector) interacting with an uncontrollable environment (field) for which using RM is necessary. Analysing what an observer learns from the RM outcomes, we find a regime where history-dependent RM probabilities are close to the Born ones. Consequently, the latter can be used for all practical purposes. Finally, we numerically study inertial and accelerated detectors, showing that an observer can see the Unruh effect via RM.</description>

Abstract: The present article deals with general mechanics in an unconventional manner. At first, Newtonian mechanics for a point particle has been described in vectorial picture, considering Cartesian, polar and tangent-normal formulations in a unified manner. An extensive differential geometric notions have been used when motion on curved surfaces has been considered. Both the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulations have been discussed with various examples. The relevant part of the calculus of variation has been presented in the appendix. Also, a detailed study about the nature of the Lagrangian has been shown in the appendix and it has been found that the usual Lagrangian can be extended to curved space-time using the notion of differential geometry. The article may be suitable both for undergraduate and postgraduate students.</description>

      <title>Accurate Computation of the Screening of Scalar Fifth Forces in Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms allow light scalar fields to dynamically avoid the constraints that come from our lack of observation of a long-range fifth force. Galactic scale tests are of particular interest when the light scalar is introduced to explain the dark matter or dark energy that dominates our cosmology. To date, much of the literature that has studied screening in galaxies has described screening using simplifying approximations. In this work, we calculate numerical solutions for scalar fields with screening mechanisms in galactic contexts, and use these to derive new, precise conditions governing where fifth forces are screened. We show that the commonly used binary screened/unscreened threshold can predict a fifth force signal in situations where a fuller treatment does not, leading us to conclude that existing constraints might be significantly overestimated. We show that various other approximations of the screening radius provide a more accurate proxy to screening, although they fail to exactly reproduce the true screening surface in certain regions of parameter space. As a demonstration of our scheme, we apply it to an idealised Milky Way and thus identify the region of parameter space in which the solar system is screened.</description>

Abstract: Early matter-dominated eras (EMDEs) are a natural feature arising in many models of the early universe and can generate a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) during the transition from an EMDE to the radiation-dominated universe required by the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. While there are calculations of the SGWB generated in the linear regime, no detailed study has been made of the nonlinear regime. We perform the first comprehensive calculation of GW production in the nonlinear regime, using a hybrid $N$-body and lattice simulation to study GW production from both a metastable matter species and the radiation produced in its decay. We find that nonlinearities significantly enhance GW production up to frequencies at least as large as the inverse light-crossing time of the largest halos that form prior to reheating. The resulting SGWB is within future observational reach for curvature perturbations as small as those probed in the cosmic microwave background, depending on the reheating temperature. Out-of-equilibrium dynamics could further boost the induced SGWB, while a fully relativistic gravitational treatment is required to resolve the spectrum at even higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic microwave background constraints on extended dark matter objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordially formed extended dark objects would accrete baryonic matter and impact the ionisation history of the Universe. Insisting on consistency with the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, we derive constraints on the dark matter fraction for various classes of objects, of different sizes. We introduce a novel scaling technique to speed up numerical calculations and release our calculation framework in the form of a Mathematica notebook. Conservatively, we focus on spherical accretion and collisional ionisation. We find strong constraints limiting the dark matter fraction to subpercent level for objects of up to $10^4$ AU in size.</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars I: Structure, shape and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full general relativistic analytic solution for a radiation-pressure supported equilibrium fluid torus orbiting a rotating neutron star (NS). Previously developed analytical methods are thoroughly applied in the Hartle-Thorne geometry, including the effects of both the NS's angular momentum and quadrupole moment. The structure, size and shape of the torus are explored, focusing especially on the critically thick solution - the cusp tori. For the astrophysically relevant range of NS parameters, we examine how our findings differ from those obtained for the Schwarzschild spacetime. The solutions for rotating stars display signatures of the interplay between relativistic and Newtonian effects where the impact of NS angular momentum and quadrupole moment are almost counterbalanced at the given radius. Nevertheless, the spacetime parameters still strongly influence the size of tori, which can be shown in a coordinate-independent way. Finally, we discuss the importance of the size of the central NS, determining whether or not the surrounding torus may exist. We provide a set of tools in a Wolfram Mathematica code, which poses a basis allowing for a further investigation of the impact of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state on the spectral and temporal behaviour of accretion tori.</description>

      <title>Climbing over the potential barrier during inflation via null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) may play a crucial role in enabling a scalar field to climb over high potential barriers, potentially significant in the very early universe. We propose a single-field model where the universe sequentially undergoes a first stage of slow-roll inflation, NEC violation, and a second stage of slow-roll inflation. Through the NEC violation, the scalar field climbs over high potential barriers, leaving unique characteristics on the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum, including a blue-tilted nature in the middle-frequency range and diminishing oscillation amplitudes at higher frequencies. Additionally, the power spectrum exhibits nearly scale-invariant behavior on both large and small scales.</description>

      <title>Robust $\mu$-distortion constraints on primordial supermassive black holes from non-Gaussian perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining the origin of supermassive black holes via a primordial origin is severely challenged by the tight spectral distortion constraints on the amplitude of the primordial perturbations. Following the first calculation of how the $\mu$ constraints are modified by non-Gaussianity in a companion paper, we here make the first robust constraints on primordial black hole formation under large non-Gaussianity. Even the infinite $f_{\rm NL}$ limit is insufficiently non-Gaussian but much higher-order non-Gaussianity of the form ${\cal R}={\cal R}_{\rm G}^5$ may allow the formation of any mass primordial black hole without conflicting with distortion constraints. We caution that such extreme models face other challenges.</description>

      <title>Extracting parity-violating gravitational waves from projected tidal force tensor in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) may be produced by various mechanisms in the early universe. In particular, if parity is violated, it may lead to the production of parity-violating GWs. In this paper, we focus on GWs on the scale of the large-scale structure. Since GWs induce tidal deformations of the shape of galaxies, one can extract such GW signals by observing images of galaxies in galaxy surveys. Conventionally the detection of such signals is discussed by considering the three-dimensional power spectra of the $E/B$-modes. Here, we develop a complementary new technique to estimate the contribution of GWs to the tidal force tensor field projected on the celestial sphere, which is a directly observable quantity. We introduce two two-dimensional vector fields constructed by taking the divergence and curl of the projected tidal field in three dimensions. Their auto-correlation functions naturally contain contributions of the scalar-type tidal field. However, we find that the divergence of the curl of the projected tidal field, which is a pseudo-scalar quantity, is free from the scalar contribution and thus enables us to extract GW signals. We also find that we can detect parity-violating signals in the GWs by observing the nonzero cross-correlation between the divergence of the projected tidal field and the curl of it. It roughly corresponds to measuring the cross-power spectrum of E and B-modes, but these are complementary to each other in the sense that our estimator can be naturally defined locally in position space. Finally we present expressions of the correlation functions in the form of Fourier integrals, and discuss the properties of the kernels specific to the GW case, which we call the overlap reduction function, borrowing the terminology used in the pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>Constrain the linear scalar perturbation theory of Cotton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a cosmological test of Cotton gravity, which describes gravity by cotton tensor. We assume in Cotton gravity the background evolution is the same as the flat FLRW background. We derive the cosmological perturbation theory of the scalar mode at the linear level, where the difference from the $\Lambda$CDM model is characterized by the parameter $\beta$. We incorporate Cotton gravity with a neutrino model and perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis using data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The analysis constrains parameter $\beta=-0.00008^{+0.00080}_{-0.00104}$ at the 1-$\sigma$ confidence level. We conclude that currently, there is no obvious deviation between Cotton gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear cosmological perturbation level for observations.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of ultralight bosons around compact objects: in-medium suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixing between ultralight bosons and the Standard Model photon may allow access to the hitherto invisible Universe. In the presence of plasma, photons are dressed with an effective mass which will influence the conversion between the two. We study this phenomenon, known as in-medium suppression, in the context of black hole physics. We consider both axion-photon mixing around charged black holes and dark photon-photon mixing around neutral black holes. We find that the presence of plasma indeed influences the conversion rate, possibly quenching it altogether for large plasma densities, and discuss implications for superradiance and observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Generalized flow-composed symplectic methods for post-Newtonian Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the nonseparability of the post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian systems of compact objects, the symplectic methods that admit the linear error growth and the near preservation of first integrals are always implicit as explicit symplectic methods have not been currently found for general nonseparable Hamiltonian systems. Since the PN Hamiltonian has a particular formulation that includes a dominant Newtonian part and a perturbation PN part, we present the generalized flow-composed Runge--Kutta (GFCRK) method with a free parameter $\lambda$ to PN Hamiltonian systems. It is shown that the GFCRK method is symplectic once the underlying RK method is symplectic, and it is symmetric once the underlying RK method is symmetric under the setting $\lambda=1/2$. Numerical experiments with the 2PN Hamiltonian of spinning compact binaries demonstrate the higher accuracy and efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the underlying symplectic RK method in the case of weak PN effect. Meanwhile, the numerical results also support higher efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the semi-explicit mixed symplectic method of the same order.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically-defined higher-derivative Carrollian scalar field theories without Ostrogradsky instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the most generic Carrollian higher derivative free scalar field theory intrinsically on a Carrollian manifold. The solutions to these theories are massless free particles propagating with speeds depending on the coupling constants in the Lagrangian, thus, allowing interference solutions which are not allowed on a Lorentzian manifold. This demonstrates that the set of solutions to the Carrollian theories is much larger than that of their Lorentzian counterparts. We also show that Carrollian higher derivative theories are more resistant to Ostrogradsky's instabilities. These instabilities can be resolved by choosing the coupling constants appropriately in the Carrollian Lagrangian, something that was proven to be impossible in Lorentzian theories.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of common envelope stage in close binary systems: comparison between Newtonian and modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the important stage in evolution of close binary system namely common envelope phase in framework of various models of modified gravity. The comparison of results between calculations in Newtonian gravity and modified gravity allows to estimate possible observational imprints of modified gravity. Although declination from Newtonian gravity should be negligible we can propose that due to the long times some new effects can appear. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO for numerical simulation of binary system consisting of $\sim M_{\odot}$ white dwarf and a red giant with mass $\sim 2 M_{\odot}$. For implementing modified gravity into AREPO code we apply the method of (pseudo)potential, assuming that modified gravity can be described by small corrections to usual Newtonian gravitational potential. As in Newtonian case initial orbit has to shrink due to the energy transfer to the envelope of a giant. We investigated evolution of common envelope in a case of simple model of modified gravity with various values of parameters and compared results with simulation in frames of Newtonian gravity.</description>
