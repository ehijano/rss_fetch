      <title>Conformality Thresholds in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense-matter equation of state (EOS) under neutron-star conditions is investigated. We focus on the qualitative behavior of the speed of sound and its average. We characterize and compare the theoretical criteria for identifying nearly conformal matter. We find that the consistency of these criteria in determining the onset of conformal matter is dictated by the combined state-of-the-art theoretical and astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Stochastic baryon charge transport in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize 3+1D stochastic hydrodynamics to study correlations and fluctuations of baryon charge in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The baryon charge fluctuations are important observables to probe the QCD phase diagram, yet a dynamical description with stochastic hydrodynamics remains challenging due to numerical instabilities and high computational demands. In this work, we employ a linearized approach, allowing us to separately simulate the background energy-momentum evolution of a charge-neutral fluid and the stochastic baryon transport processes, thereby largely reducing computational cost while maintaining sufficient accuracy. We implement this linearized stochastic charge evolution in the viscous hydrodynamic code MUSIC, and find that it nicely describes the two-point correlation of 1+1D analytical solutions for various equations of state and transport coefficients. In particular, the hydrodynamic calculations demonstrate how different rapidity separations probe charge fluctuations originating at different times of the evolution. We also investigate the net baryon correlations after the Cooper--Frye freeze out, which show good consistency with the analytical calculations and indicate that these fluctuation-induced correlations are sensitive to the baryon diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamical Microscopic Approach to Stellar Carbon Burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of carbon burning is vital to understanding late stage stellar evolution of massive stars and the conditions of certain supernovae. Carbon burning is a complex problem, involving quantum tunnelling and nuclear molecular states. Quantum dynamical calculations of carbon burn- ing are presented, combining the time-dependent wave-packet method and the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) approach. By limiting the contribution of triaxial molec- ular configurations to fusion, we demonstrate that the DC-TDHF interaction potential successfully explains the appearance of some resonant structures in the sub-barrier fusion cross-section. This result shows the critical role of nucleon-nucleon interactions in the 12C + 12C fusion resonances observed at astrophysical energies.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fusion Enhancement by Heavy Nuclear Catalysts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We seek to understand the effect of high electron density in the proximity of a heavy nucleus on the fusion reaction rates in a hot plasma phase. We investigate quantitatively the catalytic effect of gold ($Z=79$) ions embedded in an electron plasma created due to plasmonic focusing of high-intensity short laser pulses. Using self-consistent strong plasma screening, we find highly significant changes in the internuclear potential of light elements present nearby. For gold, we see a $14\,$keV change in the internuclear potential near the nuclear surface, independent of the long-distance thermal Debye-H\"uckel screening. The dense polarization cloud of electrons around the gold catalyst leads to a $\sim 1.5$ enhancement of proton-boron ($^{11}$B) fusion above $T=100\,$keV.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD constraints on the critical point from an improved precision equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter we employ lattice simulations to search for the critical point of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We search for the onset of a first order QCD transition on the phase diagram by following contours of constant entropy density from imaginary to real chemical potentials under conditions of strangeness neutrality. We scan the phase diagram and investigate whether these contours meet to determine the probability that the critical point is located in a certain region on the $T-\mu_B$ plane. To achieve this we introduce a new, continuum extrapolated equation of state at zero density with improved precision using lattices with $N_\tau=8,10,12,16$ timeslices, and supplement it with new data at imaginary chemical potential. The current precision allows us to exclude, at the $2\sigma$ level, the existence of a critical point at $\mu_B &lt; 450$~MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the complex potential of quarkonium at high temperatures, quarkonium has been regarded as an open quantum system in the quark-gluon plasma. Recently, a similar issue regarding in-medium bound states of impurities has also emerged in particle physics and cold atomic physics. We will provide an overview of recent advancements in understanding key quantities such as complex potential and transport coefficients for heavy impurities in finite temperature QCD and cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavor multimodal fragmentation to $S$-wave pentacharms at next-generation hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the leading-power fragmentation of fully charmed pentaquark states ($S$-wave $|c\bar{c}ccc\rangle$ pentacharms) at hadron colliders. We introduce a new set of hadron-structure-oriented, multimodal collinear fragmentation functions, named PQ5Q1.0. They rely on an enhanced calculation of the initial-scale input for the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel, making them well suited to describe the short-distance emission of either a compact multicharm state or a dicharm-charm-dicharm configuration. To explore phenomenological implications, we use the (sym)JETHAD multimodular interface to study NLL/NLO$^+$ semi-inclusive production rates for pentacharm-plus-jet systems at the forthcoming HL-LHC and the future FCC. Our analysis represents a further step toward bridging the domains of hadronic structure, precision QCD, and exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of Energy-energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-energy correlators (EECs) within high energy jets serve as a key experimentally accessible quantity to probe the scale and structure of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The CMS Collaboration's first measurement of the modification to the EEC within single inclusive jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions reveals a significant enhancement at small angles, which may arise from jet transverse momentum $p_T$ selection biases due to jet energy loss. We investigate the dependence of jet EECs on the flavor of the initiating parton. The EEC distribution of a gluon jet is broader and the peak of transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regime occurs at a larger angle than a quark jet. Such flavor dependence leads to the different EECs for $\gamma$-jets and single inclusive jets due to their different flavor composition. It is also responsible for a colliding energy dependence of EECs of single inclusive jets at fixed jet energy. We also investigate the impact of flavor composition variation on the $p_T$ dependence of the jet EEC. We further propose that a change in the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions compared to p+p can also contribute to a non-negligible enhancement of the medium modified EEC at small angles. Using the \textsc{Jewel} model, we predict the reduction of the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions and estimate its impact on the EEC.</description>

      <title>Constraining first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with application of Bayesian techniques on PSR J0437-4715 NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multimessenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437$-$4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437$-$4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, concincide with the rough mass range of PSR J0437$-$4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437$-$4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Pion Electroproduction and Weak Production from a Nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in QCD influence nucleon structure and interactions, with pion production serving as a key probe of chiral dynamics. In this study, we present a lattice QCD calculation of multipole amplitudes at threshold, related to both pion electroproduction and weak production from a nucleon, using two gauge ensembles near the physical pion mass. We develop a technique for spin projection and construct multiple operators for analyzing the generalized eigenvalue problem in both the nucleon-pion system in the center-of-mass frame and the nucleon system with nonzero momentum. The numerical lattice results are then compared with those extracted from experimental data and predicted by low-energy theorems incorporating one-loop corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we extend the MIT bag model by incorporating the vector interaction among quarks and introducing a density-dependent bag pressure.Then we proceed to investigate the thermodynamic properties of strange quark matter (SQM) and pure up-down quark matter (udQM) in quark stars (QSs).Our findings demonstrate that the density dependence of bag pressure $B(n_b)$ and the vector interaction $G_V$ among quarks can significantly stiffen the equation of state (EOS) for both SQM and udQM which allows for the description of massive compact stars such as those observed in GW190814 and PSR J0740+6620 as plausible candidates for QSs.Ultimately, we derived a series of mass-radius relations of QS based on several combinations of ($B_{as}$, $\beta$). Our results support the hypothesis that HESS J1731-347 is a quark star.</description>

Abstract: We present a comparison of directed and elliptic flow data by the FOPI collaboration in Au--Au, Xe--CsI, and Ni--Ni collisions at beam kinetic energies from 0.25 to 1.5 GeV per nucleon to simulations using the SMASH hadronic transport model. The Equation of State is parameterized as a function of nuclear density and momentum dependent potentials are newly introduced in SMASH. With a statistical analysis, we show that within the present status of the SMASH transport model, the collective flow data at lower energies is in the best agreement with a soft momentum dependent potential, while the elliptic flow at higher energies requires a harder momentum dependent Equation of State.</description>

      <title>Universal Wong formula for capture cross sections from light to super-heavy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal Wong formula is proposed with refined model parameters for a systematic description of the capture cross sections for heavy-ion fusion reactions from C+C to Ni+U, in which the barrier parameters and the barrier distribution are determined by the entrance-channel nucleus-nucleus potential based on the Skyrme energy density functional. With introducing a constraint to the width of the barrier distribution and a pocket-depth dependent barrier radius, the capture excitation functions for a number of fusion reactions involving different nuclear structure effects are remarkably well reproduced, particularly for the reactions between light nuclei and those forming super-heavy nuclei. The systematic decreasing behavior of the geometric radii with the depth of capture pocket due to the influence of deep inelastic scattering is clearly observed in the TDHF calculations for super-heavy systems. The predicted capture cross sections for $^{54}$Cr + $^{238}$U at above barrier energies are evidently smaller than the corresponding results of more asymmetric projectile-target combination $^{50}$Ti + $^{242}$Pu due to the shallower capture pocket in Cr+U.</description>

      <title>Moments of inertia of rare-earth nuclei and the nuclear time-odd mean fields within exact solutions of the adiabatic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically analyse the nuclear moments of inertia determined within the Skyrme and Gogny density functional theories. The time-odd mean fields generated by collective rotation are self-consistently determined by a novel exact iterative solution of the adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) equations. Although details of the results depend on the functional used, the calculated moments of inertia are in good overall agreement with the experimental data, with no adjustable parameters. To show the essential importance of the time-odd mean fields, we compared the ATDHFB moments of inertia with those obtained from the Inglis-Belyaev formula. For Skyrme density functionals, we find strong correlations between the effective mass and the impact of the time-odd mean fields on the inertia's rotational and vibrational moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

Abstract: Using the colour dipole picture of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we study semi-inclusive jet production in DIS at small $x$ in the limit where the photon virtuality $Q^2$ is much larger than the transverse momentum squared $P_\perp^2$ of the produced jet. In this limit, the cross-section is dominated by aligned jet configurations, that is, quark-antiquark pairs in which one of the fermions -- the would-be struck quark in the Breit frame -- carries most of the longitudinal momentum of the virtual photon. We show that physically meaningful jet definitions in DIS are such that the effective axis of the jet sourced by the struck quark is controlled by its virtuality rather than by its transverse momentum. For such jet definitions, we show that the next-to-leading order (NLO) cross-section admits factorisation in terms of the (sea) quark transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution, which in turn satisfies a universal Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi and Sudakov evolution.</description>

      <title>Finding Interaction Mechanism between Exotic Molecule and Conventional Hadron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An intriguing and important question arises: how do hadronic molecules interact with conventional hadrons? In this work, we propose a novel mechanism to address this issue, focusing on the interactions between hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks ($P_c$) and nucleons ($N$). By applying this mechanism, we derive the corresponding interaction potentials, enabling the prediction of the bound state properties. Our results indicate the possible existence of $P_cN$ bound states-an entirely new form of matter, ripe for exploration in the era of high-precision hadron spectroscopy. Notably, this mechanism extends beyond the $P_cN$ systems and can be applied to any hadronic molecules interacting with conventional hadrons, offering the potential for discovering a variety of novel bound states.</description>

      <title>Elastic Dijet Production in Electron Scattering on a Longitudinally Polarized Proton at Small $x$: A Portal to Orbital Angular Momentum Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the elastic production of dijets from electron collisions with a longitudinally polarized proton target at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable. Building on the pioneering proposals of \cite{Hatta:2016aoc,Bhattacharya:2022vvo, Bhattacharya:2023hbq, Bhattacharya:2024sck} for measuring the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions, our focus is on both the longitudinal double spin asymmetry (DSA) and longitudinal single spin asymmetry (SSA). We compute the numerators of these asymmetries in the small-$x$ formalism of the light-cone operator treatment. Utilizing the small-$x$ expressions for the OAM distributions derived in our earlier paper, we demonstrate that the DSA provides a robust probe for both the quark and gluon OAM distributions within the proton. In contrast, we find that while the SSA is also sensitive to the OAM distributions, extraction of the latter from the SSA would require new developments in small-$x$ theory and phenomenology, and is probably not feasible at this point in time. These findings highlight the potential of DSA measurements in elastic dijet production at the future Electron-Ion Collider to provide the first-ever direct access to the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small $x$, paving the way for new insights into the proton spin puzzle.</description>

      <title>Luminosity predictions for the first three ionisation stages of W, Pt and Au to probe potential sources of emission in kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large number of R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation for heavy elements (Z &gt; 70) have been performed in recent years for applications in fusion and astrophysics research. With the expanding interest in heavy ions due to kilonova (KN) events such as AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi, this new data can be utilised for the diagnosis and study of observed KN spectra. In this work recently computed electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths are used, for the first three ionisation stages of tungsten (W, Z = 74), platinum (Pt, Z = 78) and gold (Au, Z = 79), to construct basic collisional radiative models tailored for the late stage nebular phases of KN. Line luminosities are calculated at a range of electron temperatures and densities and the strengths of these lines for a representative ion mass are compared. For the case of W III, these optically thin intensities are additionally used to constrain the mass of this ion in both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi. Comparing with theoretical predictions of nucleosynthesis yields from neutron-star merger simulations, broad agreement with the inferred ion masses of W is found. Furthermore, we highlight the value of W measurements by showing that the abundance of other groups of elements and outflow properties are constrained by exploiting theoretically motivated correlations between the abundance of W and that of lanthanides or third r-process peak elements. Based on simple estimates, we also show that constraints on the distribution of tungsten in the ejecta may be accessible through the line shape, which may also yield information on the neutron-star merger remnant evolution.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective theory of scalar and vector diquarks revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory of light diquarks is revisited. We construct an effective Lagrangian based on the linear representation of three-flavor chiral symmetry. Here, we focus on the effect of a chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetric term originated from an eight-point quark interaction. From this model, we obtain the mass formulas of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector diquarks, which also describe the dependence of diquark masses on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the $U(1)_A$ anomaly. We regard singly heavy baryons as two-body systems composed of one heavy quark and one diquark and then predict the fate of the mass spectrum and the strong decay widths under chiral symmetry restoration.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>PSR J1231-1411 revisited: Pulse Profile Analysis of X-ray Observation</title>

Abstract: One of the primary goals of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)-like X-ray missions is to impose stringent constraints on the neutron star equation of state by precisely measuring their masses and radii. NICER has recently expanded the dataset of inferred mass-radius relations for neutron stars, including four rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437-4715, and PSR J1231-1411. In this work, the mass-radius relation and X-ray emitting region properties of PSR J1231-1411 are inferred with an independent pulse profile modeling based on the spherical star Schwarzschild-spacetime and Doppler approximation. With one single-temperature elongated hot spot and one single-temperature crescent hot spot, the inferred gravitational mass is $M = 1.12 \pm 0.07 M_{\odot}$ and the inferred equatorial radius is $R_{eq} = 9.91_{-0.86}^{+0.88}$ km (68% credible intervals). It provides an alternative geometry configuration of the X-ray emitting region for PSR J1231-1411 to sufficiently explain the observation data of NICER and XMM-Newton. The inferred radius is smaller than that derived by \citet{salmi2024nicer} ($M = 1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05} M_{\odot}$, $R_{eq} = 12.6 \pm 0.3$ km), and the inferred mass is slightly higher in this work. The inferred geometry configurations of the X-ray emitting region in both works are non-antipodal, which is not consistent with a centered dipole magnetic field and suggests a complex magnetic field structure.</description>
