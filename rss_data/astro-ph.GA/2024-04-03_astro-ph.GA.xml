      <title>Resolving the nature and putative nebular emission of GS9422: an obscured AGN without exotic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the sources that power nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies is fundamentally important not only for shedding light onto the drivers of reionisation, but to constrain stellar populations and the growth of black holes. Here we focus on an individual object, GS9422, a galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=5.943$ with exquisite data from the JADES and JEMS surveys, including 14-band JWST/NIRCam photometry and deep NIRSpec prism and grating spectroscopy. We map the continuum emission and nebular emission lines across the galaxy on 0.2-kpc scales. GS9422 has been claimed to have nebular-dominated continuum and an extreme stellar population with top-heavy initial mass function. We find clear evidence for different morphologies in the emission lines, the rest-UV and rest-optical continuum emission, demonstrating that the full continuum cannot be dominated by nebular emission. While multiple models reproduce the spectrum reasonably well, our preferred model with a type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and local damped Ly-$\alpha$ (DLA) clouds can explain both the spectrum and the wavelength-dependent morphology. The AGN powers the off-planar nebular emission, giving rise to the Balmer jump and the emission lines, including Ly-$\alpha$, which therefore does not suffer DLA absorption. A central, young stellar component dominates the rest-UV emission and -- together with the DLA clouds -- leads to a spectral turn-over. A disc-like, older stellar component explains the flattened morphology in the rest-optical continuum. We conclude that GS9422 is consistent with being a normal galaxy with an obscured, type-2 AGN -- a simple scenario, without the need for exotic stellar populations.</description>

      <title>The JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey. A JWST/NIRSpec reference sample for the physical properties and Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption and emission of $\sim 500$ galaxies at $z=5.5-13.4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the surprising early findings with JWST has been the discovery of a strong "roll-over" or a softening of the absorption edge of Ly$\alpha$ in a large number of galaxies at ($z\gtrsim 6$), in addition to systematic offsets from photometric redshift estimates and fundamental galaxy scaling relations. This has been interpreted as damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) wings from high column densities of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI), signifying major gas accretion events in the formation of these galaxies. To explore this new phenomenon systematically, we assemble the JWST/NIRSpec PRImordial gas Mass AssembLy (PRIMAL) legacy survey of 494 galaxies at $z=5.5-13.4$. We characterize this benchmark sample in full and spectroscopically derive the galaxy redshifts, metallicities, star-formation rates, and ultraviolet slopes. We define a new diagnostic, the Ly$\alpha$ damping parameter $D_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ to measure and quantify the Ly$\alpha$ emission strength, HI fraction in the IGM, or local HI column density for each source. The JWST-PRIMAL survey is based on the spectroscopic DAWN JWST Archive (DJA-Spec). All the software, reduced spectra, and spectroscopically derived quantities and catalogs are made publicly available in dedicated repositories. The fraction of strong galaxy DLAs are found to be in the range $65-95\%$ at $z&gt;5.5$. The fraction of strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) is found to increase with decreasing redshift, in qualitative agreement with previous observational results, and are predominantly associated with low-metallicity and UV faint galaxies. By contrast, strong DLAs are observed in galaxies with a variety of intrinsic physical properties. Our results indicate that strong DLAs likely reflect a particular early assembly phase of reionization-era galaxies, at which point they are largely dominated by pristine HI gas accretion.

      <title>Complex Velocity Structure of Nebular Gas in Active Galaxies Centred in Cooling X-ray Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [OII] emission maps obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) are presented for four galaxies lying at the centers of cooling X-ray cluster atmospheres. Nebular emission reaching altitudes of tens of kpc is found in systems covering a broad range of atmospheric cooling rates, cluster masses, and dynamical states. The central galaxy in Abell 262 hosts high angular momentum gas in a kpc-scale disk. The nebular gas in RXJ0820.9+0752 is offset and redshifted with respect to the central galaxy by $10-20$ kpc and $150$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The nebular gas in PKS 0745-191 and Abell 1835, both experiencing strong radio-mechanical feedback, is being churned to higher velocity dispersion by the buoyantly rising bubbles and jets. Churning gas flows, likely outflows behind the rising radio bubbles, are likely driven by buoyancy and ram pressure due to the galaxies' motion with respect to the gas. The churned gas is enveloped by larger scale, lower velocity dispersion quiescent nebular emission. The mean radial speeds of the churned gas, quiescent gas, and the central galaxy each differ by up to $\sim 150$ km s$^{-1}$, although speeds upward of $800$ km s$^{-1}$ are found. Nebular gas is dynamically complex due to feedback, motion of the central galaxy, and perhaps relative motion of the hot atmosphere from which it presumably condensed. These motions will affect thermally unstable cooling models, the dispersal of jet energy, and the angular momentum of gas accreting onto the galaxy and its nuclear black hole.</description>

      <title>Core to ultracompact HII region evolution in the W49A massive protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to identify and characterize cores in the high-mass proto-cluster W49, determine their evolutionary stages and measure the associated lifetimes. We built a catalog of 129 cores extracted from an ALMA 1.3 mm continuum image at 0.26" (2900 au) angular resolution. The association between cores and Hyper/Ultra Compact HII (H/UC HII) regions was established from the analysis of VLA 3.3 cm continuum and H30$\alpha$ line observations. We also looked for emission of hot molecular cores (HMCs) using the methyl formate doublet at 218.29 GHz. We identified 40 cores associated with an H/UC HII region and 19 HMCs over the ALMA mosaic. The 52 cores with an H/UC HII region and/or a HMC are assumed to be high-mass protostellar cores, while the rest of the core population likely consists in prestellar cores and low-mass protostellar cores. We found a good agreement between the two tracers of ionized gas, with 23 common detections and only four cores detected at 3.3 cm and not in H30$\alpha$. The spectral indexes from 3.3 cm to 1.3 mm range from 1, for the youngest cores with partially optically thick free-free emission, to about -0.1, that is optically thin free-free emission obtained for cores likely more evolved. Using as a reference the H/UC HII regions, we found the statistical lifetimes of the HMC and massive protostellar phases in W49N to be about $6\times10^4$ yr and $1.4\times10^5$ yr, respectively. We also showed that HMC can co-exist with H/UC HII regions during a short fraction of the core lifetime, about $2\times10^4$ yr. This indicates a rapid dispersal of the inner molecule envelope once the HC HII is formed.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS Survey: II. the ACA 1.3 mm continuum source catalog and the assembly of dense gas in massive star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the high resolution, high sensitivity, and wide frequency coverage of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the QUARKS survey, standing for "Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures", is observing 139 massive star-forming clumps at ALMA Band 6 ($\lambda\sim$ 1.3 mm). This paper introduces the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data. Combining multi-wavelength data, we provide the first edition of QUARKS atlas, offering insights into the multiscale and multiphase interstellar medium in high-mass star formation. The ACA 1.3 mm catalog includes 207 continuum sources that are called ACA sources. Their gas kinetic temperatures are estimated using three formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) transitions with a non-LTE radiation transfer model, and the mass and density are derived from a dust emission model. The ACA sources are massive (16-84 percentile values of 6-160 $M_{\odot}$), gravity-dominated ($M\propto R^{1.1}$) fragments within massive clumps, with supersonic turbulence ($\mathcal{M}&gt;1$) and embedded star-forming protoclusters. We find a linear correlation between the masses of the fragments and the massive clumps, with a ratio of 6% between the two. When considering the fragments as representative of dense gas, the ratio indicates a dense gas fraction (DGF) of 6%, although with a wide scatter ranging from 1% to 10%. If we consider the QUARKS massive clumps to be what is observed at various scales, then the size-independent DGF indicates a self-similar fragmentation or collapsing mode in protocluster formation. With the ACA data over four orders of magnitude of luminosity-to-mass ratio ($L/M$), we find that the DGF increases significantly with $L/M$, which indicates clump evolutionary stage. We observed a limited fragmentation at the subclump scale, which can be explained by dynamic global collapse process.</description>

      <title>Licking the plate: dusty star-forming galaxies buried in the ALMA calibration data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep, unbiased surveys are essential to decipher the cosmic evolution of galaxies. The submillimetre (submm) and millimetre (mm) windows complement the UV/optical waveband and are key to revealing the cold and dusty Universe. Traditional ways of conducting deep surveys resort to either lensed fields or target small areas for ultra-long integrations. These surveys have greatly advanced our understanding of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but are susceptible to lensing uncertainties and cosmic variance and will be expensive to expand. Here, we summarise our recent multi-wavelength survey of DSFGs in the vicinity of ALMA's calibrators: the ALMACAL survey. These fields have accumulated many hundreds of hours of on-source time, reaching depths and effective areas that are competitive with bespoke cosmological surveys. We summarise the multi-wavelength number counts from ALMACAL and the resolved fraction of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) from submm to mm wavelengths. Meanwhile, combining all available ALMA observations in each field results in impressive frequency coverage, which often yields the redshifts of these DSFGs. The ALMACAL survey has demonstrated the scientific value of calibration scans for all submm/mm and radio telescopes, existing and planned.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of circumnuclear ionising clusters. III. Kinematics of gas and stars in NGC 7742</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this third paper of a series, we study the kinematics of the ionised gas and stars, calculating the dynamical masses of the circumnuclear star-forming regions in the ring of of the face-on spiral NGC 7742. We have used high spectral resolution data from the MEGARA instrument attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) to measure the kinematical components of the nebular emission lines of selected HII regions and the stellar velocity dispersions from the CaT absorption lines that allow the derivation of the associated cluster virialized masses. The emission line profiles show two different kinematical components: a narrow one with velocity dispersion $\sim$ 10 km/s and a broad one with velocity dispersion similar to those found for the stellar absorption lines. The derived star cluster dynamical masses range from 2.5 $\times$ 10$^6$ to 10.0 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of gas and stellar velocity dispersions suggests a scenario where the clusters have formed simultaneously in a first star formation episode with a fraction of the stellar evolution feedback remaining trapped in the cluster, subject to the same gravitational potential as the cluster stars. Between 0.15 and 7.07 % of the total dynamical mass of the cluster would have cooled down and formed a new, younger, population of stars, responsible for the ionisation of the gas currently observed.</description>

      <title>No top-heavy stellar initial mass function needed: the ionizing radiation of GS9422 can be powered by a mixture of AGN and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is producing high-quality rest-frame optical and UV spectra of faint galaxies at $z&gt;4$ for the first time, challenging models of galaxy and stellar populations. One galaxy recently observed at $z=5.943$, GS9422, has nebular line and UV continuum emission that appears to require a high ionizing photon production efficiency. This has been explained with an exotic stellar initial mass function (IMF), 10-30x more top-heavy than a Salpeter IMF (Cameron et al. 2023). Here we suggest an alternate explanation to this exotic IMF. We use a new flexible neural net emulator for CLOUDY, Cue, to infer the shape of the ionizing spectrum directly from the observed emission line fluxes. By describing the ionizing spectrum with a piece-wise power-law, Cue is agnostic to the source of the ionizing photons. Cue finds that the ionizing radiation from GS9422 can be approximated by a double power law characterized by $\frac{Q_\mathrm{HeII}}{Q_\mathrm{H}} = -1.5$, which can be interpreted as a combination of young, metal-poor stars and a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) with $F_{\nu} \propto \lambda ^ {2}$ in a 65%/35% ratio. This suggests a significantly lower nebular continuum contribution to the observed UV flux (24%) than a top-heavy IMF ($\gtrsim80$%), and hence, necessitates a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) to explain the continuum turnover bluewards of $\sim1400$ Angstrom. While current data cannot rule out either scenario, given the immense impact the proposed top-heavy IMF would have on models of galaxy formation, it is important to propose viable alternative explanations and to further investigate the nature of peculiar high-z nebular emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present WISE W1 photometry of the SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves) sample. The baseline of near-IR fluxes is established for use by stellar mass models, a key component to the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and other kinematic galaxies scaling relations. We focus this paper on determination of the characteristics of the W1 fluxes compared to IRAC 3.6 fluxes, internal accuracy limitations from photometric techniques, external accuracy by comparison to other work in the literature and the range of W1 to IRAC 3.6 colors. We outline the behavior of SDSS g, W1 and IRAC 3.6 colors with respect to underlying SED features. We also note a previously unknown correlation between WISE colors and the central surface brightness, probably related to the low metallicity of low surface brightness dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Size-Mass Relations for Simulated Low-Mass Galaxies: Mock Imaging versus Intrinsic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observationally-inferred size versus stellar-mass relationship for low-mass galaxies provides an important test for galaxy formation models. However, the relationship relies on assumptions that relate observed luminosity profiles to underlying stellar mass profiles. We use the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) simulations of low-mass galaxies to explore how the predicted size-mass relation (SMR) changes depending on whether one uses star-particle counts directly or mock observations. We reproduce the SMR found in the ELVES survey remarkably well only when we infer stellar masses and sizes using mock surface brightness images and the same color-inferred mass-to-light ratio (CMLR) used in deriving the observed relation. However, when we use star particles to directly infer stellar masses and half-mass radii, we find that our galaxies are too large and obey a SMR with too little scatter compared to observations. The reason for this discrepancy between the "true" galaxy size and mass and those derived in the mock observation approach is twofold. First, our simulated galaxies have higher and more varied MLRs at a fixed color than those commonly-adopted because their star-formation-histories are more temporally extended and not well represented by exponential star formation models. Using a standard CMLR therefore tends to underestimate their stellar masses compared to their true, simulated values. Second, our galaxies have radially increasing MLR gradients. Using a single MLR tends to under-predict the mass in the outer regions. Similarly, the true half-mass radius is larger than the half-light radius because the light is more concentrated than the mass. If our simulations are accurate representations of the real universe, then the relationship between galaxy size and stellar mass is even tighter for low-mass galaxies than is commonly inferred from observed relations.</description>

      <title>Radio Scrutiny of the X-ray-Weak Tail of Low-Mass Active Galactic Nuclei: A Novel Signature of High-Eddington Accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6}$$-$$10^{10}~M_\odot$) that power luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), i.e., quasars, generally show a correlation between thermal disk emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and coronal emission in hard X-rays. In contrast, some "massive" black holes (mBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}$$-$$10^{6}~M_\odot$) in low-mass galaxies present curious X-ray properties with coronal radiative output up to 100$\times$ weaker than expected. To examine this issue, we present new and archival 10 GHz Very Large Array observations of a sample of high-accretion-rate (Eddington ratios $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} &gt; 0.1$), mBH-powered AGNs with Chandra X-ray coverage. Empirical correlations previously revealed in samples of radio-quiet, high-Eddington AGNs indicate that the radio$-$X-ray luminosity ratio, $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$, is approximately constant. Through multiwavelength analysis, we instead find that the X-ray-weaker mBHs in our sample tend toward larger values of $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ even though they remain radio-quiet per their optical$-$UV properties. This trend results in a tentative but highly intriguing correlation between $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ and X-ray weakness, which we argue is consistent with a scenario in which X-rays may be preferentially obscured from our line of sight by a "slim" accretion disk. We compare this observation to weak emission-line quasars (AGNs with exceptionally weak broad-line emission and a significant X-ray-weak fraction) and conclude by suggesting that our results may offer a new observational signature for finding high-accretion-rate AGNs.</description>

      <title>A fast-rotating blue straggler star in the tidal tail of the open cluster NGC 752</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 752 is a famous Galactic open cluster of intermediate age. In recent works, a very long and asymmetric tail was newly revealed. A blue straggler star (BSS) at the periphery of the tidal tail of the cluster has been identified subsequently. We aim to perform a detailed analysis of the newly detected BSS based on the available comprehensive spectroscopic and photometric data. We also explored this BSS's possible formation pathway and age limitation based on the collected spectroscopic and photometric data. We estimated the projected rotational velocity $v\ \mathrm{sin}i$ and the mass of the BSS from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectra and multiband photometric data from various catalogs, respectively. The newly discovered BSS is confirmed as a genuine member of NGC 752. The lack of ultraviolet excess in the SED and no significant variations in the light curve imply that this BSS is likely a single star ($mass=1.86^{+3.62}_{-0.94}\ M_{\odot}$) formed through stellar mergers. The fast rotation velocity ($v\ \mathrm{sin}i=206.9\pm4.9$~km $\rm s^{-1}$) of the BSS may provide constraints on its age (less than a hundred million years), but more formation details require further investigation.</description>

      <title>Redshift-dependent galaxy formation efficiency at z=5-13 in the FirstLight simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current models of the formation of first galaxies predict low masses and faint objects at extremely high redshifts, z=9-15. However, the first observations of this epoch indicate a higher-than-expected number of bright (sometimes massive) galaxies. Numerical simulations can help to elucidate the mild evolution of the bright end of the UV luminosity function and they can provide the link between the evolution of bright galaxies and variations of the galaxy formation efficiency across different redshifts. We use the FirstLight database of 377 zoom-in cosmological simulations of a mass-complete sample of galaxies. Mock luminosities are estimated by a dust model constrained by current observations of an evolution of the beta-MUV relation at high-z. FirstLight contains a high number of bright galaxies, MUV&lt;-20, consistent with current data at z=6-13. The evolution of the UV cosmic density is driven by the evolution of the galaxy efficiency and the relation between MUV and halo mass. The efficiency of galaxy formation increases significantly with redshift at a fixed halo mass because galactic halos at extremely high redshifts convert gas into stars at a higher rate than at lower redshifts. The high gas densities in galaxies at z&gt;9 enable these high efficiencies. Our simulations predict higher number densities of massive galaxies, Ms=10^9 Msun, than other models with constant efficiency. Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with self-consistent models of star formation and feedback can reproduce the different regimes of galaxy formation across cosmic history.</description>

      <title>SpectroTranslator: a deep-neural network algorithm to homogenize spectroscopic parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large spectroscopic surveys requires homogenising on the same scale the quantities they measure in order to increase their scientific legacy. We developed the SpectroTranslator, a data-driven deep neural network algorithm that can convert spectroscopic parameters from the base of one survey to another. The algorithm also includes a method to estimate the importance that the various parameters play in the conversion from base A to B. As a showcase, we apply the algorithm to transform effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, [Mg/Fe] and los velocity from the base of GALAH into the APOGEE base. We demonstrate the efficiency of the SpectroTranslator algorithm to translate the spectroscopic parameters from one base to another using parameters directly by the survey teams, and are able to achieve a similar performance than previous works that have performed a similar type of conversion but using the full spectrum rather than the spectroscopic parameters, allowing to reduce the computational time, and to use the output of pipelines optimized for each survey. By combining the transformed GALAH catalogue with the APOGEE catalogue, we study the distribution of [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] across the Galaxy, and we find that the median distribution of both quantities present a vertical asymmetry at large radii. We attribute it to the recent perturbations generated by the passage of a dwarf galaxy across the disc or by the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Although several aspects still need to be refined, in particular how to deal in an optimal manner with regions of the parameter space meagrely populated by stars in the training sample, the SpectroTranslator already shows its capability and promises to play a crucial role in standardizing various spectroscopic surveys onto a unified basis.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field of Molecular Gas Measured with the Velocity Gradient Technique II: Curved Magnetic Field in kpc-Scale Bubble of NGC\,628</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of the ordered alignment between the magnetic field and kpc-scale bubbles in the nearby spiral galaxy, NGC\,628. Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) on CO spectroscopic data from the ALMA-PHANGS, the magnetic field of NGC\,628 is measured at the scale of 191\,pc ($\sim$ 4\,$''$). The large-scale magnetic field is oriented parallel to the spiral arms and curves around the galactic bubble structures in the mid-infrared emission observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Twenty-one bubble structures have been identified at the edges of spiral arms with scales over 300\,pc, which includes two kpc-scale structures. These bubbles are caused by supernova remnants and prolonged star formation and are similar to the outflow chimneys found in neutral hydrogen in galactic disks. At the edge of the bubbles, the shocks traced by the OIII emission present a curved magnetic field that parallels the bubble's shell. The magnetic field follows the bubble expansion and binds the gas in the shell to trigger further star formation. By analyzing the larger sample of 1694 bubbles, we found a distinct radial-size distribution of bubbles in NGC\,628 indicating the star formation history in the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive laboratory constraints on thermal desorption of interstellar ice analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explain grain growth and destruction in warm media, ice mantle formation and sublimation in cold media, and gas line emission spectroscopy, astrochemical models must mimic the gas--solid abundance ratio. Ice-sublimation mechanisms determine the position of snow lines and the nature of gas emitted by and locked inside planetary bodies in star-forming regions. To interpret observations from the interplanetary and extragalactic interstellar mediums, gas phase abundances must be modelled correctly. This study presents comprehensive thermal desorption data for interstellar ice analogues, aiming to refine astrochemical models by generating a set of benchmarks to evaluate both the kinetics and thermodynamics in astrochemical models. Our experiments focused on temperature-programmed desorption of pure and mixed ices, including Ar, CO, CO2, NH3, CH3OH, and H2O, under ultrahigh vacuum (1 x 10^-10 hPa) and low temperatures (10 K). Each experiment includes the experimental parameters, ice desorption kinetics for pure species, and the desorption yield (gas--solid ratio) for ice mixtures. From the desorption yields, we find common trends in the trapping of molecules when their abundance is compared to water: compact amorphous water ices are capable of trapping up to 20 % of volatiles (Ar, CO, and CO2), ~ 3 % of CH3OH, and ~ 5% NH3 in relation to the water content within the ice matrix; ammonium formate is not trapped in the water ice films, and compact amorphous water ice formed in situ has similar trapping capabilities to a compact amorphous water ice deposited using molecular beams. Our results highlight the limited trapping capacity of compact amorphous water ice for gases, crucial for understanding the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules.</description>

      <title>xGASS: The scatter of the HI-halo mass relation of central galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical studies of the relationship between baryonic matter in galaxies and the gravitational potential of their host halos are important to constrain our theoretical framework for galaxy formation and evolution. One such relation, between the atomic hydrogen (HI) mass of central galaxies ($M_{\rm{HI,c}}$) and the total mass of their host halos ($M_{\rm{halo}}$), has attracted significant interest in the last few years. In this work, we use the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey to examine the scatter of the HI-halo mass relation for a representative sample of central galaxies. Our findings reveal a flat median relation at $\rm{log}_{10}$$(M_{\rm{HI,c}}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) \approx 9.40$, across $11.1 &lt; \rm{log}_{10}$$(M_{\rm{halo}}/\rm{M_{\odot}}) &lt; 14.1$. This flat relation stems from the statistical dominance of star-forming, disc galaxies at low $M_{\rm{halo}}$ in combination with the increasing prevalence of passive, high stellar-concentration systems at higher $M_{\rm{halo}}$. The scatter of this relation and the stellar specific angular momentum of centrals have a strong link (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient $\geq 0.5$). Comparisons with simulations suggest that the kinematic state of host halos may be primarily driving this scatter. Our findings highlight that the HI-halo mass parameter space is too complex to be completely represented by simple median or average relations and we show that tensions with previous works are most likely due to selection biases. We recommend that future observational studies, and their comparisons with theoretical models, bin central galaxies also by their secondary properties to enable a statistically robust understanding of the processes regulating the cold gas content within central galaxies of dark-matter halos.</description>

      <title>First Light and Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XV: The physical properties of super-massive black holes and their impact on galaxies in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the co-evolution of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies remains a key challenge of extragalactic astrophysics, particularly the earliest stages at high-redshift. However, studying SMBHs at high-redshift with cosmological simulations, is challenging due to the large volumes and high-resolution required. Through its innovative simulation strategy, the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations allows us to simulate a much wider range of environments which contain SMBHs with masses extending to $M_{\bullet}&gt;10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ at $z=5$. In this paper, we use FLARES to study the physical properties of SMBHs and their hosts in the early Universe ($5\le\, z \le10$). FLARES predicts a sharply declining density with increasing redshift, decreasing by a factor of 100 over the range $z=5\to 10$. Comparison between our predicted bolometric luminosity function and pre-\emph{JWST} observations yield a good match. However, recent \emph{JWST} observations appear to suggest a larger contribution of SMBHs than previously observed, or predicted by FLARES. Finally, by using a re-simulation with AGN feedback disabled, we explore the impact of AGN feedback on their host galaxies. This reveals that AGN feedback results in a reduction of star formation activity, even at $z&gt;5$, but only in the most massive galaxies. A deeper analysis reveals that AGN are also the cause of suppressed star formation in passive galaxies but that the presence of an AGN doesn't necessarily result in the suppression of star formation.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Polarization to Grain Shape: II. Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previous study (Paper I) investigated the polarization properties of a variety of simple convex grain shapes, some of which were found to be consistent with the observed polarization properties of interstellar dust from far-ultraviolet to far-infrared. Here we study the optical properties of 45 non-convex shapes, all aggregates of $N$ equal-sized spheres. We consider $N=2$, $N=3$, and $N=256$ random aggregates obtained from 3 different aggregation schemes. We also consider "trimmed" $N=256$ aggregates obtained by systematically trimming initially random aggregates to increase either flattening or elongation. The "macroporosities" of the studied aggregates range from ${\cal P}_{\rm macro}=0.18$ (for the $N=2$ bisphere) to ${\cal P}_{\rm macro}\approx 0.85$ (for the $N=256$ "BA" aggregates). The only aggregates consistent with observations of starlight polarization and polarized thermal emission are shapes that have been trimmed to increase their asymmetry. If interstellar grains are high-porosity aggregates, there must be processes causing extreme elongation or flattening; if not, interstellar grains must be dominated by fairly compact structures, with at most moderate porosities. The ratio of polarization in the 10$\mu$m silicate feature to starlight polarization in the optical is shown to be insensitive to porosity and shape. X-ray scattering may be the best tool to determine the porosity of interstellar grains. We propose that modest porosities of interstellar grains could be the result of "photolytic densification". High polarization fractions observed in some Class-0 cores require processes to reduce porosities and/or increase asymmetries of aggregates in dense regions.</description>

      <title>Study of complex nitrogen and oxygen-bearing molecules towards the high-mass protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules gives an idea about the complex prebiotic chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this article, we present the identification of the rotational emission lines of N-bearing molecules ethyl cyanide (C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN), cyanoacetylene (HC$_{3}$N), and O-bearing molecules methyl formate (CH$_{3}$OCHO) towards high-mass protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We also detected the emission lines of both N- and O-bearing molecule formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO) in the envelope of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We have detected the $v$ = 0 and 1 states rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$OCHO. We also detected the two vibrationally excited states of HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1 and $v$7 = 2). The estimated fractional abundances of C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN, HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1), HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 2), and NH$_{2}$CHO towards the IRAS 18089$-$1732 are (1.40$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-10}$, (7.5$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^{-11}$, (3.1$\pm$0.4)$\times$10$^{-11}$, and (6.25$\pm$0.82)$\times$10$^{-11}$. Similarly, the estimated fractional abundances of CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 0) and CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 1) are (1.90$\pm$0.9)$\times$10$^{-9}$ and (8.90$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{-10}$, respectively. We also created the integrated emission maps of the detected molecules, and the observed molecules may have originated from the extended envelope of the protostar. We show that C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN and HC$_{3}$N are most probably formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of the CH$_{2}$CHCN and the reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and CN on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We found that NH$_{2}$CHO is probably produced due to the reaction between NH$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$CO in the gas phase. Similarly, CH$_{3}$OCHO is possibly created via the reaction between radical CH$_{3}$O and radical HCO on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732.</description>

      <title>Planck dust polarization power spectra are consistent with strongly supersonic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is rich in information but obscured by foreground emission from the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM). To uncover relationships between the underlying turbulent ISM and the foreground power spectra, we simulated a suite of driven, magnetized, turbulent models of the ISM, varying the fluid properties via the sonic Mach number, Ms, and magnetic (Alfv\'en) Mach number, Ma. We measure the power spectra of density ($\rho$), velocity ($v$), magnetic field ($H$), total projected intensity ($T$), parity-even polarization ($E$), and parity-odd polarization ($B$). We find that the slopes of all six quantities increase with Ms and tend to increase with Ma. By comparing spectral slopes of $E$ and $B$ to those measured by Planck, we infer typical values of Ms and Ma for the ISM. As the fluid velocity increases, the ratio of BB power to EE power increases to approach a constant value near the Planck-observed value of $\sim 0.5$ for $Ms &gt; 4$, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We also examine correlation-coefficients between projected quantities, and find that $r^{TE}\approx 0.3$, in agreement with Planck, for appropriate combinations of Ms and Ma. {Finally, we consider parity-violating correlations $r^{TB}$ and $r^{EB}$</description>

      <title>Modelling the star-formation activity and ionizing properties of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early results from the JWST observations have reported a surprisingly high number of UV-bright galaxies at $z \geq 10$, which appears to challenge the theoretical predictions from standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM framework at these redshifts. To alleviate this tension, several cosmological and astrophysical interpretations have been advanced. However, all of these proposed scenarios carry noteworthy consequences for other large-scale processes in the early Universe, particularly cosmic reionization, since high-redshift galaxies are believed to be the primary ionizing sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To investigate this, we introduce a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution that explains the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function (UVLF) over $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$, and also jointly tracks the time evolution of the globally averaged neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium. The model self-consistently accounts for the suppression of star formation in low-mass galaxies due to reionization feedback and is constrained by comparing the model predictions with various observational probes like the UVLF data from HST and JWST, recent measurements of the neutral hydrogen fraction, and the CMB scattering optical depth. Our analysis confirms that a rapid enhancement in the star-formation rate efficiency and/or UV luminosity per stellar mass formed is necessary for consistency with the JWST UVLF estimates at $z \geq 10$. We further find that it is possible to jointly satisfy the current reionization constraints when the escape fraction is assumed to be halo-mass dependent, requiring higher Lyman-continuum leakage from low-mass galaxies. We also examine the relative contribution of galaxies with different UV luminosities towards the ionizing photon budget for the EoR and investigate the large-scale bias of high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>The first CCD photometric studies of the member eclipsing binary ZTFJ015003.88+534734.1 in the newly discovered young open cluster UBC 188</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first CCD observations of an eclipsing binary, ZTFJ015003.88+534734.1, which is a member in the open star cluster UBC 188. The observations were taken by the 1.88 m telescope at the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory (KAO) in SDSS griz bands. The latest version of the Wilson- Devinney (W-D) code was employed for photometric analysis and light curve modeling of the eclipsing binary. The results indicate that the binary system is in an over-contact configuration. The mass of the primary star (M1) is determined to be 1.293 Msun, and the mass of the secondary star (M2) is directly derived from the system's estimated mass ratio (q= M2/M1) as 0.340 times the solar mass (Msun). We investigated the color-magnitude diagram and the membership probability of the open cluster UBC 188 using the Gaia DR3 data. We determined the membership probability of the eclipsing binary ZTFJ015003.88+534734.1 using the pyUPMASK algorithm and found that its membership probability is one.</description>

      <title>New Herbig-Haro Objects associated with Embedded Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to present the results of the Byurakan Narrow Band Imaging Survey (BNBIS). The main goal of this survey is to search for Herbig-Haro (HH) objects and jets in Galactic dark clouds. In this work we present the results of the search in the vicinity of infrared sources that are bright in the WISE survey and embedded in the dark clouds. The survey is performed with the 1 m Schmidt telescope of Byurakan Observatory, lately equipped with a new CCD detector, which allows to obtain one square degree images of the sky in various filters. Narrow-band filters were used to obtain Halpha and [S II] images, and a medium-width filter was used for the continuum imaging. New HH flows and knots were found near six embedded IR sources, which constitutes a significant proportion of the objects observed. At least two of the newly found HH flows (HH 1226 and HH 1227) lie in isolated dark clouds, thus pointing to active star formation in these regions. Other flows are also located in detached and dense globules or filaments. The length of the HH 1228 flow is about 1 pc; it has also a molecular hydrogen counterpart of the same extension. Coordinates, charts, detailed descriptions and distance estimates are provided. The lower limits of bolometric luminosities of the source stars are typical for low-mass young stellar objects.</description>

      <title>Beyond radial profiles: Using log-normal distributions to model the multiphase circumgalactic medium</title>

Abstract: Recent observations and simulations reveal that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies is multiphase, with the gas temperatures spanning a wide range at most radii, $\sim 10^4\ {\rm K}$ to the virial temperature ($\sim 10^6$ K for Milky Way). Traditional CGM models using simple density profiles are inadequate at reproducing observations that indicate a broad temperature range. Alternatively, a model based on probability distribution functions (PDFs) with parameters motivated by simulations can better match multi-wavelength observations. In this work, we use log-normal distributions, commonly seen in the simulations of the multiphase interstellar and circumgalactic media, to model the multiphase CGM. We generalize the isothermal background model by Faerman et al. 2017 to include more general CGM profiles. We extend the existing probabilistic models from 1D-PDFs in temperature to 2D-PDFs in density-temperature phase space and constrain its parameters using a Milky Way-like {\tt Illustris TNG50-1} halo. We generate various synthetic observables such as column densities of different ions, UV/X-ray spectra, and dispersion and emission measures. X-ray and radio (Fast Radio Burst) observations mainly constrain the hot gas properties. However, interpreting cold/warm phase diagnostics is not straightforward since these phases are patchy, with inherent variability in intercepting these clouds along arbitrary lines of sight. We provide a tabulated comparison of model predictions with observations and plan to expand this into a comprehensive compilation of models and data. Our modeling provides a simple analytic framework that is useful for describing important aspects of the multiphase CGM.</description>

      <title>Galactic magnetic fields I. Theoretical model and scaling relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic dynamo models have generally relied on input parameters that are very challenging to constrain. We address this problem by developing a model that uses observable quantities as input: the galaxy rotation curve, the surface densities of the gas, stars and star formation rate, and the gas temperature. The model can be used to estimate parameters of the random and mean components of the magnetic field, as well as the gas scale height, root-mean-square velocity and the correlation length and time of the interstellar turbulence, in terms of the observables. We use our model to derive theoretical scaling relations for the quantities of interest, finding reasonable agreement with empirical scaling relations inferred from observation. We assess the dependence of the results on different assumptions about turbulence driving, finding that agreement with observations is improved by explicitly modeling the expansion and energetics of supernova remnants. The model is flexible enough to include alternative prescriptions for the physical processes involved, and we provide links to two open-source PYTHON programs that implement it.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Very Massive Stars in extremely UV-bright star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2.2-3.6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the presence of very massive stars (VMS &gt; $100 M_{\odot}$) in the integrated spectra of 13 UV-bright star-forming galaxies at $2.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3.6$ taken with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). These galaxies have very high UV absolute magnitudes ($M_{\rm UV} \simeq -24$), intense star formation (SFR $ \simeq 100-1000$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), and metallicities in the range of 12+log(O/H) $\simeq8.10-8.50$ inferred from strong rest-optical lines. The GTC rest-UV spectra reveal spectral features indicative of very young stellar populations with VMS, such as strong P-Cygni line profiles in the wind lines N~{\sc v} $\lambda 1240$ and C~{\sc iv} $\lambda 1550$ along with intense and broad He~{\sc ii} $\lambda 1640$ emission with $EW_{0}$ $\simeq 1.40-4.60$ \AA, and FWHM $\simeq 1150-3170$ $km \ s^{-1}$. A Comparison with known VMS-dominated sources and typical galaxies without VMS reveals that some UV-bright galaxies closely resemble VMS-dominated clusters (e.g., R136 cluster). The presence of VMS is further supported by a quantitative comparison of the observed strength of the He~{\sc ii} emission with population synthesis models with and without VMS, where models with VMS are clearly preferred. Employing an empirical threshold for $EW_{0}$ (\heii) $\geq 3.0$ \AA, along with the detection of other VMS-related spectral profiles (N~{\sc iv} $\lambda 1486, 1719$), we classify nine out of 13 UV-bright galaxies as VMS-dominated sources. This high incidence of VMS-dominated sources in the UV-bright galaxy population ($\approx 70\%$) contrasts significantly with the negligible presence of VMS in typical $L_{\rm UV}^{*}$ LBGs at similar redshifts ($&lt;1\%$). Our results thus indicate that VMS are common in UV-bright galaxies, suggesting a different initial mass function (IMF) with upper mass limits between $175 M_{\odot}$ and $475 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ a Galactic Low Energy Cosmic Rays tracer</title>

Abstract: Context. Investigating the diagnostic power of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ Charge-Exchange (CE) emission as Low-Energy Galactic Cosmic Rays(LECRs) tracer in diffuse regions. Aims. In this work, we define and test a spectroscopic indicator of CE reactions between LECRs protons and neutral hydrogen atoms of the diffuse medium. This indicator can be used for mapping LECRs density in diffuse clouds and can lead to the identification of new LECRs sources as we expect density variations caused by the distance between an observed cloud and the nearest site of particle acceleration. We also lay the foundations for the definition of a photometric indicator to be used in the next full-sky photometric surveys such as the Vera Rubin 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods. Based on literature cross-sections, we calculate H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line profile ratio in the case of CE and compare it with the recombination ratio. We then test our results on the Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 and we explore how the spectroscopic constraints can turn into a photometric indicator based on colour indices. Results. We find that, in shocked environments, CE between LECRS and neutral hydrogen become the dominant process for Balmer lines emission. The hydrogen spectroscopic emission is expected to be modified, with respect to the recombination Balmer decrement,to result in double the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ with respect to a similar but quiescent region. The test on the known Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 confirm the efficiency of our spectroscopic indicator. Therefore we explore possible conversions of the spectroscopic indicator into colour indices combinations. This is the first step toward the definition and test of a photometric indicator for tracing LECRs to be applied in the LSST pipelines to photometrically identify new LECRs accelerators in the whole Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Aims. We aim to investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5, and explore its association with ambient molecular clouds (MCs). Methods. We present large-field CO (J=1-0) molecular line observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5, using the 13.7 m millimeter telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. The observations have an angular resolution of $\sim 55 ''$. We analyzed the spatial distribution of MCs in relation to the SNR shell detected in previous Urumqi $\lambda$ 6 cm radio observations and examined the CO spectra for kinematics information. Results. We find that MCs at the velocity range of [-14, -2] km s$^{-1}$ are spatially distributed along the radio shell of the SNR. Line broadening and asymmetries are observed in the CO spectra of the clouds. Moreover, we find that the molecular clouds around the shell have systematic velocity gradients in the position-velocity (PV) diagrams. Both morphology alignment and gas kinematics suggest that the SNR is associated with the ambient MCs at $\sim$ 740 pc. Based on the CO gas distance, the dimension and the age of the SNR is estimated to be 40 pc $\times$ 33 pc and 3.8 $ \times 10^4$ years, respectively. The very high energy emission of 1LHAASO J0428+5531 toward the SNR may originate from the interaction between the SNR and the surrounding MCs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of optically emitting circumgalactic nebulae around the majority of UV-luminous quasars at intermediate redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of large ionized, [O II] emitting circumgalactic nebulae around the majority of thirty UV luminous quasars at $z=0.4-1.4$ observed with deep, wide-field integral field spectroscopy (IFS) with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopy Explorer (MUSE) by the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) and MUSE Quasar Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). Among the 30 quasars, seven (23%) exhibit [O II] emitting nebulae with major axis sizes greater than 100 kpc, twenty greater than 50 kpc (67%), and 27 (90%) greater than 20 kpc. Such large, optically emitting nebulae indicate that cool, dense, and metal-enriched circumgalactic gas is common in the halos of luminous quasars at intermediate redshift. Several of the largest nebulae exhibit morphologies that suggest interaction-related origins. We detect no correlation between the sizes and cosmological dimming corrected surface brightnesses of the nebulae and quasar redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, or radio-loudness, but find a tentative correlation between the nebulae and rest-frame [O II] equivalent width in the quasar spectra. This potential trend suggests a relationship between ISM content and gas reservoirs on CGM scales. The [O II]-emitting nebulae around the $z\approx1$ quasars are smaller and less common than Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around $z\approx3$ quasars. These smaller sizes can be explained if the outer regions of the Ly$\alpha$ halos arise from scattering in more neutral gas, by evolution in the cool CGM content of quasar host halos, by lower-than-expected metallicities on $\gtrsim50$ kpc scales around $z\approx1$ quasars, or by changes in quasar episodic lifetimes between $z=3$ and $1$.</description>

      <title>Sharp departure beyond post-Newtonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{\,PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{\,PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set joint bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 irrespective of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>
