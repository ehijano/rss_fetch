      <title>Taking the Weight Off: Mitigating Parameter Bias from Catastrophic Outliers in 3$\times$2pt Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stage IV cosmological surveys will map the universe with unprecedented precision, reducing statistical uncertainties to levels where unmodelled systematics can significantly bias inference. In particular, photometric redshift (photo-z) errors and intrinsic alignments (IA) must be robustly accounted for to ensure accurate inference of cosmological parameters. The increasing depth of Stage IV surveys exacerbates these challenges by producing low signal-to-noise galaxy populations prone to inaccurate photo-z measurements. Catastrophically misidentified redshifts are especially problematic for 3$\times$2pt inferences that combine weak lensing and galaxy clustering information. We demonstrate that even modest outlier fractions (e.g. 5%) can lead to substantial biases in cosmological parameter estimates: up to 1.8${\sigma}$ in ${\Omega}_M$ and ${\sigma}_8$, and over 8${\sigma}$ in the IA redshift evolution parameter ${\eta}$. To address this, we introduce a flexible weighting scheme at the likelihood level that down-weights the most contamination-sensitive elements of the data vector during inference. This method mitigates biases without inflating the parameter space, reducing cosmological parameter biases to below 1${\sigma}$ without substantially degrading constraining power. Our approach offers a practical solution for future analyses, enabling robust cosmological inference in the presence of catastrophic redshift errors.</description>

      <title>Detecting Local and Integrated Relativistic Effects by Multi-Tracing a Single Galaxy Population in Harmonic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring relativistic effects on cosmological scales would provide further confirmation of the validity of general relativity in the still poorly tested condition of weak gravity. Despite their relevance, relativistic imprints in the distribution of galaxies on large scales have so far eluded detection, mainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, which are plagued by cosmic variance. Expanding on previous works, we study galaxy clustering by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples -- bright and faint -- and we here focus on their two-point correlation function in harmonic space, i.e. via the angular power spectrum. Thanks to such a split in magnitude and by exploiting the multi-tracer technique, we are able to boost the impact of the relativistic contributions. We first focus on the leading relativistic contribution given by the Doppler effect and show that, with a carefully tailored luminosity cut, it can be detected. Then, we look at the sub-dominant effects predicted by general relativity and quantify how their statistical significance, as yet undetectable, varies with redshift binning and survey specifications. As case studies, we consider in our forecasts a bright galaxy sample at low redshift, an H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxy survey at intermediate redshifts, and high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Fiducial-Cosmology-dependent systematics for the DESI 2024 Full-Shape Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the impact of the fiducial cosmology choice on cosmological inference from full-shape (FS) fits of the galaxy power spectrum in the DESI 2024 Data Release 1 (DR1). Using a suite of AbacusSummit DR1 mock catalogues based on the Planck 2018 best-fit cosmology, we quantify potential systematic shifts introduced by analysing the data under five secondary cosmologies - featuring variations in matter density, thawing dark energy, higher effective number of neutrino species, reduced clustering amplitude, and the DESI DR1 BAO best-fit $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology - relative to DESI's baseline Planck 2018 cosmology. We investigate two complementary FS analysis approaches: full-modelling (FM) and ShapeFit (SF), each with distinct sensitivities to the assumed fiducial model. Across all tracers, we find for FM that systematic shifts induced by fiducial cosmology mismatches remain well below the DESI DR1 statistical uncertainties, with maximum deviations of 0.22$\sigma_\mathrm{DR1}$ in $\Lambda$CDM scenarios and 0.12$\sigma_\mathrm{DR1+SN}$ when including SN Ia mock data in extended $w_0w_a$CDM fits. For SF, the shifts in the compressed parameters remain below $0.45\sigma_\mathrm{DR1}$ for all tracers and cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a $z \sim 0.8$ Ultra Steep Spectrum Radio Halo in the MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio halos are diffuse synchrotron sources that trace the turbulent intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. However, their origin remains unknown. Two main formation models have been proposed: the hadronic model, in which relativistic electrons are continuously injected by cosmic-ray protons; and the leptonic turbulent re-acceleration model, where cluster mergers re-energise electrons in situ. A key discriminant between the two models would be the existence of ultra-steep spectrum radio halos (USSRHs), which can only be produced through turbulent re-acceleration. Here we report the discovery of an USSRH in the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2337$-$5942 at redshift $z = 0.78$ in the MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope 100 deg$^2$ survey. This discovery is noteworthy for two primary reasons: it is the highest redshift USSRH system to date; and the close correspondence of the radio emission with the thermal ICM as traced by $\mathit{Chandra}$ X-ray observations, further supporting the leptonic re-acceleration model. The halo is under-luminous for its mass, consistent with a minor merger origin, which produces steep-spectrum, lower luminosity halos. This result demonstrates the power of wide-field, high-fidelity, $\lesssim1$ GHz surveys like the MeerKAT-SPT 100 deg$^2$ programme to probe the origin and evolution of radio halos over cosmic time, ahead of the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moon is our future. It may seem like a chimera with a projected cost in excess of 100 billion\$, and counting, dispensed on ARTEMIS with little to show to date. However it is the ideal site for the largest telescopes that we can dream about, at wavelengths spanning decimetric radio through optical to terahertz FIR. And it is these future telescopes that will penetrate the fundamental mysteries of the first hydrogen clouds, the first stars, the first galaxies, the first supermassive black holes, and the nearest habitable exoplanets. Nor does it stop there. Our lunar telescopes will take us back to the first months of the Universe, and even back to the first 10$^{-36}$ second after the Big Bang when inflation most likely occurred. Our lunar telescopes will provide high resolution images of exoplanets that are nearby Earth-like 'twins' and provide an unrivalled attempt to answer the ultimate cosmic question of whether we are alone in the universe. Here I will set out my vision of the case for lunar astronomy over the next several decades.</description>

      <title>Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: Fundamental Physics and Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.</description>

      <title>Constraints from the Giant Arc in Abell 370. A New Framework for Understanding Systematic Errors in Cluster Lens Modeling. IV. Constraints from the Giant Arc in Abell 370</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to improve cluster lens modeling and source reconstruction by utilizing the full information in giant, caustic-crossing arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. Lens models are generally constrained using image positions and assuming point sources, but spatially extended giant arcs provide more constraints; however, they require a more complex model that accounts for the structure of the extended source. We seek to determine whether improvements to the lens model and reconstructed source merit the difficulty of handling the extra constraints. We choose the spatially extended $z=0.725$ giant arc in the $z=0.375$ Abell 370 galaxy cluster field for our study. We present 1) a series of pixel-based source reconstructions for cluster mass models exploring the range of uncertainties in our fiducial model, 2) a similar analysis done using a prototype \textit{python} de-lensing code for cluster mass models from each of the Hubble Frontier Fields modeling teams, 3) an optimized model with pixel-based source reconstructions, and 4) and an investigation of how our optimized model affects the cluster mass model locally and globally in the highest-magnification regions. We find that our optimized model 1) is able to correct resolution-limited assumptions in cluster model inputs local to the arc, 2) has significantly smaller arc model residuals than results from the standard Hubble Frontier Fields models, and 3) affects the critical curves and therefore the information derived from highest-magnification zones most significantly in regions local to the arc.</description>

      <title>Matter power spectrum reconstruction with KiDS-Legacy: Improved internal $\Lambda$CDM consistency and preference for strong baryonic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct measurements of the matter power spectrum, $P_\mathrm{m}(k,z)$, provide a powerful tool to investigate observed tensions between models of structure growth while also testing the internal consistency of cosmological probes. We analyse cosmic shear data from the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), presenting a deprojected $P_\mathrm{m}(k,z)$, measured in up to three redshift bins. Compared to analyses using previous KiDS releases, we find improved internal consistency in the $z\lesssim0.7$ regime. At large scales, $k\lesssim0.1\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, our power spectrum reconstruction aligns with $\Lambda$CDM predictions with a density fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8=0.81$. Furthermore, at small scales, $k=3$-$20\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the average matter power spectrum is suppressed by $30\%\pm10\%\,{\rm (stat.)}\pm4\%\,{\rm (sys.)}$ with $2.8\sigma$ significance relative to a dark-matter-only model, consistent with expectations of strong baryonic feedback.</description>

      <title>An improved model for the effect of correlated Si-III absorption on the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of Si-III absorption and its effect on the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the Sherwood-Relics hydrodynamical simulation suite. In addition to the well-understood oscillations arising from the Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross correlation, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si-III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\leq z \leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k &lt; 0.2\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$. Our model remains in good agreement with earlier work at large scales ($k \lesssim 0.06\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$) and it has little effect on existing warm dark matter constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest when adopting a physically motivated prior on the silicon abundance. It will, however, be an essential consideration for future, high-precision Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>Implications of SPT and eROSITA cosmologies for Planck cluster number counts and t-SZ power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparison between cosmological studies is usually performed in a statistical manner at the level of the posteriors of cosmological parameters. In this Letter, we show how this approach poorly reflects the differences between cosmological analyses, when applied to cosmological studies using galaxy cluster abundances. We illustrate this by deriving the implications of the best-fit cosmologies from the recent SPT and eROSITA cluster number counts analyses on the Planck thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (t-SZ) probes. We first fix the mass calibration, and find that the Planck cluster sample would theoretically contain 498 clusters with the SPT cosmology, and 1098 clusters with the eROSITA cosmology, instead of the 439 clusters observed. We then fit the Planck number counts to both cosmologies, only varying the hydrostatic mass bias, and find required biases of $0.790 \pm 0.070$ and $0.630 \pm 0.034$ for SPT and eROSITA respectively, instead of the $0.844^{+0.055}_{-0.062}$ derived in Aymerich et al. (2025). Lastly, we compute the expected t-SZ power spectrum obtained from the SPT and eROSITA cosmologies, and compare these to the Planck measurement. While the predicted SPT angular power spectrum is in good agreement with the Planck measurements, the normalisation of the predicted eROSITA angular power spectrum is two times higher at all scales. These two tests highlight the power of comparing predicted cluster abundances and t-SZ power spectra to measured data in a physically interpretable way.</description>

      <title>Parity Violation in Galaxy Shapes: Primordial Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) as a probe of parity-violating primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we show that the parity-odd IA power spectrum is sensitive to the collapsed limit of the parity-odd primordial trispectrum. For a $U(1)$-gauge inflationary model, the IA power spectrum is proportional to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation, $P_\zeta(k) \propto k^{-3}$. However, the proportionality constants contain not only the PNG amplitude but also undetermined EFT bias parameters. We use $N$-body simulations to determine the bias parameters for dark matter halos. Using these bias parameters, we forecast IA's constraining power, assuming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that the IA power spectrum can improve the current limits on the amplitude of parity-violating PNG derived from galaxy four-point correlation and CMB trispectrum analyses. Moreover, galaxy shapes are complementary to these probes as they are sensitive to different scales and trispectrum configurations. Beyond galaxy shapes, we develop a new method to generate initial conditions for simulations and forward models from the parity-odd trispectrum with an enhanced collapsed limit.</description>

      <title>Cosmology, Decoherence and the Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum decoherence and entropy increase in early universe cosmology. We first study decoherence in a discrete bipartite quantum system for which a single qubit gets entangled with an environment and the entropy increase is correlated with the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix. We compare this system with continuous systems relevant for cosmology for which there is a natural external intervention, corresponding to the time-dependent separation between the sub- and super-horizon inflationary fluctuations. We find, in this case, that the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, in a field basis, do not decay as sometimes assumed in cosmological set-ups. Nevertheless, following a recent treatment in terms of open Effective Field Theories (EFTs), we compute the entanglement entropy for a Gaussian state and show that it actually increases monotonically ($\dot S&gt;0$) during the accelerated phases ($\ddot a&gt;0$ with $a(t)$ the scale factor). We generalise this result to include non-Gaussian states and briefly discuss the relevance of computing the von Neumann entropy as compared to the thermodynamic entropy.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the redshift and group richness dependence of the quiescent fraction and red-sequence (RS) parameters in COSMOS galaxy groups from z=0 to z=3.7. We analyzed the deep and well-characterized sample of groups detected with AMICO in the COSMOS(-Web) field. Our study of the quiescent galaxy population is based on a machine-learning classification tool based on rest-frame magnitudes. The algorithm learns from several traditional methods to estimate the probability of a galaxy being quiescent, achieving high precision and recall. Starting from this classification, we computed quiescent galaxy fractions within groups via two methods: one based on the membership probabilities provided by AMICO, which rely on an analytical model, and another using a model-independent technique. We then detected the RS by estimating the ridgeline position using photometric data, followed by sigma clipping to remove outliers. This analysis was performed using both rest-frame and observed-frame magnitudes with rest-frame matching. We compared the results from both approaches and investigated the $z$ and richness dependence of the RS parameters. We found that the quiescent galaxy population in groups builds up steadily from z=1.5-2 across all richnesses, with faster and earlier growth in the richest groups. The first galaxies settle onto the RS ridgeline by $z \sim 2$, consistent with current evolutionary scenarios. Notably, we reported a rare overdensity of quiescent galaxies at z=3.4, potentially one of the most distant early RSs observed. Extending our study to X-rays, we found that X-ray faint groups have, on average, lower quiescent fractions than X-ray bright ones, likely reflecting their typical location in filaments. Leveraging the broad wavelength coverage of COSMOS2025, we traced RS evolution over $\sim 12$ Gyr, finding no significant trends in either slope or scatter of the ridgeline.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the supermassive black hole abundance and implications for the GW background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present-day mass function of supermassive black holes is the most important observable quantity for the prediction and theoretical interpretation of the gravitational wave background (GWB) measured by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Due to the limited sample size of galaxies with dynamically inferred SMBH masses, more readily measurable galaxy properties $X$ that correlate with the black hole mass are used as labels (via scaling relations $M_{\bullet}-X$), which can then be counted in a larger galaxy catalog to produce a measurement of the mass function. Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass function is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations and galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the characteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass proxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both catalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce significant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance. In this work, we explore measurements of the SMBH mass function using different mass proxies through a set of catalogs with a number of redundant measurements between them. This enables us to investigate internal inconsistencies that lead to discrepancies in the final black hole abundance, while minimizing observational systematic biases induced by combining disparate sets of measurements. We focus on 3 proxies: the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, K-band luminosity $L$, and a combination of $L$ and radius $R$ defined by the fundamental plane. We show that all three can be reconciled to some degree, but highlight the remaining dependence on poorly-quantified systematic corrections between the scaling relation catalogs and the mass function catalogs, as well as the potential impact of selection effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the status of benchmark simplified dark matter models that have been proposed to explain the GeV gamma-ray Galactic Center excess. We constrain the available parameter space using updated observations from indirect detection, cosmology, direct detection, and accelerators. We show that there is still unconstrained parameter space in both classes of models we consider (a secluded dark sector with a vector portal coupling, and a two-Higgs doublet with a pseudoscalar mediator), and discuss the prospects for potential improvement of these constraints in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Affleck-Dine Leptoflavorgenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario to produce large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with vanishing total lepton asymmetry, based on the Affleck-Dine mechanism with Q-ball formation. This scenario can produce large lepton flavor asymmetries while automatically maintaining the vanishing total lepton number without fine-tuning, evading the current BBN and the CMB constraints by neutrino oscillations at MeV temperature. The asymmetries can be produced at cosmic temperatures of $T\gtrsim 1\ {\rm GeV}$, early enough to have broad impacts from the early Universe to the present cosmology. This scenario could affect various aspects of early Universe cosmology simultaneously or separately: (i) explaining the observed baryon asymmetry by the same origin as the lepton flavor asymmetries, (ii) affecting the nature of the QCD transition, (iii) opening up a new parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter by enhancing their production, and (iv) altering the abundance of the light elements, in particular, resolving the recently reported helium-4 anomaly.</description>

      <title>New test of modified gravity with gravitational wave experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new strategy to probe non-tensorial polarizations in the stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. Averaging over polarization angles, we find that three-point correlations of the GW signal vanish for tensor and vector modes, while scalar modes generically leave a nonzero imprint. This property makes the GW bispectrum a distinctive and robust diagnostic of scalar polarizations predicted in theories beyond General Relativity. We derive the corresponding response functions for ground-based interferometers, pulsar timing arrays, and astrometric observables, and we construct an optimal estimator together with simple Fisher forecasts for pulsar-timing sensitivity. As a proof of principle, we show that second-order GWs sourced by primordial magnetogenesis can be characterized by large three-point functions. Our results demonstrate that GW three-point correlations provide a novel observational window on physics beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Search for a photon peak from keV-scale dark matter annihilation with NuSTAR: Constraints on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ after 11 years of observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new constraints on the velocity-independent annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ of keV-scale dark matter particles based on 11 years of observations with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.</description>

      <title>Frequent Extreme Galaxy-scale Outflows among Luminous Early Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of abundant post-starburst/quiescent galaxies just $\sim$1-2 Gyrs after the Big Bang challenges our current paradigm of galaxy evolution. Cosmological simulations suggest that quasar feedback is likely the most promising mechanism responsible for such rapid quenching. Here we report a high detection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows traced by [O III] emission in z $\sim$ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to $\sim$8400 km s$^{-1}$ and order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to $\sim$260% the observed quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is $\gtrsim$6.6 times larger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z $\sim$ 1.5-3.5 (0/58) and z $&lt;$ 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z $\lesssim$ 3, and could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium (IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is $\sim$230$\times$ higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds through the synergy of LISA and ET</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) interferometers LISA and ET are expected to be functional in the next decade(s), possibly around the same time. They will operate over different frequency ranges, with similar integrated sensitivities to the amplitude of a stochastic GW background (SGWB). We investigate the synergies between these two detectors, in terms of a multi-band detection of a cosmological SGWB characterised by a large amplitude, and a broad frequency spectrum. We develop the notion of integrated sensitivity and propose a novel signal-to-noise (SNR) optimal for characterization of the geometrical properties of the interferometer systems of LISA and ET operating simultaneously. By investigating various examples of SGWBs, such as those arising from cosmological phase transition, cosmic string, primordial inflation, we show that LISA and ET operating together will have the opportunity to assess more effectively the characteristics of the GW spectrum produced by the same cosmological source, but at separate frequency scales. Moreover, the two experiments in tandem can be sensitive to features of early universe cosmic expansion before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which affects the SGWB frequency profile, and which would not be possible to detect otherwise, since two different frequency ranges correspond to two different pre-BBN (or post-inflationary) epochs. Besides considering the GW spectrum, we additionally undertake a preliminary study of the sensitivity of LISA and ET to soft limits of higher order tensor correlation functions. Given that these experiments operate at different frequency bands, their synergy constitutes an ideal direct probe of squeezed limits of higher order GW correlators, which can not be measured operating with a single instrument only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very little is known about the cosmological history from after the end of inflation until Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Various well-motivated models predict that the universe could have undergone a period of matter domination in this early epoch. We demonstrate that if the particles causing matter domination have self-interactions, they can form halos that undergo a gravothermal collapse. We thus propose a novel scenario for the formation of primordial black holes, which in particular can lie within the asteroid-mass range. We also find that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of a gravothermal evolution. We show that number-changing annihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt the gravothermal evolution, thus forming a ``cannibal star''. Likewise, the pressure from the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during a gravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation in the early universe can have a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of the one-dimensional power spectrum of 21-cm forest based on a halo model method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest, composed of spectral absorption features from high-redshift background radio sources, provides a unique probe for studying small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization. It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we explore the potential for Neutron Stars (NSs) at the Galactic center and Population~III stars to constrain bosonic Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM). We demonstrate that for NSs in an environment of sufficiently high DM density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim10^{9}\text{GeV/cm}^3$), the effects of both multiscatter capture and DM evaporation cannot be neglected. Conversely, for Pop~III stars, we find they are excellent at probing low-mass ADM. For instance, the most easily observable Population III stars could be highly effective at constraining high-$\sigma$ low-$m_\chi$ DM, maintaining efficacy below $m_\chi=10^{-15}\text{GeV}$ (assuming a Bose Einstein Condensate(BEC) forms) thanks to their far lower value of $m_\chi$ at which capture saturates to the geometric limit. Finally, we derive closed-form approximations for the evaporation rate of DM from arbitrary polytropic objects and from DM particles in a BEC state.</description>

      <title>Influence of photometric galaxies redshift distribution in BAO estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric surveys are good solutions for large-scale structure studies. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) benefit from photometric redshift survey observations due to faster coverage and a higher number of observed objects. In the present study, we use the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to incorporate the realistic galaxies' redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF) into the correlation function cosmological model. We used four different photo-z estimators \texttt{ANNz2}, \texttt{BPZ}, \texttt{ENF}, and \texttt{DNF} to compare how they affect the BAO feature constraint, the catalogs called \texttt{Pz Cats}. Moreover, each algorithm included two sample selections based on distinct PDF shapes; one where the PDFs are nearly Gaussian and another opting for the least noisy PDFs with a pronounced peak. Our investigation identifies whether our samples detect BAO using the correlation function's polynomial parameterization. Later, we computed the correlation function $\xi_\perp(z_p)$ by getting the bin pairs transversal to each other using \texttt{CAMB}. The kernel window function is the $f(z|z_p)$ which is the selection of the PDF value when the photometric redshift is nearly the same as the spectroscopic redshift estimated by the matched spectroscopic sample. For compatible $z_{\rm eff}$, we concluded that the shape of the galaxy redshift PDF could shift the BAO feature position either by including the PDF in the model or not. We also learnt that, given the same spectroscopic sample, \texttt{ANNz2} estimator with its respective selection samples outperforms other estimators for most parameters examined.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\nu&lt; 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu &lt; 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>Tidal Suppression of Fuzzy Dark Matter Heating in Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many previous studies have imposed stringent constraints on the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by analyzing observations of Galactic satellite galaxies, which show no significant evidence of the heating effect predicted by FDM. However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating effect in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: Forecasting constraints on Neutrino Masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale structure survey J-PAS is taking data since October 2023. In this work, we present a forecast based on the Fisher matrix method to establish its sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses. We adapt the Fisher Galaxy Survey Code (FARO) to account for the neutrino mass under various configurations applied to galaxy clustering measurements. This approach allows us to test the sensitivity of J-PAS to the neutrino mass across different tracers, with and without non-linear corrections, and under varying sky coverage. We perform our forecast for two cosmological models: $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ and $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$. We combine our J-PAS forecast with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration and Type Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon Plus. Our analysis shows that, for a sky coverage of 8,500 square degrees, J-PAS galaxy clustering data alone will constrain the sum of the neutrino masses to an upper limit at 95\% C.L of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.32$ eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.36$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. When combined with Planck data, the upper limit improves significantly. For J-PAS+Planck at 95\% C.L, we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.061$ eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and for J-PAS+Planck+Pantheon Plus, we obtain $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.12$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. These results demonstrate that J-PAS clustering measurements can play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the neutrino sector, including potential tensions between cosmological and terrestrial measurements of the neutrino mass, as well as in determining the mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Mixed Dark Matter and Galaxy Clustering: The Importance of Relative Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a perturbative model to describe large-scale structure in cosmologies where dark matter consists of a mixture of cold (CDM) and warm (WDM) components. In such mixed dark matter (MDM) scenarios, even a subdominant warm component can introduce distinctive signatures via its free-streaming effects, altering the evolution of density and velocity perturbations. We present linear-order solutions for both total and relative perturbations in the two-fluid system, identifying novel contributions to galaxy bias caused by the relative density and velocity modes between the components. Incorporating these effects into the galaxy bias expansion, we compute the linear galaxy power spectrum in both real and redshift space. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming surveys such as DESI and PFS to MDM scenarios. Our results demonstrate that neglecting relative perturbations can lead to significant biases in inferred constraints on the warm dark matter fraction, particularly for lighter WDM masses ($\lesssim 150~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\lesssim 80~\mathrm{eV}$) for PFS and DESI, respectively. This framework provides a consistent and generalizable approach for incorporating multi-component dark matter dynamics into galaxy clustering analyses.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: improved mitigation of spatially varying observational systematics with masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As photometric surveys reach unprecedented statistical precision, systematic uncertainties increasingly dominate large-scale structure probes relying on galaxy number density. Defining the final survey footprint is critical, as it excludes regions affected by artefacts or suboptimal observing conditions. For galaxy clustering, spatially varying observational systematics, such as seeing, are a leading source of bias. Template maps of contaminants are used to derive spatially dependent corrections, but extreme values may fall outside the applicability range of mitigation methods, compromising correction reliability. The complexity and accuracy of systematics modelling depend on footprint conservativeness, with aggressive masking enabling simpler, robust mitigation. We present a unified approach to define the DES Year 6 joint footprint, integrating observational systematics templates and artefact indicators that degrade mitigation performance. This removes extreme values from an initial seed footprint, leading to the final joint footprint. By evaluating the DES Year 6 lens sample MagLim++ plus plus on this footprint, we enhance the Iterative Systematics Decontamination (ISD) method, detecting non-linear systematic contamination and improving correction accuracy. While the mask's impact on clustering is less significant than systematics decontamination, it remains non-negligible, comparable to statistical uncertainties in certain w(theta) scales and redshift bins. Supporting coherent analyses of galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, the final footprint spans 4031.04 deg2, setting the basis for DES Year 6 1x2pt, 2x2pt, and 3x2pt analyses. This work highlights how targeted masking strategies optimise the balance between statistical power and systematic control in Stage-III and -IV surveys.</description>

      <title>SMEFT effects on gravitational wave spectrum from electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observations are potentially sensitive to new physics corrections to the Higgs potential once the first-order electroweak phase transition arises. We study the SMEFT dimension-six operator effects on the Higgs potential, where three types of effects are taken into account: (i) SMEFT tree level effect on $\varphi^6$ operator, (ii) SMEFT tree level effect on the wave function renormalization of the Higgs field, and (iii) SMEFT top-quark one-loop level effect. The sensitivity of future gravitational wave observations to these effects is numerically calculated by performing a Fisher matrix analysis. We find that the future gravitational wave observations can be sensitive to (ii) and (iii) once the first-order electroweak phase transition arises from (i). The dimension-eight $\varphi^8$ operator effects on the first-order electroweak phase transition are also discussed. The sensitivities of the future gravitational wave observations are also compared with those of future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Warm and Fuzzy Dark Matter: Free Streaming of Wave Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave or fuzzy dark matter that is produced with relativistic wavenumbers exhibits free streaming effects analogous to warm or hot particle dark matter with relativistic momenta. Axions produced after inflation provide such a warm or mildly relativistic candidate, where the enhanced suppression and observational bounds are only moderately stronger than that from wave propagation of initially cold axions. More generally, the free streaming damping also impacts isocurvature fluctuations from generation in causally disconnected patches. As coherent spatial fluctuations free stream away they leave incoherent and transient superpositions in their wakes. These multiple wave momentum streams are the wave analogue of particle phase space fluctuations or directional collisionless damping of massive neutrinos or hot dark matter. The observable impact on both adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations of fuzzy dark matter can differ from their cold dark matter counterparts due to free streaming depending on how warm or hot is their momentum distribution.</description>

      <title>A theoretical investigation of far-infrared fine structure lines at $z&gt;6$ and of the origin of the [OIII]88/[CII]158 enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] The [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift $z &gt; 6$ show peculiarly higher [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$ and [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\mu m}$ and [NIII]$_{57\mu m}$ emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution ($m_{\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\, M_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift $z = 6.5$, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios that are a factor of $\sim 5$ higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$-SFR and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios observed at $z &gt; 6$. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent $z &gt; 6$ JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ ratio of $1.3$, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.</description>

      <title>Dark plasmas in the nonlinear regime: constraints from particle-in-cell simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the dark sector possesses long-range self-interactions, these interactions can source dramatic collective instabilities even in astrophysical settings where the collisional mean free path is long. Here, we focus on the specific case of dark matter halos composed of a dark $U(1)$ gauge sector undergoing a dissociative cluster merger. We study this by performing the first dedicated particle-in-cell plasma simulations of interacting dark matter streams, tracking the growth, formation, and saturation of instabilities through both the linear and nonlinear regimes. We find that these instabilities give rise to local (dark) electromagnetic inhomogeneities that serve as scattering sites, inducing an effective dynamic collisional cross-section. Mapping this effective cross-section onto existing results from large-scale simulations of the Bullet Cluster, we extend the limit on the dark charge-to-mass ratio by over ten orders of magnitude. Our results serve as a simple example of the rich phenomenology that may arise in a dark sector with long-range interactions and motivate future dedicated study of such ``dark plasmas.''</description>

      <title>QZO: A Catalog of 5 Million Quasars from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are well established in the classification of quasars (QSOs). However, the advent of light curve observations adds a great amount of complexity to the problem. Our goal is to use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to create a catalog of QSOs. We process the ZTF DR20 light curves with a transformer artificial neural network and combine different surveys with extreme gradient boosting. Based on ZTF g-band and WISE observations, we find 4,849,574 objects classified as QSOs with confidence higher than 90%. We robustly classify objects fainter than the $5\sigma$ SNR limit at $g=20.8$ by requiring $g &lt; n_\mathrm{obs} / 80 + 20.375$. For 33% of QZO objects, with available WISE data, we publish redshifts with estimated error $\Delta z/(1 + z) = 0.14$. We find that ZTF classification is superior to the Pan-STARRS static bands, and on par with WISE and Gaia measurements, but the light curves provide the most important features for QSO classification in the ZTF dataset. Using ZTF g-band data with at least 100 observational epochs per light curve, we obtain 97% F1 score for QSOs. We find that with 3 day median cadence, a survey time span of at least 900 days is required to achieve 90% QSO F1 score. However, one can obtain the same score with a survey time span of 1800 days and the median cadence prolonged to 12 days.</description>

Abstract: We establish an exact correspondence between tree-level cosmological correlators with unparticle exchange (at integer scaling dimensions) and banana diagrams of conformally coupled scalars. This duality enables us to systematically solve the governing differential equations through the application of shift relations and de Sitter bootstrap techniques. Furthermore, we adapt a dimensional regularization scheme to cosmological correlators, demonstrating how renormalization conditions uniquely fix the regularization prescription. Our results provide new insights into the analytic structure of higher-order loop corrections to inflationary correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and Implications for Fundamental Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95\% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. By way of motivation, we also compare this to a weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

Abstract: We study the purely gravitational signatures of dark matter from the ultralight to the ultraheavy mass range in proposed long-baseline atom gradiometers, focusing on terrestrial designs, such as AION-km and MAGIS-km, as well as space-based concepts, such as MAGIS-space, AEDGE and AEDGE+. Due to its exceptional acceleration sensitivity and depending on astrophysical backgrounds, a detector similar to AEDGE+ could detect a dark matter subcomponent which constitutes $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the local dark matter energy density and is populated by compact clumps of mass between $10^6$~kg and $10^{10}$~kg ($10^{-25}~M_\odot\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{-21}~M_\odot$) in an otherwise unexplored region of dark matter model space. Furthermore, because the gravitational observable depends on the relative gravitational time delay measured by spatially separated atomic clouds, we find that atom gradiometers are parametrically more sensitive than laser interferometers, such as LIGO and LISA, to fast-oscillating spacetime perturbations sourced by energy density and pressure fluctuations of ultralight dark matter. Depending on astrophysical backgrounds, a detector akin to AEDGE+ could probe a DM overdensity of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ times the local dark matter energy density for masses $m\lesssim 10^{-17}$~eV.</description>

      <title>Constraining the environment of compact binary mergers with self-lensing signatures</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by objects in the same gravitational system (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\rm GW}\sim (1-10^3)\,{\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low, $\tau\simeq10^{-7}$, even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions, $\tau\simeq 10^{-5}$. Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\tau\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH, or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, $\tau \simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are multiple images that are already detectable. Moreover, self-lensed signals from AGN disks have a distinct linear polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for feature selection and classification of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18854</link>

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, exhibiting a wide range of physical and observational properties. Distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs remains a key challenge in understanding their nature. In this work, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs based on both primary observables from the CHIME catalog and physically motivated derived features. We evaluate three hybrid pipelines combining dimensionality reduction with clustering: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + k-means, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) + Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN), and t-SNE + Spectral Clustering. To identify optimal hyperparameters, we implement a comprehensive grid search using a custom scoring function that prioritizes recall while penalizing excessive cluster fragmentation and noise. Feature relevance is assessed using principal component loadings, mutual information with the known repeater label, and permutation-based F\textsubscript{2} score sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the derived features, including redshift, luminosity, and spectral properties, such as the spectral index and the spectral running, significantly enhance the classification performance. Finally, we identify a set of FRBs currently labeled as non-repeaters that consistently cluster with known repeaters across all methods, highlighting promising candidates for future follow-up observations and reinforcing the utility of unsupervised approaches in FRB population studies.</description>

      <title>A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH's wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{infall} \gtrsim 0.01 - 0.1 M_\odot yr^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \sim 20 - 10$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q \sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH-DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining select high-$z$ sources such as the Little Red Dots (LRDs), and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin-bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Analytic Renormalisation of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loop contributions to cosmological correlators and to the associated wavefunction are of key theoretical and phenomenological interest. Here, we investigate and compare different renormalisation schemes proposed in the literature to handle ultraviolet divergences and develop new schemes adapting $\eta$ regulators to de Sitter spacetime. We focus on one-loop contributions to the quadratic wavefunction coefficient of a shift-symmetric massless scalar in de Sitter spacetime, which is a good toy model of primordial curvature perturbations. We show that different implementations of dimensional regularisation agree with each other and with unitarity and scale invariance in the final renormalised result. Imposing unitarity in the form of the cosmological optical theorem, we define a class of unitary and analytic $\eta$ regulators that agree with dim reg but feature considerable technical and conceptual simplifications. We show that the imaginary part of all one-loop wavefunction coefficients is universally fixed in terms of the logarithmic running of the real part, under the assumptions of scale invariance, Bunch-Davies vacuum and light bulk fields. Our work resolves discrepancies in the literature, establishes regulator-independent predictions for the imaginary part at one loop, and provides a practical framework for computing quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.</description>
