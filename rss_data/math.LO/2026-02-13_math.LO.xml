      <title>Categoricity and non-arithmetic Fuchsian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma \subset PSL_2(\mathbb{R})$ be a non-arithmetic Fuchsian group of the first kind with finite covolume, and let $j_{\Gamma}$ be a corresponding uniformizer. In this paper we introduce a natural $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$-axiomatization $T^{\infty}_{SF}$ of the theory of $j_{\Gamma}$ viewed as a covering map. We show that $T^{\infty}_{SF}$ is categorical in all infinite cardinalities, extending to the non-arithmetic setting earlier results of Daw and Harris obtained in the arithmetic case. We also show that the associated first-order theory $T_{j_{\Gamma}}$ is complete, admits elimination of quantifiers, and is $\omega$-stable.</description>

      <title>PBNF-transform as a formulation of Propositional Calculus, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show, in the second paper in a series of articles, methods to calculate propositional statements with algebraic polyno mials as symbols for the connectives, which here are named operators. In the first article, we explained this formulation of the Propositional Calculus. In short, we transform to a dual space, which we here refer to as a polynomial family, which is another shape of DBNF. We name the polynomial families as PBNF, which stands for Polynomial Boolean Normal Form. We just use the one law of inference, the rule of Substi tution. We can use different polynomial families in the House of PBNF, depending on the statement form, making it even simpler. It is also pos sible to find new theorems and generalize older ones, for example, those given by Church and Barkley Rosser (see follow-up article) concerning duality.</description>

      <title>Largeness notions and polytime translation for $\forall \Sigma^0_3$-consequences of $\mathsf{RT}^2_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Le Hou\'erou, Patey and Yokoyama defined a parameterized version of $\alpha$-largeness to prove that $\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \mathsf{RT}^2_2$ is a $\forall \Sigma^0_3$-conservative extension of $\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0_2$, where $\forall \Sigma^0_3$ is the universal set-closure of the class of $\Sigma^0_3$-formulas. We introduce a variant of this notion of largeness and obtain polynomial bounds, using a tree partition theorem based on Milliken's tree theorem. Thanks to the framework of forcing interpretation, this yields that any proof of a $\forall \Sigma^0_3$-sentence in the theory $\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \mathsf{RT}^2_2$ can be translated into a proof in $\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0_2$ at the cost of a polynomial increase in size.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's Program and Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary aim of Hilbert's proof theory was to establish the consistency of classical mathematics using finitary means only. Hilbert's strategy for doing this was to eliminate the infinite (in the form of unbounded quantifiers) from formalized proofs using the so-called epsilon substitution method. The result is a formal proof which does not mention or appeal to infinite objects or "concept-formations." However, as later developments showed, the consistency proof itself lets the infinite back into proof theory, through a back door, so to speak. The paper outlines the epsilon substitution method as an example of how proof-theoretic constructions "eliminate the infinite" from formal proofs, and how they aim to establish conservativity and consistency. The proof also requires an argument that this proof theoretic construction always works. This second argument, however, requires possibly infinitary reasoning at the meta-level, using induction on ordinal notations.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Abstract Cyclic Proofs into Proofs by Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic proof theory breaks tradition by allowing certain infinite proofs: those that can be represented by a finite graph, while satisfying a soundness condition. We reconcile cyclic proofs with traditional finite proofs: we extend abstract cyclic proof systems with a well-founded induction principle, and transform any cyclic proof into a finite proof in the extended system. Moreover, this transformation preserves the structure of the cyclic proof.
  Our results leverage an annotated representation of cyclic proofs, which allows us to extract induction hypotheses and to determine their introduction order. The representation is essentially a reset proof with one key modification: names must be covered in a uniform way before a reset. This innovation allows us to handle cyclic proofs where the underlying inductive sort is non-linear.
  Our framework is general enough to cover recursive functions satisfying the size-change termination principle, which are viewed as cyclic proofs under the Curry-Howard correspondence.</description>

      <title>Verified Program Extraction in Number Theory: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and Relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article revisits standard theorems from elementary number theory from a constructive, algorithmic, and proof-theoretic perspective, framed within the theory of computable functionals. Key examples include B\'ezout's identity, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and Fermat's factorisation method. All definitions and theorems are fully formalised in the proof assistant Minlog, laying the foundation for a comprehensive formal framework for number theory within Minlog. While formalisation guarantees correctness, the primary emphasis is on the computational content of proofs. Leveraging Minlog's built-in program extraction, we obtain executable terms and export them as Haskell code. The efficiency of the extracted programs plays a central role. We show how performance considerations influence even the initial formulation of theorems and proofs. In particular, we compare formalisations based on binary encodings of natural numbers with those using the traditional unary (successor-based) representation. We present several core proofs in detail and reflect on the challenges that arise from formalisation in contrast to informal reasoning. The complete formalisation is available online and linked throughout. Minlog's tactic scripts are designed to follow the structure of natural-language proofs, allowing each derivation step to be traced precisely and thereby bridging the gap between formal and classical mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of Reinhardt cardinals with $\mathsf{ZF}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proof will be presented that the existence of a non-trivial $\Sigma_1$-elementary embedding $j: V_{\lambda+3} \prec V_{\lambda+3}$ is inconsistent with $\textsf{ZF}$. Sections 1 and 2 shall review various important contributions from the literature, notably including \cite{Goldberg2020}, \cite{Schlutzenberg2020}, and \cite{Woodin2010}, the latter reference being where the crucial forcing construction is presented. Section 3 shall introduce some new large cardinal properties, of consistency strength intermediate between $\mathsf{I_3}$ and $\mathsf{I_2}$, and greater than $\mathsf{I_1}$, respectively. The proof of the inconsistency with $\mathsf{ZF}$ of the existence of a non-trivial $\Sigma_1$-elementary embedding $j:V_{\lambda+3} \prec V_{\lambda+3}$ shall be given in Section 4. The claims of Sections 2 and 4 are provable in $\textsf{ZF}$; those of Section 3, with the exception of the last two theorems, in $\textsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <title>On $NP \cap coNP$ proof complexity generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of proof complexity generators we consider the following $\Sigma^p_2$ search problem $\mbox{DD}_P$ determined by a propositional proof system $P$: given a $P$-proof $\pi$ of a disjunction $\bigvee_i \alpha_i$, no two $\alpha_i$ having an atom in common, find $i$ such that $\alpha_i \in \mbox{TAUT}$. We formulate a hypothesis (ST) that for some strong proof system $P$ the problem $\mbox{DD}_P$ is not solvable in the student-teacher model with a p-time student and a constant number of rounds. The hypothesis follows from the existence of hard one-way permutations. We prove, using a model-theoretic assumption, that (ST) implies $NP \neq coNP$. The assumption concerns the existence of extensions of models of a bounded arithmetic theory and it is open at present if it holds.</description>
