      <title>Structural chirality and related properties in the periodic inorganic solids: Review and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality refers to the asymmetry of objects that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image. It is a concept that exists in various scientific fields and has profound consequences. Although these are perhaps most widely recognized within biology, chemistry, and pharmacology, recent advances in chiral phonons, topological systems, crystal enantiomorphic materials, and magneto-chiral materials have brought this topic to the forefront of condensed matter physics research. Our review discusses the symmetry requirements and the features associated with structural chirality in inorganic materials. This allows us to explore the nature of phase transitions in these systems, the coupling between order parameters, and their impact on the material's physical properties. We highlight essential contributions to the field, particularly recent progress in the study of chiral phonons, altermagnetism, magnetochirality between others. Despite the rarity of naturally occurring inorganic chiral crystals, this review also highlights a significant knowledge gap, presenting challenges and opportunities for structural chirality mostly at the fundamental level, e.g., chiral displacive phase transitions and ferrochirality, possibilities of tuning and switching structural chirality by external means (electric, magnetic, or strain fields), whether chirality could be an independent order parameter, and whether structural chirality could be quantified, etc. Beyond simply summarising this field of research, this review aims to inspire further research in materials science by addressing future challenges, encouraging the exploration of chirality beyond traditional boundaries, and seeking the development of innovative materials with superior or new properties.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear photomagnetization in insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear photomagnetization is a process by which an oscillating electric field can induce a static magnetization. We show that all 32 crystallographic point groups admit spin polarization to second order using circularly polarized electric fields (as in the usual spin orientation) but only 29 points groups admit spin polarization to second order using linearly polarized electric fields. The excluded point groups are the highly symmetric $m$-3$m$, -$43m$ and 432. To illustrate our results, we compute the second order electric spin susceptibility of Te, Se, SnS$_2$, GaAs, InSb and Si using density functional theory which corresponds to nonmagnetic materials with and without inversion symmetry. We show that our nonlinear photomagnetization can reach magnetic moments of 0.39 $\mu_B/\text{atom}$ comparable to those of naturally occurring ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Gas permeability, diffusivity, and solubility in polymers: Simulation-experiment data fusion and multi-task machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models for predicting gas permeability through polymers have traditionally relied on experimental data. While these models exhibit robustness within familiar chemical domains, reliability wanes when applied to new spaces. To address this challenge, we present a multi-tiered multi-task learning framework empowered with advanced machine-crafted polymer fingerprinting algorithms and data fusion techniques. This framework combines scarce "high-fidelity" experimental data with abundant diverse "low-fidelity" simulation or synthetic data, resulting in predictive models that display a high level of generalizability across novel chemical spaces. Additionally, this multi-task scheme capitalizes on known physics and interrelated properties, such as gas diffusivity and solubility, both of which are closely tied to permeability. By amalgamating high-throughput generated simulation data with available experimental data for gas permeability, diffusivity, and solubility for various gases, we construct multi-task deep learning models. These models can simultaneously predict all three properties for all gases under consideration. With markedly enhanced predictive accuracy, particularly compared to traditional models reliant solely on experimental data for a singular property. This strategy underscores the potential of coupling high-throughput classical simulations with data fusion methodologies to yield state-of-the-art property predictors, especially when experimental data for targeted properties is scarce.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the origin of interface stress enhancement and compressive-to-tensile stress transition in immiscible nanomultilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic stress in nanomultilayers (NMLs) is typically dominated by interface stress, which is particularly high in immiscible Cu/W NMLs. Here, atomistic simulations with a chemically-accurate neural network potential reveal the role of interfacial intermixing and metastable phase formation on the interface stress levels. These results rationalize an experimentally-reported compressive- to-tensile transition as a function of NML deposition conditions and the extremely high interface stresses under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Dislocation cartography: Representations and unsupervised classification of dislocation networks with unique fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting structure in data is the first step to arrive at meaningful representations for systems. This is particularly challenging for dislocation networks evolving as a consequence of plastic deformation of crystalline systems. Our study employs Isomap, a manifold learning technique, to unveil the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional density field data of dislocation structures from different compression axis. The resulting maps provide a systematic framework for quantitatively comparing dislocation structures, offering unique fingerprints based on density fields. Our novel, unbiased approach contributes to the quantitative classification of dislocation structures which can be systematically extended.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Irradiation Resistance in Refractory Medium Entropy Alloys with Simplified Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory High-Entropy Alloys (RHEAs) hold promising potential to be used as structural materials in future nuclear fusion reactors, where W and its alloys are currently leading candidates. Fusion materials must be able to withstand extreme conditions, such as (i) severe radiation-damage arising from highly-energetic neutrons, (ii) embrittlement caused by implantation of H and He ions, and (iii) exposure to extreme high-temperatures and thermal gradients. Recent research demonstrated that two RHEAs - the WTaCrV and WTaCrVHf - can outperform both coarse-grained and nanocrystalline W in terms of its radiation response and microstructural stability. Chemical complexity and nanocrystallinity enhance the radiation tolerance of these new RHEAs, but their multi-element nature, including low-melting Cr, complicates bulk fabrication and limits practical applications. We demonstrate that reducing the number of alloying elements and yet retain high-radiation tolerance is possible within the ternary system W-Ta-V via synthesis of two novel nanocrystalline refractory medium-entropy alloys (RMEAs): the W$_{53}$Ta$_{44}$V$_{3}$ and W$_{53}$Ta$_{42}$V$_{5}$ (in at.\%). We experimentally show that the radiation response of the W-Ta-V system can be tailored by small additions of V, and such experimental result was validated with theoretical analysis of chemical short-range orders (CSRO) from combined ab-initio atomistic Monte-Carlo modeling. It is predicted from computational analysis that a small change in V concentration has a significant effect on the Ta-V CRSO between W$_{53}$Ta$_{44}$V$_{3}$ and W$_{53}$Ta$_{42}$V$_{5}$ leading to radiation-resistant microstructures in these RMEAs from chemistry stand-point of views. We deviate from the original high-entropy alloy concept to show that high radiation resistance can be achieved in systems with simplified chemical complexity.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions, Dirac and WSM states in $\mathrm{Mn}_{1-x} \mathrm{Ge}_x \mathrm{Bi}_2 \mathrm{Te}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT), an experimental and theoretical study of changes in the electronic structure (dispersion dependencies) and corresponding modification of the energy band gap at the Dirac point (DP) for topological insulator (TI) $\mathrm{Mn}_{1-x} \mathrm{Ge}_x \mathrm{Bi}_2 \mathrm{Te}_4$ have been carried out with gradual replacement of magnetic Mn atoms by non-magnetic Ge atoms when concentration of the latter was varied from 10$\%$ to 75$\%$. It was shown that when Ge concentration increases then the bulk band gap decreases and reaches zero plateau in the concentration range of 45$\%$-60$\%$ while non-topological surface states (TSS) are present and exhibit an energy splitting of 100 and 70 meV in different types of measurements. It was also shown that TSS disappear from the measured band dispersions at a Ge concentration of about 40$\%$. DFT calculations of $\mathrm{Mn}_{1-x} \mathrm{Ge}_x \mathrm{Bi}_2 \mathrm{Te}_4$ band structure were carried out to identify the nature of observed band dispersion features and to analyze a possibility of magnetic Weyl semimetal state formation in this system. These calculations were performed for both antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) ordering types while the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength was varied or a strain (compression or tension) along the $c$-axis was applied. Calculations show that two different series of topological phase transitions (TPTs) may be implemented in this system depending on the magnetic ordering. At AFM ordering transition between TI and trivial insulator phase goes through the Dirac semimetal state, whereas for FM phase such route admits three intermediate states instead of one (TI - Dirac semimetal - Weyl semimetal - Dirac semimetal - trivial insulator).</description>

      <title>Stress induced martensitic transformation in NiTi at elevated temperatures: martensite variant microstructures, recoverable strains and plastic strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional behavior of NiTi shape memory alloys is restricted to temperatures below 150 {\deg}C. To shed light on the origin of the loss of functional properties of NiTi with increasing temperature, we have investigated stress induced martensitic transformations in nanocrystalline NiTi shape memory wire by thermomechanical testing supplemented with post-mortem reconstruction of martensite variant microstructures in grains by transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the forward stress induced martensitic transformation proceeding via propagation of macroscopic Luders band fronts in stress plateaus is not completed at the end of the stress plateau and generates unrecoverable plastic strain in addition to recoverable transformation strain. The higher the test temperature, the larger is the plastic strain as well as the volume fraction of retained austenite. The reconstructed martensite variant microstructures in grains of the NiTi wire deformed up to the end of the stress plateau at 120 {\deg}C were found to be filled with single domains of (001) compound twin laminate, some grains were nearly detwinned and some grains contained (100) deformation twins. The recoverable transformation strain (~6%) generated by the forward martensitic transformation is nearly independent on the test temperature (plateau stress) because detwinning of (001) compound twins in the microstructure is prohibited by lateral constraint from the surrounding grains in nanocrystalline wire. It is concluded that the gradual loss of functionality of NiTi with increasing temperature does not originate from the plastic deformation of austenite, but that it derives from the lack of resistance of the stress induced martensite to the plastic deformation under increasing stress.</description>

      <title>Recoverable and plastic strains generated by forward and reverse martensitic transformations under external stress in NiTi SMA wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superelastic NiTi 1 shape memory alloy (SMA) wire was subjected to thermomechanical loading tests in tension to evaluate stress and temperature conditions under which the wire deforms plastically. Although the alloy demonstrated a very high resistance to plastic deformation in both the austenite and martensite phases, incremental plastic strains were recorded whenever the B2 cubic to B19' monoclinic martensitic transformation (MT) took place under external stress. To shed light on the origin of the functional fatigue presumably originating from the accumulated plastic strains, special closed-loop thermomechanical loading tests were performed to evaluate recoverable and plastic strains generated by the forward and reverse MTs under external stress. These experiments revealed that both forward and reverse MTs generate well-defined incremental plastic strains only if they occur above certain stress thresholds. Specifically, the forward MT upon cooling under stresses up to 500 MPa does not produce plastic strain or lattice defects, whereas the reverse MT upon heating generates plastic strains even under stress as low as 100 MPa. It is proposed that plastic deformation generated by martensitic transformations under low stresses takes place by [100](001) dislocation slip in martensite and while under high stresses it occurs via kwinking deformation in martensite. The characteristic thresholds and magnitudes of plastic strains generated by the forward and reverse MTs define the functional fatigue limits for NiTi. Specifically, the stress-strain-temperature responses recorded in closed-loop thermomechanical tests remain stable if both forward and reverse MTs occur below these thresholds. Conversely, they become unstable and exhibit predictable ratcheting if the MTs exceed these thresholds.</description>

      <title>Martensitic transformation induced by cooling NiTi wire under various tensile stresses: martensite variant microstructure, textures, recoverable strains and plastic strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand how martensitic transformation (MT) in polycrystalline NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) proceeds under external stress, we evaluated recoverable transformation strains and plastic strains generated by the forward MT in nanocrystalline NiTi wire cooled under tensile stresses 0-600 MPa, determined textures in martensite and reconstructed martensite variant microstructures within the selected grains of the cooled wire. The obtained findings show that the forward MT proceeding under external stresses gives rise to characteristic recoverable transformation strains, plastic strains, martensite variant microstructures and martensite textures. MT occurring upon cooling under stresses exceeding 100 MPa creates martensite variant microstructures consisting of single domain of partially detwinned laminate of (001) compound twins filling entire grains. The recoverable transformation strain increases with increasing stress, reaches maximum ~5% at ~200 MPa stress, and remains constant with further increasing stress up to 600 MPa. Starting from 100 MPa stress, the forward MT generates also plastic strains, the magnitude of which also increases with increasing stress. We propose that, in the absence of external stress, the forward MT takes place via propagation of strain compatible habit plane interfaces between austenite and second order laminate of (001) compound twins. When the forward MT takes place under external tensile stress, it occurs equally, but the newly created martensite immediately reorients into single domains of (001) compound twins, partially detwins and deforms plastically under the action of the external stress. The plastic strain generated by the forward MT upon cooling under stress is attributed to the [100](001) dislocation slip in martensite at low stresses and plastic deformation of martensite by kwinking at high stresses.</description>

      <title>Predicting electronic screening for fast Koopmans spectral functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopmans spectral functionals represent a powerful extension of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT), enabling accurate predictions of spectral properties with state-of-the-art accuracy. The success of these functionals relies on capturing the effects of electronic screening through scalar, orbital-dependent parameters. These parameters have to be computed for every calculation, making Koopmans spectral functionals more expensive than their DFT counterparts. In this work, we present a machine-learning model that -- with minimal training -- can predict these screening parameters directly from orbital densities calculated at the DFT level. We show on two prototypical use cases that using the screening parameters predicted by this model, instead of those calculated from linear response, leads to orbital energies that differ by less than 20 meV on average. Since this approach dramatically reduces run-times with minimal loss of accuracy, it will enable the application of Koopmans spectral functionals to classes of problems that previously would have been prohibitively expensive, such as the prediction of temperature-dependent spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic modeling of the LiCl-KCl-LaCl$_3$ system with Bayesian model selection and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chloride molten salts are increasingly recognized for their applications in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding the thermodynamic properties of these molten salts is essential to optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), are utilized to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor was used to guide model selection process for the thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl$_3$ system and provide statistical comparisons of liquid models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable model based on the available thermochemical data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl$_3$ system was further optimized with uncertainty quantification using MQMQA. The thermodynamic properties of compounds in the KCl-LaCl$_3$ system were obtained from DFT-based phonon calculations. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate model is important for accurately predicting the behavior of complex molten salts.</description>

      <title>The Wetting of H$_2$O by CO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphasic interfaces are complex but fascinating regimes that display a number of properties distinct from those of the bulk. The CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface, in particular, has been the subject of a number of studies on account of its importance for the carbon life cycle as well as carbon capture and sequestration schemes. Despite this attention, there remain a number of open questions on the nature of the CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface, particularly concerning the interfacial tension and phase behavior of CO$_2$ at the interface. In this paper, we seek to address these ambiguities using ab initio-quality simulations. Harnessing the benefits of machine-learned potentials and enhanced statistical sampling methods, we present an ab initio-level description of the CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface. Interfacial tensions are predicted from 1-500 bar and found to be in close agreement with experiment at the pressures for which experimental data is available. Structural analyses indicate the build-up of an adsorbed, saturated CO$_2$ film forming at low pressure (20 bar) with properties similar to those of the bulk liquid, but preferential perpendicular alignment with respect to the interface. CO$_2$ monolayer build-up coincides with a reduced structuring of water molecules close to the interface. This study highlights the predictive nature of machine-learned potentials for complex macroscopic properties of biphasic interfaces, and the mechanistic insight obtained into carbon dioxide aggregation at the water interface is of high relevance for geoscience, climate research, and materials science.</description>

Abstract: Tin telluride (SnTe) is an IV-VI semiconductor with a topological crystalline insulator band structure, high thermoelectric performance, and in-plane ferroelectricity. Despite its many applications, there has been little work focused on understanding the growth mechanisms of SnTe thin films. In this manuscript, we investigate the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) synthesis of SnTe (111) thin films on InP (111)A substrates. We explore the effect of substrate temperature, Te:Sn flux ratio, and growth rate on the film quality. Using a substrate temperature of 340 {\deg}C, a Te:Sn flux ratio of 3, and a growth rate of 0.48 {\AA}/s, fully coalesced and single crystalline SnTe (111) epitaxial layers with x-ray rocking curve full-width-at-half-maxima (FWHM) of 0.09{\deg} and root-mean-square surface roughness as low as 0.2 nm have been obtained. Despite the 7.5% lattice mismatch between the SnTe (111) film and the InP (111)A substrate, reciprocal space mapping indicates that the 15 nm SnTe layer is fully relaxed. We show that a periodic interfacial misfit (IMF) dislocation array forms at the SnTe/InP heterointerface, where each IMF dislocation is separated by 14 InP lattice sites/13 SnTe lattice sites, providing rapid strain relaxation and yielding the high quality SnTe layer. This is the first report of an IMF array forming in a rock-salt on zinc-blende material system and at an IV-VI on III-V heterointerface, and highlights the potential for SnTe as a buffer layer for epitaxial telluride film growth. This work represents an important milestone in enabling the heterointegration between IV-VI and III-V semiconductors to create multifunctional devices.</description>

      <title>Tailored topotactic chemistry unlocks heterostructures of magnetic intercalation compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of thin film heterostructures has been a widely successful archetype for fabricating materials with emergent physical properties. This strategy is of particular importance for the design of multilayer magnetic architectures in which direct interfacial spin--spin interactions between magnetic phases in dissimilar layers lead to emergent and controllable magnetic behavior. However, crystallographic incommensurability and atomic-scale interfacial disorder can severely limit the types of materials amenable to this strategy, as well as the performance of these systems. Here, we demonstrate a method for synthesizing heterostructures comprising magnetic intercalation compounds of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), through directed topotactic reaction of the TMD with a metal oxide. The mechanism of the intercalation reaction enables thermally initiated intercalation of the TMD from lithographically patterned oxide films, giving access to a new family of multi-component magnetic architectures through the combination of deterministic van der Waals assembly and directed intercalation chemistry.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-controlled SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 magnetic tunnel junctions:Spin polarization and its relevance to tunneling magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), that consist of two ferromagnetic electrodes separated by an insulating barrier layer, have non-trivial fundamental properties associated with spin-dependent tunneling. Especially interesting are fully crystalline MTJs where spin-dependent tunneling is controlled by the symmetry group of wave vector. In this work, using first-principles quantum-transport calculations, we explore spin-dependent tunneling in fully crystalline SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 (001) MTJs and predict tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of nearly 3000%. We demonstrate that this giant TMR effect is driven by symmetry matching (mismatching) of the incoming and outcoming Bloch states in the SrRuO3 (001) electrodes and evanescent states in the SrTiO3 (001) barrier. We argue that under the conditions of symmetry-controlled transport, spin polarization, whatever definition is used, is not a relevant measure of spin-dependent tunneling. In the presence of diffuse scattering, however, e.g. due to localized states in the band gap of the tunnel barrier, symmetry matching is no longer valid and TMR in SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 (001) MTJs is strongly reduced. Under these conditions, the spin polarization of the interface transmission function becomes a valid measure of TMR. These results provide an important insight into understanding and optimizing TMR in all-oxide MTJs.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Influence of Surface Sanding Technique and Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotube Incorporation on the Mode I Fracture Behavior of Glass Composite Laminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study sequentially investigates the enhancement of fracture behavior in adhesive joints. Initially, mechanical sanding techniques were explored, revealing significant improvements of 55% in fracture energy and 38% in load-bearing capacity with optimal 240-grit sanding. Subsequently, in a second stage, Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) were introduced at varying weight percentages (0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5% by weight) into the adhesive joints. This combined approach aimed to synergistically examine the impact of surface pretreatments and nanoparticle integration on fracture behavior. Results highlight the potential for fracture resistance and enhanced load-carrying capabilities in reinforced specimens, with maximum load and fracture energy improvements of up to 92 % and 50 %, respectively, compared to unreinforced specimens and those subjected solely to sanding treatments. Furthermore, the fracture mode shifted from adhesive failure to cohesive substrate failure in reinforced specimens. This comprehensive investigation underscores the intricate interplay between mechanical preparation and nanomaterial incorporation in significantly improving adhesive joint performance</description>

      <title>Discovery of Novel Silicon Allotropes with Optimized Band Gaps to Enhance Solar Cell Efficiency through Evolutionary Algorithms and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15316v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing solar energy technologies, this study presents 20 direct and quasi-direct band gap silicon crystalline semiconductors that satisfy the Shockley-Queisser limit, a benchmark for solar cell efficiency. Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures. Input data for machine learning models are derived from structural MBTR and SOAP descriptors, as well as DFT outputs. Notably, the results reveal that features extracted from DFT outperform the MBTR and SOAP descriptors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of novel materials in recent years has been accelerated greatly by the use of computational modelling techniques aimed at elucidating the complex physics controlling microstructure formation in materials, the properties of which control material function. One such technique is the phase field method, a field theoretic approach that couples various thermophysical fields to microscopic order parameter fields that track the phases of microstructure. Phase field models are framed as multiple, non-linear, partial differential equations, which are extremely challenging to compute efficiently. Recent years have seen an explosion of computational algorithms aimed at enhancing the efficiency of phase field simulations. One such technique, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), dynamically adapts numerical meshes to be highly refined around steep spatial gradients of the PDE fields and coarser where the fields are smooth. This reduces the number of computations per time step significantly, thus reducing the total time of computation. What AMR doesn't do is allow for adaptive time stepping. This work combines AMR with a neural network algorithm that uses a U-Net with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (CLSTM) base to accelerate phase field simulations. Our neural network algorithm is described in detail and tested in on simulations of directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy, a paradigm that is highly practical for its relevance to the solidification of alloys.</description>

      <title>Bayesian neural networks for predicting uncertainty in full-field material response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress and material deformation field predictions are among the most important tasks in computational mechanics. These predictions are typically made by solving the governing equations of continuum mechanics using finite element analysis, which can become computationally prohibitive considering complex microstructures and material behaviors. Machine learning (ML) methods offer potentially cost effective surrogates for these applications. However, existing ML surrogates are either limited to low-dimensional problems and/or do not provide uncertainty estimates in the predictions. This work proposes an ML surrogate framework for stress field prediction and uncertainty quantification for diverse materials microstructures. A modified Bayesian U-net architecture is employed to provide a data-driven image-to-image mapping from initial microstructure to stress field with prediction (epistemic) uncertainty estimates. The Bayesian posterior distributions for the U-net parameters are estimated using three state-of-the-art inference algorithms: the posterior sampling-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method and two variational approaches, the Monte-Carlo Dropout method and the Bayes by Backprop algorithm. A systematic comparison of the predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimates for these methods is performed for a fiber reinforced composite material and polycrystalline microstructure application. It is shown that the proposed methods yield predictions of high accuracy compared to the FEA solution, while uncertainty estimates depend on the inference approach. Generally, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop methods provide consistent uncertainty estimates. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo Dropout, on the other hand, are more difficult to interpret and depend strongly on the method's design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work overviews a new, recent success of phase-field modelling: its application to predicting the evolution of the corrosion front and the associated structural integrity challenges. Despite its important implications for society, predicting corrosion damage has been an elusive goal for scientists and engineers. The application of phase-field modelling to corrosion not only enables tracking the electrolyte-metal interface but also provides an avenue to explicitly simulate the underlying mesoscale physical processes. This lays the grounds for developing the first generation of mechanistic corrosion models, which can capture key phenomena such as film rupture and repassivation, the transition from activation- to diffusion-controlled corrosion, interactions with mechanical fields, microstructural and electrochemical effects, intergranular corrosion, material biodegradation, and the interplay with other environmentally-assisted damage phenomena such as hydrogen embrittlement.</description>

      <title>Thermal activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory, which emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled, possesses eight types of relativistic particles whose mass spectrum and scattering matrices are organized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ algebra. It is predicted that all odd-parity particles are dark and cannot be directly excited from the ground state. This makes these dark particles hard to be detected. Here, we study the local dynamical spin structure factor of the model at low-frequencies and low-temperatures. In contrast to the invisibility of the dark particles in THz spectroscopy or inelastic neutron scattering measurement, we find that the lightest dark particle is detectable, manifested as a thermal activation gap in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

      <title>Harvesting magneto-acoustic waves using magnetic two-dimensional chromium telluride (CrTe3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vast majority of electrical devices have integrated magnetic units, which generate constant magnetic fields with noticeable vibrations. The majority of existing nanogenerators acquire energy through friction/mechanical forces and most of these instances overlook acoustic vibrations and magnetic fields. Magnetic two-dimensional (2D) tellurides present a wide range of possibilities for devising a potential flexible energy harvester. We have synthesized two-dimensional chromium telluride (2D CrTe3) which exhibits ferromagnetic (FM) nature with a Tc of 224 K. The structure exhibits stable high remnant magnetization, making 2D CrTe3 flakes a potential material for harvesting of magneto-acoustic waves at room temperature. A magneto-acoustic nanogenerator (MANG) was fabricated composing of 2D CrTe3 dispersed in a polymer matrix. Basic mechanical stability and sensitivity of the device with change in load conditions were tested. A high surface charge density of 2.919 mC m-2 was obtained for the device. The thermal strain created in the lattice structure was examined using in-situ Raman spectroscopic measurements. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) responsible for long-range FM ordering was calculated with the help of theoretical modelling. The theoretical calculations also showed opening of electronic bandgap which enhances the flexoelectric effects. The MANG can be a potential energy harvester to synergistically tap into the magneto-acoustic vibrations generated from the frequency changes of a vibrating device such as loudspeakers.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent properties of transparent conductive oxides for epsilon-near-zero applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have attracted much attention due to their unique properties that can be tuned under electrical and optical signals. Furthermore, they allow for a strong enhancement of a nonlinearity close to the ENZ regime, which can have a direct impact on many fields ranging from telecommunications, sensing, quantum optics, to neuromorphic computing. Among the many materials belonging to the ENZ class, transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) are of particular interest because they are very well known to the community and possess very well understood electrical and optical properties. This work extends the direct control of the optical properties of transparent conductive oxides by tailoring the film thickness, which opens new possibilities for ENZ-enhanced photonic applications. It is shown that the thickness-dependent ENZ resonance in the TCO films is equivalent to the power-dependent ENZ resonance as for the same amount of power provided to the TCO film the electric field confinement in the thinner films is highly enhanced for TM polarized light, resulting in the higher electrons effective mass. Thus, the optical properties of TCO can be optically tuned in the ENZ regime, which opens possibilities for a new type of devices that can operate under all-optical switching mechanism.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modeling of superconducting alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing new, technologically relevant superconductors has long been at the forefront of solid-state physics and chemistry research. However, developing efficient approaches for modeling the thermodynamics of superconducting alloys while accurately evaluating their physical properties has proven to be a very challenging task. To fill this gap, we propose an ab initio thermodynamic statistical method, the Extended Generalized Quasichemical Approximation (EGQCA), to describe off-stoichiometric superconductors. Within EGQCA, one can predict any computationally accessible property of the alloy, such as the critical temperature in superconductors and the electron-phonon coupling parameter, as a function of composition and crystal growth conditions by computing the cluster occurrence probabilities that minimize the overall mixing Gibbs free energy. Importantly, EGQCA incorporates directly chemical ordering, lattice distortions, and vibrational contributions. As a proof of concept, we applied EGQCA to the well-known Al-doped MgB$_2$ and to niobium alloyed with titanium and vanadium, showing a remarkable agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, we model the near-room temperature sodalite-like Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$H$_6$ superconducting solid solution, demonstrating that EGQCA particularly possesses a promising potential for designing in silico high-$T_{\text{c}}$ superhydride alloys. Our approach notably enables the high-throughput screening of complex superconducting solid solutions, intrinsically providing valuable insights into the interplay between synthesis, thermodynamics, and physical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pairing mechanism behind the monolayer FeSe is one essential question for iron-based superconductors. In this work, we show the sublattice degree of freedoms of monolayer FeSe plays a special role in its pairing properties, namely the sublattice dichotomy. The high-quality monolayer FeSe samples with atomic flat $1\times1$ topography on the SrTiO$_3$(001) substrates are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By comparing the tunneling spectra at $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fe sublattices, we find the coherence peak of $\alpha$-Fe at the inner gap $+V_i$ is higher than $\beta$-Fe while the coherence peak of $\beta$-Fe at $-V_i$ is higher than $\alpha$-Fe with a similar amount. We also observed a reversed effect at the outer gap $\pm V_o$. We propose the $\eta$-pairing mechanism between $k$ and $-k+Q$ is the key mechanism for this unconventional sublattice dichotomy effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for materials with large thermopower is of great practical interest. Dirac and Weyl semimetals have recently proven to exhibit superior thermoelectric properties, particularly when subjected to a quantizing magnetic field. Here we consider whether a similar enhancement arises in nodal line semimetals, for which the conduction and valence band meet at a line or ring in momentum space. We compute the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients for arbitrary temperature and magnetic field and we find a wealth of different scaling regimes. Most strikingly, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied along the direction of a straight nodal line or in the plane of a nodal ring, the large degeneracy of states leads to a large, linear-in-$B$ thermopower that is temperature-independent even at low temperatures. Our results suggest that nodal line semimetals may offer significant opportunity for efficient, low-temperature thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of hole mobility for 4H-silicon carbide through suppressing interband electron-phonon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC) possesses a high Baliga figure of merit, making it a promising material for power electronics. However, its applications are limited by its low hole mobility. Herein, we found that the hole mobility of 4H-SiC is mainly limited by the strong interband electron-phonon scattering using mode-level first-principles calculations. Our research indicates that applying compressive strain can reverse the sign of crystal-field splitting and change the ordering of electron bands close to the valence band maximum. Therefore, the interband electron-phonon scattering is severely suppressed, and the out-of-plane hole mobility of 4H-SiC can be enhanced by 200% with 2% uniaxial compressive strain applied. This work provides new insights into the electron transport mechanisms in semiconductors and suggests a strategy to improve hole mobility that could be applied to other semiconductors with hexagonal crystalline geometries.</description>

Abstract: The boron nitride (BN) analogue of 8-16-4 graphyne, termed SBNyne, is proposed for the first time. Its physical properties were explored using first-principles calculations and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Thermal stability assessments reveal that SBNyne maintains structural integrity up to 1000 K. We found that SBNyne exhibits a wide indirect bandgap of 4.58 eV using HSE06 and 3.20 eV using PBE. It displays strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet region while remaining transparent in the infrared and visible regions. Additionally, SBNyne exhibits significantly lower thermal conductivity compared to h-BN. Phonon spectrum analysis indicates that out-of-plane phonons predominantly contribute to the vibrational density of states only at very low frequencies, explaining its low thermal conductivity. These findings expand the knowledge of BN-based 2D materials and open new avenues for their design and advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Negative Refraction in isotropic achiral and chiral materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that negative refraction in materials can occur at frequencies $\omega$ where the real parts of the permittivity $\veps(\omega)$ and the permeability $\mu(\omega)$ have different sign, and that light with such frequencies can propagate just as well as light with frequencies where they have equal sign. Therefore, for negative refraction one does not need to be in the ``double-negative'' regime. We consider negative refractive index achiral materials using the Drude-Lorentz model and chiral materials using the Drude-Born-Fedorov model. We find that the time-averaged Poynting vector always points along the wave vector, the time-averaged energy-flux density is always positive, and the time-averaged energy density is positive (negative) when the refractive index is positive (negative). The phase velocity is negative when the real part of the refractive index is negative, and the group velocity generally changes sign several times as a function of frequency near resonance.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance hysteresis in the superconduting state of Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hysteresis of magnetoresistance observed in superconductors is of great interest due to its potential connection with unconventional superconductivity. In this study, we perform electrical transport measurements on Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ nanoflakes and uncover unusual hysteretic behaviour of magnetoresistance in the superconducting state. This hysteresis can be induced by applying either a large DC or AC current at temperatures ($T$) well below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). As $T$ approaches $T_{\rm c}$, similar weak hysteresis is also detected by applying a small current. Various scenarios are discussed, with particular focus on the effects of vortex pinning and the presence of time-reversal-symmtery-breaking superconducting domains. Our findings support the latter, hinting at chiral superconductivity in Kagome superconductors.</description>
