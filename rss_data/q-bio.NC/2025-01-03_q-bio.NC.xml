      <title>A data-driven biophysical network model reproduces C. elegans premotor neural dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: C. elegans locomotion is composed of switches between forward and reversal states punctuated by turns. This locomotory capability is necessary for the nematode to move towards attractive stimuli, escape noxious chemicals, and explore its environment. Although experimentalists have identified a number of premotor neurons as drivers of forward and reverse motion, how these neurons work together to produce the behaviors observed remains to be understood. Towards a better understanding of C. elegans neurodynamics, we present in this paper a minimally parameterized, biophysical dynamical systems model of the premotor network. Our model consists of a recurrently connected collection of premotor neurons (the core group) driven by over a hundred sensory and interneurons that provide diverse feedforward inputs to the core group. It is data-driven in the sense that the choice of neurons in the core group follows experimental guidance, anatomical structures are dictated by the connectome, and physiological parameters are deduced from whole-brain imaging and voltage clamps data. When simulated with realistic input signals, our model produces premotor activity that closely resembles experimental data: from the seemingly random switching between forward and reversal behaviors to the synchronization of subnetworks to various higher-order statistics. We posit that different roles are played by gap junctions and synaptic connections in switching dynamics. The model correctly predicts behavior such as dwelling versus roaming as a result of the synaptic inputs received, and we demonstrate that it can be used to study how the activity level of certain individual neurons impacts behavior.</description>

      <title>The Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of Multimodal Movies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing symbiosis between artificial and biological intelligence sciences: neural principles inspire new intelligent machines, which are in turn used to advance our theoretical understanding of the brain. To promote further collaboration between biological and artificial intelligence researchers, we introduce the 2025 edition of the Algonauts Project challenge: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of Multimodal Movies (https://algonautsproject.com/). In collaboration with the Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling (CNeuroMod), this edition aims to bring forth a new generation of brain encoding models that are multimodal and that generalize well beyond their training distribution, by training them on the largest dataset of fMRI responses to movie watching available to date. Open to all, the 2025 challenge provides transparent, directly comparable results through a public leaderboard that is updated automatically after each submission to facilitate rapid model assessment and guide development. The challenge will end with a session at the 2025 Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN) conference that will feature winning models. We welcome researchers interested in collaborating with the Algonauts Project by contributing ideas and datasets for future challenges.</description>

      <title>Realistic overground gait transitions are not sharp but involve gradually changing walk-run mixtures as per energy optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans use two qualitatively different gaits for locomotion, namely, walking and running -- usually using walking at lower speeds and running at higher speeds. Researchers have examined when humans switch between walking and running on treadmills and have noted hystereses in these gait transition speeds. Here, we consider an ecologically realistic overground locomotion task, one requiring traveling a given long distance (800 meters or 2400 meters) in a prescribed time duration. Unlike on a treadmill, this task allows the human to change speed or gait during the trial to reach the destination on time: this task is akin to traveling to an appointment at a particular time from your office to another office, arriving neither early or late. We find that gait transition is not sharp, but instead involves a 'gait transition regime' in which humans use a mixture of walking and running, using mostly walking atlower speeds and mostly running higher speeds -- supporting earlier results over short distances (120 m). The presence of this gradually changing walk-run mixture is predicted by energy optimality. We hypothesize that this energy optimal behavior in this realistic overground conditions accounts for the hysteretic behavior in treadmill experiments, apparently switching earlier than predicted by energy optimality.</description>

      <title>Towards an integrative approach to the study of brain-environment interactions in human and non-human primate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By retracing my scientific journey that began 20 years ago, I highlight in this thesis the need to consider the organization of the brain, which is certainly globally hierarchical, but also highly distributed and mixed in the neuronal response of its different areas (by focusing on the sensorimotor cortex-basal ganglia network). I also emphasize the importance of adopting behavioral paradigms that reflect as much as possible the characteristics of the scenarios encountered in the real life of animals. And finally, I mention the importance of "disintegrating" the way data analysis is traditionally carried out, and of taking into account the dynamic nature of behavior, for example by favoring the study of behavioral variables and so-called "latent" neuronal activities. I conclude this thesis by presenting the vision of my ideal laboratory in a perspective of 5 to 10 years from today. This laboratory would have two experimental devices, a first, classic, for carrying out tests in a constrained and therefore unnatural environment, the data of which would be compared to those from a second device called "naturalistic" in which the animals could potentially express their entire behavioral repertoire. The tasks tested would be characterized by strong ecological principles, such as in those simulating the properties of foraging, and the data would make it possible to test hypotheses based on the progressive addition of ecological components in these tasks, all this in order to maintain control over the interpretability of these data which are complex by nature.</description>

      <title>Recursive introversion, iterative extroversion and transitive ambiversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an approach to describing personality dynamics through mathematical modelling of introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion processes. Introversion is interpreted as a recursive process characterized by deep self-awareness and inner reflection; extroversion is presented as an iterative process of accumulating and processing external stimuli; and ambiversion is considered transitivity, integrating the interaction of these two opposing processes. The developed model is based on principles of complex systems theory, nonlinear dynamics, and synergetics, enabling the perception of personality as an adaptive and multilayered system.
  The results include analytical equations describing the interaction of internal and external factors. Parameters regulating personality dynamics, such as sensitivity coefficients, weighting factors of stimuli, and synergy parameters, are also explored.
  The practical significance of the proposed model lies in its application in psychotherapy, education, personnel management, and other areas where it is necessary to consider personality traits and their dynamics. The model provides new opportunities for diagnosing, forecasting, and correcting personality changes, enhancing methods of working with individuals.
  The findings open some prospects for quantitative personality analysis, providing a theoretical understanding of its structure and dynamics. They also create a foundation for further interdisciplinary research in psychology, the cognitive sciences, and social systems.
  Specifically, the formalization considered in the context of program algorithms allows for the creation of functional procedures for AI and robots with differentiated psychological archetypes (introvert robots, extrovert robots, and ambivert robots).</description>

      <title>Efficient Connectivity-Preserving Instance Segmentation with Supervoxel-Based Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the intricate local morphology of neurons and their long-range projecting axons can address many connectivity related questions in neuroscience. The main bottleneck in connectomics pipelines is correcting topological errors, as multiple entangled neuronal arbors is a challenging instance segmentation problem. More broadly, segmentation of curvilinear, filamentous structures continues to pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we extend the notion of simple points from digital topology to connected sets of voxels (i.e. supervoxels) and propose a topology-aware neural network segmentation method with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a new public dataset of 3-d light microscopy images of mouse brains, along with the benchmark datasets DRIVE, ISBI12, and CrackTree.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic meaning, perception, and matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated information theory (IIT) argues that the substrate of consciousness is a maximally irreducible complex of units. Together, subsets of the complex specify a cause-effect structure, composed of distinctions and their relations, which accounts in full for the quality of experience. The feeling of a specific experience is also its meaning for the subject, which is thus defined intrinsically, regardless of whether the experience occurs in a dream or is triggered by processes in the environment. Here we extend IIT's framework to characterize the relationship between intrinsic meaning, extrinsic stimuli, and causal processes in the environment, illustrated using a simple model of a sensory hierarchy. We argue that perception should be considered as a structured interpretation, where a stimulus from the environment acts merely as a trigger for the complex's state and the structure is provided by the complex's intrinsic connectivity. We also propose that perceptual differentiation - the richness and diversity of structures triggered by representative sequences of stimuli - quantifies the meaningfulness of different environments to a complex. In adaptive systems, this reflects the "matching" between intrinsic meanings and causal processes in an environment.</description>

      <title>Preliminaries to artificial consciousness: a multidimensional heuristic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of artificial consciousness requires conceptual clarity to navigate its theoretical and empirical challenges. This paper introduces a composite, multilevel, and multidimensional model of consciousness as a heuristic framework to guide research in this field. Consciousness is treated as a complex phenomenon, with distinct constituents and dimensions that can be operationalized for study and for evaluating their replication. We argue that this model provides a balanced approach to artificial consciousness research by avoiding binary thinking (e.g., conscious vs. non-conscious) and offering a structured basis for testable hypotheses. To illustrate its utility, we focus on "awareness" as a case study, demonstrating how specific dimensions of consciousness can be pragmatically analyzed and targeted for potential artificial instantiation. By breaking down the conceptual intricacies of consciousness and aligning them with practical research goals, this paper lays the groundwork for a robust strategy to advance the scientific and technical understanding of artificial consciousness.</description>
