      <title>Algorithms and Lower Bounds for the Maximum Overlap of Two Polygons Under Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in shape matching and geometric similarity is computing the maximum area overlap between two polygons under translation. For general simple polygons, the best-known algorithm runs in $O((nm)^2 \log(nm))$ time [Mount, Silverman, Wu 96], where $n$ and $m$ are the complexities of the input polygons. In a recent breakthrough, Chan and Hair gave a linear-time algorithm for the special case when both polygons are convex. A key challenge in computational geometry is to design improved algorithms for other natural classes of polygons. We address this by presenting an $O((nm)^{3/2} \log(nm))$-time algorithm for the case when both polygons are orthogonal. This is the first algorithm for polygon overlap on orthogonal polygons that is faster than the almost 30 years old algorithm for simple polygons.
  Complementing our algorithmic contribution, we provide $k$-SUM lower bounds for problems on simple polygons with only orthogonal and diagonal edges. First, we establish that there is no algorithm for polygon overlap with running time $O(\max(n^2,nm^2)^{1-\varepsilon})$, where $m\leq n$, unless the $k$-SUM hypothesis fails. This matches the running time of our algorithm when $n=m$. We use part of the above construction to also show a lower bound for the polygon containment problem, a popular special case of the overlap problem. Concretely, there is no algorithm for polygon containment with running time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ under the $3$-SUM hypothesis, even when the polygon to be contained has $m=O(1)$ vertices. Our lower bound shows that polygon containment for these types of polygons (i.e., with diagonal edges) is strictly harder than for orthogonal polygons, and also strengthens the previously known lower bounds for polygon containment. Furthermore, our lower bounds show tightness of the algorithm of [Mount, Silverman, Wu 96] when $m=O(1)$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Unimodal Decomposition is NP-Hard on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A function on a topological space is called unimodal if all of its super-level sets are contractible. A minimal unimodal decomposition of a function $f$ is the smallest number of unimodal functions that sum up to $f$. The problem of decomposing a given density function into its minimal unimodal components is fundamental in topological statistics. We show that finding a minimal unimodal decomposition of an edge-linear function on a graph is NP-hard. Given any $k \geq 2$, we establish the NP-hardness of finding a unimodal decomposition consisting of $k$ unimodal functions. We also extend the NP-hardness result to related variants of the problem, including restriction to planar graphs, inapproximability results, and generalizations to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>All Polyhedral Manifolds are Connected by a 2-Step Refolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, for any two polyhedral manifolds $\mathcal P, \mathcal Q$, there is a polyhedral manifold $\mathcal I$ such that $\mathcal P, \mathcal I$ share a common unfolding and $\mathcal I,\mathcal Q$ share a common unfolding. In other words, we can unfold $\mathcal P$, refold (glue) that unfolding into $\mathcal I$, unfold $\mathcal I$, and then refold into $\mathcal Q$. Furthermore, if $\mathcal P, \mathcal Q$ have no boundary and can be embedded in 3D (without self-intersection), then so does $\mathcal I$. These results generalize to $n$ given manifolds $\mathcal P_1, \mathcal P_2, \dots, \mathcal P_n$; they all have a common unfolding with the same intermediate manifold $\mathcal I$. Allowing more than two unfold/refold steps, we obtain stronger results for two special cases: for doubly covered convex planar polygons, we achieve that all intermediate polyhedra are planar; and for tree-shaped polycubes, we achieve that all intermediate polyhedra are tree-shaped polycubes.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Algorithm for Shortest Paths in Unweighted Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given in the plane a set $S$ of $n$ points and a set of disks centered at these points, the disk graph $G(S)$ induced by these disks has vertex set $S$ and an edge between two vertices if their disks intersect. Note that the disks may have different radii. We consider the problem of computing shortest paths from a source point $s\in S$ to all vertices in $G(S)$ where the length of a path in $G(S)$ is defined as the number of edges in the path. The previously best algorithm solves the problem in $O(n\log^2 n)$ time. A lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$ is also known for this problem under the algebraic decision tree model. In this paper, we present an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm, which matches the lower bound and thus is optimal. Another virtue of our algorithm is that it is quite simple.</description>

      <title>Composable Coresets for Constrained Determinant Maximization and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study algorithms for construction of composable coresets for the task of Determinant Maximization under partition constraint. Given a point set $V\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ that is partitioned into $s$ groups $V_1,\cdots, V_s$, and integers $k_1,...,k_s$, where $k=\sum_i k_i$, the goal is to pick $k_i$ points from group $V_i$ such that the overall determinant of the picked $k$ points is maximized. Determinant Maximization and its constrained variants have gained a lot of interest for modeling diversity, and have found applications in the context of data summarization.
  When the cardinality $k$ of the selected set is greater than the dimension $d$, we show a peeling algorithm that gives us a composable coreset of size $kd$ with a provably optimal approximation factor of $d^{O(d)}.$ When $k\leq d$, we show a simple coreset construction with optimal size and approximation factor. As a further application of our technique, we get a composable coreset for determinant maximization under the more general laminar matroid constraints, and a composable coreset for unconstrained determinant maximization in a previously unresolved regime.
  Our results generalize to all strongly Rayleigh distributions and to several other experimental design problems. As an application, we improve the runtime of the practical local-search based algorithm of [Anari-Vuong--COLT'22] for determinantal maximization under partition constraint from $O(n^{2^s}k^{2^s})$ to $O(n k^{2^s})$, making it only linear on the number of points $n$.</description>

      <title>The Stamp Folding Problem From a Mountain-Valley Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We describe results on upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps, provide experimental evidence suggesting more general results, and include conjectures and open problems.</description>
