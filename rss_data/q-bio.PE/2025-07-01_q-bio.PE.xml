      <title>The Effect of Sporadic Dormancy on Adaptation under Natural Selection: A Formal Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers puzzle over questions as to how rare species survive extinction, and why a significant proportion of microbial taxa are dormant. Computational simulation modeling by a genetic algorithm provides some answers. First, a weak/rare/lowly-adapted species can obtain significantly higher fitness by resorting to sporadic dormancy; thereby the probability of extinction is reduced. Second, the extent of fitness-gain is greater when a higher fraction of the population is dormant; thus, the probability of species survival is greater for higher prevalence of dormancy. In sum, even when the environment is unfavorable initially and remains unchanged, sporadic dormancy enables a weak/rare species enhance the extent of favorable adaptation over time, successfully combating the forces of natural selection.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy law for certain classes of phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many classes of phylogenetic networks have been proposed in the literature. A feature of many of these classes is that if one restricts a network in the class to a subset of its leaves, then the resulting network may no longer lie within this class. This has implications for their biological applicability, since some species -- which are the leaves of an underlying evolutionary network -- may be missing (e.g., they may have become extinct, or there are no data available for them) or we may simply wish to focus attention on a subset of the species. On the other hand, certain classes of networks are `closed' when we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all phylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled networks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks that have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the number of reticulations, height, etc) bounded by some fixed value. It is easily shown that a closed subclass of phylogenetic trees is either all trees or a vanishingly small proportion of them (as the number of leaves grows). In this short paper, we explore whether this dichotomy phenomenon holds for other classes of phylogenetic networks, and their subclasses.</description>

      <title>Time-structured models of population growth in fluctuating environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1. Although environmental variability is expected to play a more prominent role under climate change, current demographic models that ignore the differential environmental histories of cohorts across generations are unlikely to accurately predict population dynamics and growth. The use of these approaches, which we collectively refer to as non time-structured models or nTSMs, will instead yield error-prone estimates by giving rise to a form of ecological memory loss due to their inability to account for the historical effects of past environmental exposure on subsequent growth rates.
  2. To address this important issue, we introduce a new class of time-structured models or TSMs that accurately depict growth under variable environments by splitting seemingly homogeneous populations into distinct demographic cohorts based on their past exposure to environmental fluctuations. By accounting for this cryptic population structure, TSMs accurately simulate the historical effects of environmental variability, even when individuals exhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity.
  3. Here, we provide a conceptual framework, the mathematical tools needed to simulate any TSM, and a closed form solution for simple exponential growth. We then show that traditional nTSMs yield large errors compared to TSMs when estimating population dynamics under fluctuating temperatures. Overall, TSMs represent a critical tool for predicting population growth in a variable world.</description>

      <title>Threshold behavior of a social norm in response to error proneness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A social norm defines what is good and what is bad in social contexts, as well as what to do based on such assessments. A stable social norm should be maintained against errors committed by its players. In addition, individuals may have different probabilities of errors in following the norm, and a social norm would be unstable if it benefited those who do not follow the norm carefully. In this work, we show that Simple Standing, which has been known to resist errors and mutants successfully, actually exhibits threshold behavior. That is, in a population of individuals playing the donation game according to Simple Standing, the residents can suppress the invasion of mutants with higher error proneness only if the residents' own error proneness is sufficiently low. Otherwise, the population will be invaded by mutants that commit assessment errors more frequently, and a series of such invasions will eventually undermine the existing social norm. This study suggests that the stability analysis of a social norm may have a different picture if the probability of error itself is regarded as an individual attribute.</description>

      <title>Learning Structured Population Models from Data with WSINDy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of population dynamics, identifying effective model features, such as fecundity and mortality rates, is generally a complex and computationally intensive process, especially when the dynamics are heterogeneous across the population. In this work, we propose a Weak form Scientific Machine Learning-based method for selecting appropriate model ingredients from a library of scientifically feasible functions used to model structured populations. This method uses extensions of the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) method to select the best-fitting ingredients from noisy time-series histogram data. This extension includes learning heterogeneous dynamics and also learning the boundary process of the model directly from the data. We additionally provide a cross-validation method which helps fine tune the recovered boundary process to the data.
  Several test cases are considered, demonstrating the method's performance for different previously studied models, including age and size-structured models. Through these examples, we examine both the advantages and limitations of the method, with a particular focus on the distinguishability of terms in the library.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of epidemic forecasting and spreading on networks with probability generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemic forecasting tools embrace the stochasticity and heterogeneity of disease spread to predict the growth and size of outbreaks. Conceptually, stochasticity and heterogeneity are often modeled as branching processes or as percolation on contact networks. Mathematically, probability generating functions provide a flexible and efficient tool to describe these models and quickly produce forecasts. While their predictions are probabilistic-i.e., distributions of outcome-they depend deterministically on the input distribution of transmission statistics and/or contact structure. Since these inputs can be noisy data or models of high dimension, traditional sensitivity analyses are computationally prohibitive and are therefore rarely used. Here, we use statistical condition estimation to measure the sensitivity of stochastic polynomials representing noisy generating functions. In doing so, we can separate the stochasticity of their forecasts from potential noise in their input. For standard epidemic models, we find that predictions are most sensitive at the critical epidemic threshold (basic reproduction number $R_0 = 1$) only if the transmission is sufficiently homogeneous (dispersion parameter $k &gt; 0.3$). Surprisingly, in heterogeneous systems ($k \leq 0.3$), the sensitivity is highest for values of $R_{0} &gt; 1$. We expect our methods will improve the transparency and applicability of the growing utility of probability generating functions as epidemic forecasting tools.</description>

      <title>Training Flexible Models of Genetic Variant Effects from Functional Annotations using Accelerated Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes -- traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions, potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target identification.</description>
