      <title>Neutrino astronomy at Lake Baikal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High energy neutrino astronomy has seen significant progress in the past few years. This includes the detection of neutrino flux from the Galactic plane, as well as strong evidence for neutrino emission from the active galaxy NGC 1068, both reported by IceCube. New results start coming from the two km$^3$-scale neutrino telescopes under construction in the Northern hemisphere: KM3NeT in the Mediterranean Sea and Baikal-GVD in Lake Baikal. After briefly reviewing the status of the field, we present the current status of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope and its recent results, including observations of atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Impact of propagation effects on the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00232v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical analysis of the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), focusing on the distortions introduced by propagation effects such as scattering and inaccurate de-dispersion. By examining the impact of different scattering timescales and residual dispersion measures (DMs), both independently and in combination, we identify systematic trends in the sub-burst slope law as defined within the framework of the Triggered Relativistic Dynamical Model (TRDM). These effects primarily alter the measurements of the sub-burst slope and duration, thereby also modifying their correlations with other properties, such as central frequency and bandwidth. Our results show that scatter-induced temporal broadening affects duration more than slope, with weak to moderate scattering subtly modifying the sub-burst slope law and strong scattering causing significant deviations. Residual dispersion preferentially modifies the slope, further changing the trends predicted by the sub-burst slope law. Ultra-short bursts (or ultra-FRBs) emerge as particularly susceptible to these effects even at relatively high frequencies, underscoring the need for precise treatment of scattering and accurate dedispersion before performing analyses. Our findings emphasize the necessity for higher frequency observations (especially for ultra-FRBs) to improve the DM estimates as well as the measurements of spectro-temporal properties.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the linearised dispersion relations of shear waves, heat waves, and sound waves in relativistic ''matter+radiation'' fluids with grey absorption opacities. This is done by solving radiation hydrodynamics perturbatively in the ratio ''radiation stress-energy''/''matter stress-energy''. The resulting expressions $\omega \, {=} \, \omega(k)$ accurately describe the hydrodynamic evolution for any $k\, {\in}\, \mathbb{R}$. General features of the dynamics (e.g., covariant stability, propagation speeds, and damping of discontinuities) are argued directly from the analytic form of these dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Observed Steep and Shallow Spectra, Narrow and Broadband Spectra, Multi-frequency Simultaneous Spectra, and Statistical Fringe Spectra in Fast Radio Bursts: Various Faces of Intrinsic Quasi-periodic Spectra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, through analysis, modelings, and simulations, we show that if the spectra of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intrinsically quasi-periodic spectra, likely produced by coherent curvature radiation from quasi-periodic structured bunches, then the observed steep and shallow spectra, narrow and broadband spectra, multi-frequency simultaneous spectra, as well as possible statistical fringe spectra in FRBs, could all be various manifestations of these intrinsically quasi-periodic spectra. If so, the period properties of the structured bunches, as inferred from the observed multi-frequency simultaneous spectra and potential statistical fringe spectra, may provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind the formation of such structured bunches.</description>

      <title>About the accuracy of the relxill/relxill_nk models in view of the next generation of X-ray missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the strong gravity region of black holes. The next generation of astrophysical X-ray missions promises to provide unprecedented high-quality data, which could permit us to get very precise measurements of the properties of the accretion flow and of the spacetime geometry in the strong gravity region around these objects. In this work, we test the accuracy of the relativistic calculations of the reflection model relxill and of its extension to non-Kerr spacetimes relxill_nk in view of the next generation of X-ray missions. We simulate simultaneous observations with Athena/X-IFU and LAD of bright Galactic black holes with a precise and accurate ray-tracing code and we fit the simulated data with the latest versions of relline and relline_nk. While we always recover the correct input parameters, we find residuals in the fits when the emission from the inner part of the accretion disk is higher. Such residuals disappear if we increase the number of interpolation points on the disk in the integral of the transfer function. We also simulate full reflection spectra and find that the emission angle from the accretion disk should be treated properly in this case.</description>

      <title>An Enigmatic PeVatron in an Area around HII Region G35.6$-$0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying Galactic PeVatrons (PeV particle accelerators) from the ultra-high-energy (UHE, &gt;100 TeV) $\gamma$-ray sources plays a crucial role in revealing the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. The UHE source 1LHAASO J1857+0203u is suggested to be associated with HESS J1858+020, which may be attributed to the possible PeVatron candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G35.6$-$0.4 or HII region G35.6$-$0.5. We perform detailed analysis on the very-high-energy and UHE $\gamma$-ray emissions towards this region with data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). 1LHAASO J1857+0203u is detected with a significance of 11.6$\sigma$ above 100 TeV, indicating the presence of a PeVatron. It has an extension of $\sim 0.18^\circ$ with a power-law (PL) spectral index of $\sim$2.5 in 1-25 TeV and a point-like emission with a PL spectral index of $\sim$3.2 above 25 TeV. Using the archival CO and HI data, we identify some molecular and atomic clouds that may be associated with the TeV $\gamma$-ray emissions. Our modelling indicates that the TeV $\gamma$-ray emissions are unlikely to arise from the clouds illuminated by the protons that escaped from SNR G35.6$-$0.4. In the scenario that HII region G35.6$-$0.5 could accelerate particles to the UHE band, the observed GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray emission could be well explained by a hadronic model with a PL spectral index of $\sim$2.0 and cutoff energy of $\sim$450 TeV. However, an evolved pulsar wind nebula origin cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Impact of Sub-MeV Dark Matter on the Cooling of Pulsating White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our galaxy, white dwarfs inevitably undergo scattering and capture processes with the interstellar diffuse dark matter. The captured dark matter forms a dark halo that eventually evaporates or annihilates. Theoretical pulsation modes and observations of pulsating white dwarfs provide predictions about their evolution. This motivates us to study the impact of sub-MeV interstellar dark matter on the cooling processes of white dwarfs. In this work, we consider the collisions between dark matter and relativistic degenerate electrons inside white dwarfs, numerically calculating the energy input and output results from scattering, capture, evaporation, and annihilation processes. Based on observational data from G117-B15, we conclude that the maximum cooling luminosity of the interstellar sub-MeV dark matter is approximately $10^{22} \, \text{erg}/\text{s}$, which is insufficient to provide an effective cooling mechanism for white dwarfs. Finally, if future observations detect a pulsating white dwarf in the Galactic center, the potential sensitivity of this scenario could extend to the region$10^{-3}\,\text{MeV} &lt; m_\chi &lt; 10 \, \text{MeV}$ and $6.02 \times 10^{-38}\,\text{cm}^2 &gt; \sigma_0 \geq 1.5 \times 10^{40} \, \text{cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Maximum Energy of Particles in Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles are accelerated to very high, non-thermal energies in space, solar, and astrophysical plasma environments. In cosmic ray physics, the "Hillas limit" is often used as a rough estimate (or the necessary condition) of the maximum energy of particles. This limit is based on the concepts of one-shot direct acceleration by a system-wide motional electric field, as well as stochastic and diffusive acceleration in strongly turbulent environments. However, it remains unclear how well this limit explains the actual observed maximum energies of particles. Here we show, based on a systematic review, that the observed maximum energy of particles -- those in space, solar, astrophysical, and laboratory environments -- often reach the energy predicted by the Hillas limit. We also found several exceptions, such as electrons in solar flares and jet-terminal lobes of radio galaxies, as well as protons in planetary radiation belts, where deviations from this limit occur. We discuss possible causes of such deviations, and we argue in particular that there is a good chance of detecting ultra-high-energy ($\sim$100 GeV) solar flare electrons that have not yet been detected. We anticipate that this study will facilitate further interdisciplinary discussions on the maximum energy of particles and the underlying mechanisms of particle acceleration in diverse plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Overionized plasma in the supernova remnant Sagittarius A East anchored by XRISM observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sagittarius A East is a supernova remnant with a unique surrounding environment, as it is located in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center, Sagittarius A*. The X-ray emission of the remnant is suspected to show features of overionized plasma, which would require peculiar evolutionary paths. We report on the first observation of Sagittarius A East with X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). Equipped with a combination of high-resolution microcalorimeter spectrometer and large field-of-view CCD imager, we for the first time resolved the Fe XXV K-shell lines into fine structure lines and measured the forbidden-to-resonance intensity ratio to be 1.39+/-0.12, which strongly suggests the presence of overionized plasma. We obtained a reliable constraint on the ionization temperature just before the transition into the overionization state, to be &gt; 4 keV. The recombination timescale was constrained to be &lt; 8e11 cm-3 s. The small velocity dispersion of 109+/-6 km s-1 indicates a low Fe ion temperature &lt; 8 keV and a small expansion velocity &lt; 200 km s-1. The high initial ionization temperature and small recombination timescale suggest that either rapid cooling of the plasma via adiabatic expansion from dense circumstellar material or intense photoionization by Sagittarius A* in the past may have triggered the overionization.</description>

      <title>Numerical approach to compressible shallow-water dynamics of neutron-star spreading layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weakly magnetized neutron star (NS) undergoing disk accretion should release about a half of its power in a compact region known as the accretion boundary layer. Latitudinal spread of the accreted matter and efficient radiative cooling justify the approach to this flow as a two-dimensional spreading layer (SL) on the surface of the star. Numerical simulations of SLs are challenging because of the curved geometry and supersonic nature of the problem. We develop a new two-dimensional hydrodynamics code that uses the multislope second-order MUSCL scheme in combination with an HLLC+ Riemann solver on an arbitrary irregular mesh on a spherical surface. The code is suitable and accurate for Mach numbers at least up to 5-10. Adding sinks and sources to the conserved variables, we simulate constant-rate accretion onto a spherical NS. During the early stages of accretion, heating in the equatorial region triggers convective instability that causes rapid mixing in latitudinal direction. One of the outcomes of the instability is the development of a two-armed `tennis ball' pattern rotating as a rigid body. From the point of view of a high-inclination observer, its contribution to the light curve is seen as a high-quality-factor quasi-periodic oscillation mode with a frequency considerably smaller than the rotation frequency of the matter in the SL. Other variability modes seen in the simulated light curves are probably associated with low-azimuthal-number Rossby waves.</description>

      <title>Broadband study of the Be X-ray binary RX J0520.5-6932 during its outburst in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new giant outburst of the Be X-ray binary RX J0520.5-6932 was detected and subsequently observed with several space-borne and ground-based instruments. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the optical and X-ray data, focusing on the spectral and timing characteristics of selected X-ray observations. A joint fit of spectra from simultaneous observations performed by the X-ray telescope (XRT) on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) provides broadband parameter constraints, including a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at 32.2(+0.8/-0.7) keV with no significant energy change since 2014, and a weaker Fe line. Independent spectral analyses of observations by the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), Einstein Probe (EP), Swift-XRT, and NuSTAR demonstrate the consistency of parameters across different bands. Luminosity variations during the current outburst were tracked. The light curve of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) aligns with the X-ray data in both 2014 and 2024. Spin evolution over 10 years is studied after adding Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) data, improving the orbital parameters, with an estimated orbital period of 24.39 days, slightly differing from OGLE data. Despite intrinsic spin-up during outbursts, a spin-down of ~0.04s over 10.3 years is suggested. For the new outburst, the pulse profiles indicate a complicated energy-dependent shape, with decreases around 15 keV and 25 keV in the pulsed fraction, a first for an extragalactic source. Phase-resolved NuSTAR data indicate variations in parameters such as flux, photon index, and CRSF energy with rotation phase.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array: The $4.5$-year data release and the noise and stochastic signals of the millisecond pulsar population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are ensembles of regularly observed millisecond pulsars timed to high precision. Each pulsar in an array could be affected by a suite of noise processes, most of which are astrophysically motivated. Analysing them carefully can be used to understand these physical processes. However, the primary purpose of these experiments is to detect signals that are common to all pulsars, in particular signals associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background. To detect this, it is paramount to appropriately characterise other signals that may otherwise impact array sensitivity or cause a spurious detection. Here we describe the second data release and first detailed noise analysis of the pulsars in the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array, comprising high-cadence and high-precision observations of $83$ millisecond pulsars over $4.5$ years. We use this analysis to search for a common signal in the data, finding a process with an amplitude of $\log_{10}\mathrm{A_{CURN}} = -14.25^{+0.21}_{-0.36}$ and spectral index $\gamma_\mathrm{CURN} = 3.60^{+1.31}_{-0.89}$. Fixing the spectral index at the value predicted for a background produced by the inspiral of binary supermassive black holes, we measure the amplitude to be $\log_{10}\mathrm{A_{CURN}} = -14.28^{+0.21}_{-0.21}$ at a significance expressed as a Bayes factor of $\ln(\mathcal{B}) = 4.46$. Under both assumptions, the amplitude that we recover is larger than those reported by other PTA experiments. We use the results of this analysis to forecast our sensitivity to a gravitational wave background possessing the spectral properties of the common signal we have measured.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and unsupervised transient classification in high-energy datasets. This approach enabled the discovery of a new fast X-ray transient (FXT) in the Chandra archive, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous breakthroughs in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t Maps and E-t-dt Cubes, designed to capture both temporal and spectral information, effectively addressing the challenges posed by variable-length event file time series in machine learning applications. Our pipeline extracts low-dimensional, informative features from these representations using principal component analysis or sparse autoencoders, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbor searches around known transients, producing a catalog of 3,539 candidates (3,427 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard &lt;10 s initial burst followed by spectral softening in an ~800 s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint LMXB in the LMC. Our method extends to datasets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array: The first search for gravitational waves with the MeerKAT radio telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays search for nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves by regularly observing ensembles of millisecond pulsars over many years to look for correlated timing residuals. Recently the first evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background has been presented by the major Arrays, with varying levels of significance ($\sim$2-4$\sigma$). In this paper we present the results of background searches with the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array. Although of limited duration (4.5 yr), the $\sim$ 250,000 arrival times with a median error of just $3 \mu$s on 83 pulsars make it very sensitive to spatial correlations. Detection of a gravitational wave background requires careful modelling of noise processes to ensure that any correlations represent a fit to the underlying background and not other misspecified processes. Under different assumptions about noise processes we can produce either what appear to be compelling Hellings-Downs correlations of high significance (3-3.4$\sigma$) with a spectrum close to that which is predicted, or surprisingly, under slightly different assumptions, ones that are insignificant. This appears to be related to the fact that many of the highest precision MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array pulsars are in close proximity and dominate the detection statistics. The sky-averaged characteristic strain amplitude of the correlated signal in our most significant model is $h_{c, {\rm yr}} = 7.5^{+0.8}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-15}$ measured at a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.26$, decreasing to $h_{c, {\rm yr}} = 4.8^{+0.8}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-15}$ when assessed at the predicted $\alpha=-2/3$. These data will be valuable as the International Pulsar Timing Array project explores the significance of gravitational wave detections and their dependence on the assumed noise models.</description>

      <title>Long-time 3D supernova simulations of non-rotating progenitors with magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform five 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) core-collapse supernova simulations for non-rotating progenitors between 9.5 $M_\odot$ and 24 $M_\odot$. Four of the five models produce explosions while one fails. The exploding models are extended to between 0.9 s and 1.6 s post-bounce to study a possible impact of magnetic fields on explosion and remnant properties. Diagnostic explosion energies grow at a similar pace as in previous non-magnetic models. They reach between 0.11 foe and 0.61 foe, but are still growing by the end of the simulations. Neutron star kicks reach no more than 300 km s$^{-1}$, and although these are also still growing, they are unlikely to be in conflict with observed pulsar velocities. Extrapolated neutron star spin periods are between 45 ms and 1.8 s, consistent with observed birth spin rates. Magnetic torques only contribute about 10% to the spin-up of the neutron star. The inclusion of magnetic fields does not provide a mechanism for spin-kick alignment in our simulations. Surface dipole fields are in the range of $10^{12}-10^{13}$ G, much smaller than the root-mean-square field strength. Different from previous simulations, magnetic fields in the gain region only reach at most O(1%) of kinetic equipartition, likely because relatively early shock revival cuts off accretion as a power source for field amplification, which appears to be driven primarily by shear flows at the bottom of the gain region.</description>

      <title>Formation Rate of Quasi-periodic Eruptions in Galactic Nuclei Containing Single and Dual Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel class of transients recently discovered in a few extragalactic nuclei. It has been suggested that a QPE can be produced by a main-sequence star undergoing repeated partial disruptions by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) immediately after getting captured on a tightly bound orbit through the Hills mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the period-dependent formation rate of QPEs for this scenario, utilizing scattering experiments and the loss-cone theory. We calculate the QPE formation rates in both a single-SMBH and a dual-SMBHs system, motivated by the over-representation of post-merger galaxies as QPE hosts. We find that for SMBHs of mass $10^{6}-10^{7}M_{\odot}$, most QPEs formed in this scenario have periods longer than $\simeq 100$ days. A single-SMBH system generally produces QPEs at a negligible rate of $10^{-10}-10^{-8}\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$ due to inefficient two-body relaxation. While in a dual-SMBHs system, the QPE rate is enhanced by $3-4$ orders of magnitude, mainly due to a boosted angular momentum evolution under tidal perturbation from the companion SMBH (galaxy). The QPE rate in a post-merger galactic nucleus hosting two equal-mass SMBHs separated by a few parsecs could reach $10^{-6}-10^{-5}\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Our results suggest that a non-negligible fraction ($\simeq 10-90\%$) of long-period QPEs should come from post-merger galaxies.</description>

      <title>Nuclear de-excitation line emissions from giant molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cosmic rays (CRs) propagate within the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is critical for studying the dynamics and chemical processes inside the clouds. The flux of low-energy CRs inside the dense cores of GMCs strongly affects the heating and ionization of the gases and further influences the star-forming process. We analytically calculated the CR distribution inside GMCs assuming different diffusion coefficients, and estimated the corresponding nuclear de-excitation line emission and the ionization rate resulting from the interaction between the penetrating CRs and gases. We find that future MeV observations can be used as a unique probe to measure the low-energy CR density in situ and test different CR propagation scenario inside GMCs.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array: Maps of the gravitational-wave sky with the 4.5 year data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an accompanying publication, the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) collaboration reports tentative evidence for the presence of a stochastic gravitational-wave background, following observations of similar signals from the European and Indian Pulsar Timing Arrays, NANOGrav, the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array. If such a gravitational-wave background signal originates from a population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries, the signal may be anisotropically distributed on the sky. In this Letter we evaluate the anisotropy of the MPTA signal using a spherical harmonic decomposition. We discuss complications arising from the covariance between pulsar pairs and regularisation of the Fisher matrix. Applying our method to the 4.5 yr dataset, we obtain two forms of sky maps for the three most sensitive MPTA frequency bins between 7 -21 nHz. Our "clean maps'' estimate the distribution of gravitational-wave strain power with minimal assumptions. Our radiometer maps answer the question: is there a statistically significant point source? We find a noteworthy hotspot in the 7 nHz clean map with a $p$-factor of $p=0.015$ (not including trial factors). Future observations are required to determine if this hotspot is of astrophysical origin.</description>

      <title>The Subparsec-scale Structure and Evolution of Centaurus A. III. A Multi-Epoch Spectral And Polarimetric VLBA Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Centaurus A radio galaxy, due to its proximity, presents itself as one of the few systems that allow the study of relativistic jet outflows at sub-parsec distances from the central supermassive black holes, with high signal to noise. We present the results from the first multi-epoch spectropolarimetric observations of Centaurus A at milliarcsecond resolution, with a continuous frequency coverage of $4.59-7.78$\,GHz. Using a Bayesian framework, we perform a comprehensive study of the jet kinematics, and discuss aspects of the jet geometry including the jet inclination angle, jet opening angle, and the jet expansion profile. We calculate an upper limit on the jet's inclination to the line of sight to be $&lt;25^{\circ}$, implying the lower limit on the intrinsic jet speed to be $0.2$\,c. On the observed VLBA scales we detect new jet components launched by the central engine since our previous study. Using the observed frequency-dependent core shift in Centaurus A, we find the jet to have reached constant bulk speed and conical outflow at the regions probed by the base of the jet at $7.78- 4.59$\,GHz, and we also estimate the location of the central black hole further upstream. Through polarimetric analysis (by applying RM synthesis for the first time on VLBI data), we find evidence to suggest the possible onset of acceleration towards the leading edge of Centaurus A's subparsec-scale jet studied here.</description>

      <title>Polarization of gamma-ray burst afterglows in the context of non-axisymmetric structured jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the most energetic explosion in the universe, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are usually believed to be generated by relativistic jets. Some mechanisms (e.g. internal non-uniform magnetic dissipation processes or the precession of the central engine) may generate asymmetric jet structures, which is characterized by multiple fluctuations in the light curve of afterglow. Since the jet's structure introduces asymmetry in radiation around the line of sight (LOS), it is naturally expected that polarization will be observable. In this work, we reveal the polarization characteristics of gamma-ray burst afterglows with a non-axisymmetric structured jet. Our results show that the afterglow signal generally exhibits polarization, with the degree and evolution influenced by the specific jet structure, observing frequency, and the line of sight (LOS). The polarization degree is notably higher when the LOS is outside the jet. This degree fluctuates over time as different regions of radiation alternate in their dominance, which is accompanied by the rotation of the polarization angle and further reflects the intricate nature of the jet. Regarding its evolution over frequency, the polarization degree displays significant fluctuations at spectral breaks, with the polarization angle possibly undergoing abrupt changes. These features may provide strong evidence for future identification of potential GRBs with asymmetric jet structures.</description>

      <title>Multiple rebrightenings in the optical afterglow of GRB 210731A: evidence for an asymmetric jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broadband afterglow of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is usually believed to originate from the synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated by the external shock of relativistic jets. Therefore, the jet structure should have a significant impact on the GRB afterglow features. The latest observations indicate that the GRB jets may possess intricate structures, such as Gaussian structure, power-law structure, or jet-cocoon structure. Most recently, an abnormal afterglow of GRB 210731A has raised extensive attention, whose optical afterglow exhibites multiple rebrightening phenomena within 4 hours, posing a serious challenge to the standard afterglow model. Here we intend to interpret the characteristics of GRB 210731A afterglows within the framework of non-axisymmetric structured jets, where multiple distinct peaks in the afterglow light curve are caused by the uneven distribution of energy and velocity within the jet in the azimuth angle direction. Through Monte Carlo Markov Chain fitting, we show that a three-component asymmetric structured jet can well explain the multi-band afterglow data. The energy difference among the three components is about 1.5 orders of magnitude, with higher-energy components exhibiting slower speeds. The radiation contribution of each component has sequentially dominated the light curve of the afterglow, resulting in multiple peaks, with the highest peak occurring at the latest time. We suggest that in the future, polarization observations should be conducted on afterglows with multiple brightening signatures, which will help to effectively distinguish the structured jet model from other alternative models, such as energy injection, and ultimately help to determine the true configuration of jets.</description>

      <title>Marginal Role of the Electrostatic Instability in the GeV-scale Cascade Flux from 1ES 0229+200</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic pair beams produced in the intergalactic medium (IGM) by TeV gamma rays from blazars are expected to generate a detectable GeV-scale electromagnetic cascade, yet this cascade is absent in the observed spectra of hard-spectrum TeV emitting blazars. This suppression is often attributed to weak intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) deflecting electron-positron pairs out of the line of sight. Alternatively, it has been proposed that beam-plasma instabilities could drain the energy of the beam before they produce the secondary cascades. Recent studies suggest that the modification of beam distribution due to these instabilities is primarily driven by particle scattering, rather than energy loss. In this paper, we quantitatively assess, for the blazar 1ES 0229+200, the arrival time of secondary gamma rays at Earth from the beam scattering by the electrostatic instability. We first computed the production rates of electron-positron pairs at various distances using the Monte Carlo simulation CRPropa. We then simulated the feedback of the plasma instability on the beam, incorporating production rates and inverse-Compton cooling, to determine the steady-state distribution function. Our findings reveal that the time delay of the GeV secondary cascade arrival due to instability broadening is on the order of a few months. This delay is insufficient to account for the missing cascade emission in blazar spectra, suggesting that plasma instabilities do not significantly affect IGMF constraints.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from stochastic acceleration in black hole environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from the IceCube detector and their phenomenological interpretation suggest that the corona of nearby X-ray luminous Seyfert galaxies can produce $\sim 1-10\,$TeV neutrinos via photo-hadronic interactions. We investigate in detail the physics of stochastic acceleration in such environments and examine under which conditions one can explain the inferred proton spectrum. To do so, we borrow recent findings on particle acceleration in turbulence and pay particular attention to the transport equation, notably for what concerns transport in momentum space, turbulent transport outside of the corona and advection through the corona. We first remark that the spectra obtained are highly sensitive to the value of the acceleration rate, e.g., to the Alfv\'enic velocity. Then we examine three prototype scenarios, one describing turbulent acceleration in the test-particle picture, one in which particles are pre-accelerated by turbulence and further energized by shear acceleration, and one in which we consider the effect of particle backreaction on the turbulence (damping), which self-regulates the acceleration process. We show that it is possible to obtain satisfactory fits to the inferred proton spectrum in all three cases, but stress that in the first two, the energy content in supra-thermal protons has to be fixed in an ad-hoc manner to match the inferred spectrum, at an energy density close to that contained in the turbulence. Interestingly, self-regulated acceleration by turbulence damping naturally brings the suprathermal particle energy content close to that of the turbulence and allows to reproduce the inferred flux level without additional fine tuning. We suggest that, given the strong sensitivity of the maximal proton energy to the acceleration rate, any variation of that quantity in the corona could affect, and in fact set the slope of the high-energy proton spectrum.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a PRS associated with FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the fourth persistent radio source (PRS) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB). Following previous indications of a candidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A, we performed deep VLBA observations at 5 GHz to test the presence of a compact radio source within the uncertainty position of this FRB ($\pm$200 mas). We detect a component $\sim$50 mas northwards the nominal position provided by the PRECISE collaboration. The corresponding radio luminosity, together with the Faraday rotation measure provided by previous observations of the FRB, locate this PRS in the expected region of the $L$ vs |RM| relation for the nebular model, further supporting it. The comparison of the measured flux density with the respect to the values collected at lower frequency by previous studies, indicates a steepening of the radio spectrum in the 1-3 GHz range and the presence of a possible synchrotron peak at $\sim$1 GHz. Optical observations performed with the LBT could reveal that the FRB and its PRS lie at $\sim$1 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy, which is a dwarf sub-solar metallicity starburst galaxy with SFR $\sim 1 M_\odot\;\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $M\sim10^8 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and the radio perspective on multi-messenger gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic millisecond-duration radio transients whose nature remains unknown. The advent of numerous facilities conducting dedicated FRB searches has dramatically revolutionised the field: hundreds of new bursts have been detected, and some are now known to repeat. Using interferometry, it is now possible to localise FRBs to their host galaxies, opening up new avenues for using FRBs as astrophysical probes. One promising application is studying gravitationally lensed FRBs. This review outlines the requirements for identifying a lensed FRB, taking into account their propagation effects and the importance of capturing the amplitude and phase of the signal. It also explores the different lens masses that could be probed with FRBs throughout the duration of an FRB survey, from stellar masses to individual galaxies. This highlights the unique cosmological applications of gravitationally lensed FRBs, including measurements of the Hubble constant and the compact object content of dark matter. Finally, we discuss future radio interferometers and the prospects for finding gravitationally lensed FRBs.</description>

      <title>Cloudy and the High-Resolution Microcalorimeter Revolution: Optical, UV, and X-ray Spectra of One-electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of the baryonic matter in the universe is in the form of astrophysical plasmas. The mass of the hot X-ray emitting gas in a cluster of galaxies has more mass than the galaxies in the cluster. With the launch of the XRISM microcalorimeter mission, space-based X-ray observations will achieve a record spectral resolving power of $R\equiv E/\Delta E \sim 1200$. With this resolving power, emission features associated with fine-structure energy levels of some species will be resolved, sometimes for the first time. The plasma code, CLOUDY, was not originally designed for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy and throughout its history did not resolve fine-structure components of Lyman lines. Here we expand CLOUDY to resolve these fine-structure energy levels and obtain predicted X-ray spectra that match the resolution of new microcalorimeter observations. We show how the Lyman lines can be used as column density indicators and examine their sensitivity to external radiation fields and turbulence.</description>

      <title>Forced 3D reconnection in an exponentially separating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solvable scenario for 3D reconnection in a sheared magnetic field. We consider a localized external force that is applied slowly and then maintained, generating an Alfv\'{e}nic perturbation that spreads along the field lines. Separation of the sheared field lines causes the scale of the perturbation across the field to decrease, enabling magnetic diffusion to be enhanced. For a fusion-motivated equilibrium with exponential field-line separation, we find a reconnection timescale proportional to $S/\ln S$ under magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and to $S^{1/3}$ for semi-collisional electron-only reconnection, where $S$ is the Lundquist number of the perturbed flux tube. We generalize these results to arbitrary magnetic geometries, showing that the latter is geometry-independent. Interestingly, we find that slower field-line separation yields an increased reconnection rate in MHD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has a public data policy following the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). We aim to share the data with the scientific community as part of the multi-messenger effort at different levels and for educational activities to engage the general public. Following the first portal created in 2007, a new portal hosted at \url{https://opendata.auger.org} was established in February 2021. The portal is regularly updated and comprises 10\% of the recorded cosmic-ray data organized in various datasets, each with a specific DOI provided by Zenodo. Moreover, a catalog with the 100 most energetic events is available. The portal adopts a ``dual'' concept, offering not only the download of public data but also a series of Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks allow the general public to reproduce some of the most important results obtained by the Pierre Auger Collaboration and understand the main mechanisms governing the development of the extensive air showers produced by the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere. In 2023, the Pierre Auger Observatory joined the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG). The successful debut enrolled 550 high-school students at 12 research institutions from 5 countries and was repeated this year, embracing yet more students and countries worldwide. During this day, the participants attend seminars about cosmic rays and are asked to reconstruct subsets of public data events using an Auger 3-D event display. Finally, they participate in a Zoom session with scientists at the Auger site.</description>

      <title>Four years of wide-field search for nanosecond optical transients with the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been previously demonstrated [Panov et al. Physics of Atomic Nuclei 84(2021)1037] that the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array, originally built for cosmic ray physics and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray astronomy studies using the extensive air shower method, can be used in conventional optical astronomy for wide-field searches for rare nanosecond optical transients of astrophysical origin. The FOV of the facility is on the scale of 1~ster, and it is capable of detecting very rare transients in the visible light range with fluxes greater than approximately 3000~quanta/m$^2$/10~ns (10~ns is the apparatus integration time) and pulse durations of 10\,ns. Among the potential sources of distant nanosecond optical transients are the evaporation of primary black holes, magnetic reconnection in the accretion disks of black holes, and signals from distant lasers of extraterrestrial civilizations. The paper describes the methods and results of the search for optical transients using the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array from 2018 to 2022 (four winter seasons of data collection). No reliable astrophysical candidates for optical transients were found. We set an upper bound on the flux of the searched events as $\sim 1\times10^{-3}$\,events/ster/h.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the decay of bosonic dark matter with masses between 1 MeV and 2 TeV into Standard Model final states. We specifically focus on dark photons that kinetically mix with the Standard Model, as well as scalar dark matter models that have Yukawa couplings with the Standard Model. Using INTEGRAL and AMS-02 data, we constrain the dark matter decay lifetime into final states that include photons or positrons, setting strong constraints on the dark matter lifetime that reach 10$^{25}$ s for dark matter below 10 GeV and up to 10$^{29}$ s for dark matter above 10 GeV.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength light curve analysis of the classical nova KT Eri: Optical contribution from a large irradiated accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KT Eri is a classical nova which went into outburst in 2009. Recent photometric analysis in quiescence indicates a relatively longer orbital period of 2.6 days, so that KT Eri could host a very bright accretion disk during the outburst like in the recurrent nova U Sco, the orbital period of which is 1.23 days. We reproduced the optical $V$ light curve as well as the supersoft X-ray light curve of KT Eri in outburst, assuming a large irradiated disk during a nova wind phase of the outburst while a normal size disk after the nova winds stop. This result is consistent with the temporal variation of wide-band $V$ brightness that varies almost with the intermediate-band Str\"omgren $y$ brightness, because the $V$ flux is dominated by continuum radiation, the origin of which is a photospheric emission from the very bright disk. We obtained the white dwarf mass to be $M_{\rm WD}= 1.3\pm0.02 ~M_\odot$, the hydrogen-burning turnoff epoch to be $\sim 240$ days after the outburst, the distance modulus in the $V$ band to be $(m-M)_V=13.4\pm 0.2$, and the distance to KT Eri to be $d=4.2\pm0.4$ kpc for the reddening of $E(B-V)= 0.08$. The peak absolute $V$ brightness is about $M_{V, \rm max}= -8.0$ and the corresponding recurrence time is $\sim 3,000$ yr from its ignition mass together with the mean mass-accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}\sim 1\times 10^{-9} ~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in quiescence. Thus, we suggest that KT Eri is not a recurrent nova.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of microlensed gravitational waves with Conditional Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) provides a unique opportunity to study cosmology and astrophysics at multiple scales. Detecting microlensing signatures, in particular, requires efficient parameter estimation methods due to the high computational cost of traditional Bayesian inference. In this paper we explore the use of deep learning, namely Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), to estimate parameters of microlensed binary black hole (simulated) waveforms. We find that our CVAE model yields accurate parameter estimation and significant computational savings compared to Bayesian methods such as bilby (up to five orders of magnitude faster inferences). Moreover, the incorporation of CVAE-generated priors in bilby reduces the average runtime of the latter in about 48% with no penalty on its accuracy. Our results suggest that a CVAE model is a promising tool for future low-latency searches of lensed signals. Further applications to actual signals and integration with advanced pipelines could help extend the capabilities of GW observatories in detecting microlensing events.</description>

      <title>Charged black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the curvature scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). To construct our solutions, we adopt a linear functional form, $f(R,T) = R + \beta T$. In the limit $\beta = 0$, the theory reduces to General Relativity (GR), recovering $f(R,T) \approx R$. We propose a power-law Lagrangian of the form $\mathcal{L} = f_0 + F + \alpha F^p$, where $\alpha =f_0= 0$ corresponds to the linear electrodynamics case. Using this setup, we derive the metric functions and determine an effective cosmological constant. Our analysis focuses on specific cases with $p = 2$, $p = 4$, and $p = 6$, where we formulate analytic expressions for the matter fields supporting these solutions in terms of the Lagrangian as a function of $F$. Additionally, we verify the regularity of the solutions and study the structure of the event horizons. Furthermore, we examine a more specific scenario by determining the free forms of the first and second derivatives $\mathcal{L}_F(r)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{FF}(r)$ of the Lagrangean of the nonlinear electromagnetic field. From these relations, we derive the general form of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLED}}(r)$ using consistency relations. This Lagrangian exhibits an intrinsic nonlinearity due to the influence of two constants, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Specifically, $\alpha$ originates from the power-law term in the proposed Lagrangian, while $\beta$ arises from the assumed linear function $f(R,T)$. The interplay of these constants ensures that the nonlinearity of the Lagrangian is governed by both $\alpha$ and $\beta$, rather than $\alpha$ alone.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent microscopic calculations for electron captures on nuclei in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculations for electron capture rates on nuclei with atomic numbers between $Z=20$ and $Z=52$ are performed in a self-consistent finite-temperature covariant energy density functional theory within the relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Electron captures on these nuclei contribute most to reducing the electron fraction during the collapse phase of core-collapse supernovae. The rates include contributions from allowed (Gamow-Teller) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions, and it is shown that the latter become dominant at high stellar densities and temperatures. Temperature-dependent effects such as Pauli unblocking and transitions from thermally excited states are also included. The new rates are implemented in a spherically symmetric 1D simulation of the core-collapse phase. The results indicate that the increase in electron capture rates, due to inclusion of FF transitions, leads to reductions of the electron fraction at nuclear saturation density, the peak neutrino luminosity, and enclosed mass at core bounce. The new rates reaffirm that the most relevant nuclei for the deleptonization situate around the $N = 50$ and $82$ shell closures, but compared to previous simulations, nuclei are less proton rich. The new rates developed in this work are available, and will be of benefit to improve the accuracy of multi-dimensional supernova simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study time-like geodesics around a spherically symmetric black hole in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, characterized by the parameter $l$, which induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The geodesic equations and effective potential are derived to investigate the influence of $l$. We calculate the marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, analyzing the parameter's impact. Periodic orbits are computed numerically and classified within the standard taxonomy, revealing significant effects of $l$ on their momentum and energy. Additionally, we explore an extreme mass ratio inspiral system under the adiabatic approximation to derive gravitational waveforms emitted by an object orbiting a supermassive black hole in KR gravity. These waveforms reflect the distinctive characteristics of periodic orbits and highlight the influence of $l$. With advancements in gravitational wave detection, these results offer insights into black holes influenced by Lorentz symmetry-breaking fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photon is one of the promising candidates of light dark matter and could be detected by using its interaction with standard model particles via kinetic mixings. Here, we propose a feasible approach to detect the dark photons by nondestructively probing these mixing-induced quantum state transitions of atomic ensembles. Compared with the scheme by probing the mixing-induced quantum excitation of single-atom detector, the achievable detection sensitivity can be enhanced theoretically by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ for the ensemble containing $N$ atoms. Specifically, we show that the dark photons, in both centimeter- and millimeter-wave bands, could be detected by using the artificial atomic ensemble detector, generated by surface-state electrons on liquid Helium. It is estimated that, with the detectable transition probability of $10^{-4}$, the experimental surface-state electrons (with $N = 10^8$ trapped electrons) might provide a feasible approach to search for the dark photons in $18.61-26.88$ $\mu$eV and $496.28-827.13$ $\mu$eV ranges, within about two months. The confidence level can exceed 95\% for the achievable sensitivities being $10^{-14} \sim 10^{-13}$ and $10^{-12} \sim 10^{-11}$, respectively. In principle, the proposal could also be generalized to the other atomic ensemble detectors for the detection of dark photons in different frequency bands.</description>

      <title>A new way to find symbiotic stars: accretion disc detection with optical survey photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are binaries in which a cool and evolved star of luminosity class I-III accretes onto a smaller companion. However, direct accretion signatures like disc flickering and boundary layer X-rays are typically outshone or suppressed by the luminous giant, shell burning on the accreting white dwarf, and the illuminated wind nebula. We present a new way to find symbiotics that is less biased against directly-detectable accretion discs than methods based on narrow-band H$\alpha$ photometry or objective prism plate surveys. We identified outliers in SkyMapper survey photometry, using reconstructed uvg snapshot colours and rapid variability among the three exposures of each 20-minute SkyMapper Main Survey filter sequence, from a sample of 366,721 luminous red objects. We found that SkyMapper catalog colours of large-amplitude pulsating giants must be corrected for variability, and that flickering is detectable with only three data points. Our methods probed a different region of parameter space than a recent search for accreting-only symbiotics in the GALAH survey, while being surprisingly concordant with another survey's infrared detection algorithm. We discovered 12 new symbiotics, including four with optical accretion disc flickering. Two of the optical flickerers exhibited boundary-layer hard X-rays. We also identified 10 symbiotic candidates, and discovered likely optical flickering in the known symbiotic V1044 Cen (CD-36 8436). We conclude that at least 20% of the true population of symbiotics exhibit detectable optical flickering from the inner accretion disc, the majority of which do not meet the H$\alpha$ detection thresholds used to find symbiotics in typical narrow-band surveys.</description>

      <title>WR + O binaries as probes of the first phase of mass transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet (WR) and O-star binaries can be the progenitors of X-ray binaries and double black hole binaries, yet their formation is not fully understood. For 21 observed WR+O systems we aim to infer \rev{if the mass-transfer started on the main sequence (Case A) or later (Case B). We also calculate (limits on) the mass transfer efficiency $\beta$, i.e. the fraction of transferred mass that is accreted and the parameter $\gamma$ that denotes the fraction of angular momentum of the binary that is lost per unit mass in units of the average angular momentum of the binary per unit mass. We infer the possible values for the initial masses based on the observed WR masses and models for WR from the literature. With these initial primary masses we can create a grid of possible periods and secondary masses for which we can determine the values $\beta$ and $\gamma$ would have taken for either Case A or Case B mass transfer. Based on this we can also determine which case of mass transfer is most likely for each system. Taking into account the progenitor distribution of WR+O binaries we find that highly non-conservative Case A mass transfer seems to be the most likely scenario for the majority of systems as this can explain 14 out of 21 systems. The angular momentum loss is likely relatively high (typically $\gamma &gt; 1$). Our finding that most systems in our sample experienced Case-A mass transfer is at odds with the expectation that most massive binaries go through Case B mass transfer. This suggest post-case-B systems are significantly underrepresented in the observed WR+O binary population, intrinsically or due to severe selection effects.</description>

      <title>On the Orbital Effects of Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei: Tidal Disruption Events and Ejected Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense stellar clusters surround the supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Interactions within the cluster can alter the stellar orbits, occasionally driving a star into the SMBH's tidal radius where it becomes ruptured. This proof-of-concept study examines the orbital effects of stellar collisions using a semianalytic model. Both low and high speed collisions occur in the SMBH's sphere of influence. Our model treats stars in low speed collisions as sticky spheres. For high-speed collisions, we develop a simple prescription based on the limiting case of a hyperbolic encounter. We test a range of collision treatments and cluster conditions. We find that collisions can place stars on nearly radial orbits. Depositing stars within the tidal radius, collisions may drive the disruption of stars with unusual masses and structures: depending on the nature of the collision, the star could be the product of a recent merger, or it could have lost its outer layers in a high speed impact, appearing as a stripped star. We also find that high speed collisions near the periapsis of an eccentric orbit can unbind stars from the SMBH. However, dissipation during these high-speed collisions can substantially reduce the number of unbound stars achieved in our simulations. We conclude that TDEs and ejected stars, even in the hypervelocity regime, are plausible outcomes of stellar collisions, though their frequency in a three-dimensional nuclear star cluster are uncertain. Future work will address the rates and properties of these events.</description>

      <title>Robust detection of hot intragroup medium in optically selected, poor galaxy groups by eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last several decades, extensive research has been conducted on the baryon cycles within cosmic structures, encompassing a broad mass range from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. However, a notable gap in understanding the cosmic baryon cycle is the poor galaxy groups with halo masses around $10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$ (e.g., McGaugh et al. 2010). Poor galaxy groups, like our own Local Group, are prevalent throughout the universe, yet robust detection of their hot, X-ray emitting intragroup medium (IGrM) has remained elusive. The presence of this hot IGrM is crucial for addressing the long-standing "missing baryons" problem. Previous ROSAT-based studies were limited by a small number of X-ray bright samples, thus restricting the scope of their findings. Here we show a robust detection of this hot IGrM in a large, optically selected poor groups sample, based on the stacked X-ray images from the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey. These groups are identified in DESI LS with a mass range of log($M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) = 11.5-13.5 and a redshift range of z = 0.1-0.5. Additionally, our results indicate that despite its presence in virtually groups at all sizes, this gas component is still not sufficient to recover the universal baryon fraction, and hence the "missing baryons" problem still persists in poor galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>A simultaneous explanation of XTE J1814-338 and HESS J1731-347 objects using ${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K^{0}}}$ condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01426</link>

Abstract: The recent observation of the compact star XTE J1814-338 with a mass of $M=1.2^{+0.05}_{-0.05}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km, together with the HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, they provide evidence for the possible presence of exotic matter in the core of neutron stars and significantly enhance our understanding of the equation of state for the dense nuclear matter. In the present srtudy, we investigate the possible existence of neutral anti-kaons and negative charged kaons in neutron stars by employing the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaonic (${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K^{0}}}$) condensates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the XTE J1814-338 object and at the same time the HESS J1731-347 object, using a mixture of kaons condensation in dense nuclear matter. In addition, we compare our analysis approach with the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J1231-1411 pulsars, proposing that to explain all objects simultaneously, it is essential to consider two distinct branches, each corresponding to a different composition of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Emission and detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from highly eccentric orbits of compact binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultra high frequency emission of gravitational waves by binary systems of black holes has recently been investigated in details in the framework of new experimental ideas around resonant cavities. In this article, we consider the case of elliptic trajectories. At fixed masses and frequency, we conclude that the total amount of energy radiated by the system within the bandwidth of the detector can be significantly higher than for circular orbits. However, due to subtle experimental effects, the signal-to-noise ratio is, overall, a decreasing function of the eccentricity. Limits on the maximum distance at which a merging system of black holes can be detected derived for circular orbits are therefore not improved by considering elliptic trajectories. The article is written as pedagogically as possible so as to be accessible to the non-familiar reader.</description>

      <title>Enhanced production of 60Fe in massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are a major source of chemical elements in the cosmos, ejecting freshly produced nuclei through winds and core-collapse supernova explosions into the interstellar medium. Among the material ejected, long lived radioisotopes, such as 60Fe (iron) and 26Al (aluminum), offer unique signs of active nucleosynthesis in our galaxy. There is a long-standing discrepancy between the observed 60Fe/26Al ratio by {\gamma}-ray telescopes and predictions from supernova models. This discrepancy has been attributed to uncertainties in the nuclear reaction networks producing 60Fe, and one reaction in particular, the neutron-capture on 59Fe. Here we present experimental results that provide a strong constraint on this reaction. We use these results to show that the production of 60Fe in massive stars is higher than previously thought, further increasing the discrepancy between observed and predicted 60Fe/26Al ratios. The persisting discrepancy can therefore not be attributed to nuclear uncertainties, and points to issues in massive-star models.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernova progenitors: a contemporary view of a long-standing puzzle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are runaway thermonuclear explosions in white dwarfs that result in the disruption of the white dwarf star, and possibly its nearby stellar companion. SNe Ia occur over an immense range of stellar population age and host galaxy environments, and play a critical role in the nucleosynthesis of intermediate-mass and iron-group elements, primarily the production of nickel, iron, cobalt, chromium, and manganese. Though the nature of their progenitors is still not well-understood, SNe Ia are unique among stellar explosions in that the majority of them exhibit a systematic lightcurve relation: more luminous supernovae dim more slowly over time than less luminous supernovae in optical light (intrinsically brighter SNe Ia have broader lightcurves). This feature, unique to SNe Ia, is rather remarkable and allows their peak luminosities to be determined with fairly high accuracy out to cosmological distances via measurement of their lightcurve decline. Further, studying SNe Ia gives us important insights into binary star evolution physics, since it is widely agreed that the progenitors of SNe Ia are binary (possibly multiple) star systems. In this review, we give a current update on the different proposed Type Ia supernova progenitors, including descriptions of possible binary star configurations, and their explosion mechanisms, from a theoretical perspective. We additionally give a brief overview of the historical (focusing on the more recent) observational work that has helped the astronomical community to understand the nature of the most important distance indicators in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Modeling High Mass X-ray Binaries to Double Neutron Stars through Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present detailed evolutionary simulations of wide binary systems with high-mass ($8-20\,M_{\odot}$) donor stars and a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star. Mass transfer in such binaries is dynamically unstable and common envelope (CE) evolution is followed. We use a recently developed prescription to deal with CE evolution and consider various CE ejection efficiencies varying in the range of $0.1-3.0$. We focus on the evolutionary consequences of the binaries survived CE evolution. We demonstrate that it is possible for the binaries to enter a CE decoupling phase (CEDP) when the donor stars are partially stripped leaving a hydrogen envelope of $\lesssim1.0-4.0\,M_\odot$ after CE evolution. This phase is expected to last $\sim 10^4-10^5\,\rm yr$, during which mass transfer occurs stably via Roche lobe overflow with super-Eddington rates. Identification of some X-ray binaries in a CEDP is important for the understanding of the physics of CE evolution itself, the origin of ultraluminous X-ray sources, and the recycling process of accreting pulsars. Also, we discuss the formation of double neutron stars and the occurrence of ultra-stripped supernovae according to the results from our simulations. On the whole, the properties of post-CE binaries are sensitive to the options of CE ejection efficiencies.</description>

      <title>The Newly Discovered Nova Super-Remnant Surrounding Recurrent Nova T Coronae Borealis: Will it Light Up During the Coming Eruption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A century or less separates the thermonuclear-powered eruptions of recurrent novae in the hydrogen-rich envelopes of massive white dwarfs. The colliding ejecta of successive recurrent nova events are predicted to always generate very large (tens of parsecs) super-remnants; only two examples are currently known. T CrB offers an excellent opportunity to test this prediction. As it will almost certainly undergo its next, once-in ~80-year recurrent nova event between 2024 and 2026, we carried out very deep narrowband and continuum imaging to search for the predicted, piled-up ejecta of the past millenia. While nothing is detected in continuum or narrowband [OIII] images, a ~30-parsec-diameter, faint nebulosity surrounding T CrB is clearly present in deep Halpha, [NII] and [SII] narrowband Condor Array Telescope imagery. We predict that these newly detected nebulosities, as well as the recent ejecta that have not yet reached the super-remnant, are far too optically-thin to capture all but a tiny fraction of the photons emitted by RN flashes. We thus predict that fluorescent light echoes will NOT be detectable following the imminent nova flash of T CrB. Dust may be released by the T CrB red giant wind in pre-eruption outbursts, but we have no reliable estimates of its quantity or geometrical distribution. While we cannot predict the morphology or intensity of dust-induced continuum light echoes following the coming flash, we encourage multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging as well as James Webb Space Telescope infrared imaging of T CrB during the year after it erupts.</description>

Abstract: Our latest paper investigates the effects of UHECR propagation in a turbulent intergalactic magnetic field in the small-angle scattering regime, specifically focusing on the non-trivial caustic-like pattern that arises with strong deviation from isotropy. In this paper, we explore the effect of the observer's position on the measurement of source flux at a given distance. We examine three types of source locations, characterized by the density of cosmic rays from a given source at the observation point, which we call knots, filaments and voids. We also investigate the energy spectrum in these different cases and present simulated images of the source as it appears on the observer's telescope after propagation in the combination of intergalactic and Galactic magnetic fields. We show that hot spots in the UHECR data can arrive due to combined distortions of source images on the intergalactic and Galactic magnetic fields. Also the fact that flux of most nearby sources is diluted in the voids affects source population studies.</description>

      <title>SN 1054 as a Pulsar-Driven Supernova: Implications for the Crab Pulsar and Remnant Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most studied objects in astronomy, the Crab Nebula, is the remnant of the historical supernova SN 1054. Historical observations of the supernova imply a typical supernova luminosity, but contemporary observations of the remnant imply a low explosion energy and low ejecta kinetic energy. These observations are incompatible with a standard $^{56}$Ni-powered supernova, hinting at an an alternate power source such as circumstellar interaction or a central engine. We examine SN 1054 using a pulsar-driven supernova model, similar to those used for superluminous supernovae. The model can reproduce the luminosity and velocity of SN 1054 for an initial spin period of $\sim$ 14 ms and an initial dipole magnetic field of 10$^{14-15}$ G. We discuss the implications of these results, including the evolution of the Crab pulsar, the evolution of the remnant structure, formation of filaments, and limits on freely expanding ejecta. We discuss how our model could be tested further through potential light echo photometry and spectroscopy, as well as the modern analogues of SN 1054.</description>

      <title>Dilaton generation in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in a galactic magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is devoted to dilaton generation in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in a galactic magnetic field. It is shown that in this process it's necessary to take into account the presence of a reflective index of matter distributed in the galaxy. According to obtained estimates influence of the gravitational field of pulsars and magnetars on radiation of magnetic dipole waves is negligible and tends to a small change of their amplitude, near about 1 per cent. That's why in this study one can neglect the impact of gravitational field on process of dilaton generation.
  Exact solution of the dilaton equation is found and angular distribution of dilaton radiation is obtained in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in galactic magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most powerful explosive events in the universe. LHAASO recently observed the most luminous one: GRB 221009A, and unveiled its TeV light curve. The light curve exhibits a distinct jet break at around 670 seconds, enabling the derivation of the viewing angle based on the smoothness of the jet break. We constructed two models with or without considering the high-latitude radiation, where the viewing angle was treated as a free parameter, to fit the TeV light curve. We obtained the viewing angles being 9.4 $\times 10^{-4}$ radians and 5.9 $\times 10^{-3}$ radians, respectively. These values closely resemble an on-axis scenario, given the opening angle is 1.4 $\times 10^{-2}$ radians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron break frequencies of mildly-to-highly relativistic outflows observed off-axis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the synchrotron spectrum produced by mildly-to-highly relativistic collisionless shocks. Simple analytic formulae are derived for the break frequencies (peak frequency, self-absorption frequency, synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling frequencies) of the emission produced by post-shock plasma elements propagating at an angle $\theta_e$ relative to the observer's line of sight. These formulae reproduce well the results of earlier exact analytic calculations valid for ultra-relativistic shocks and also hold for $\gamma&lt;10$ and for "off-axis" propagation (deviating from the ultra-relativistic results by approximately an order of magnitude). Our results will improve parameter estimation accuracy from future observations of synchrotron emission produced by collisionless shocks driven by the relativistic ejected material from compact objects mergers and jetted tidal disruption events. The improved accuracy for mildly relativistic velocities is essential since most events will be observed off-axis, with $\gamma&lt;10$ outflows dominating the synchrotron emission (due to relativistic beaming). For GW170817, our results imply that (i) the Lorentz factor of the plasma emitting the observed radiation is bounded by $2.6&lt;\gamma$ at $t\sim10$ days and by $\gamma&lt;12$ at $t&gt;16$ days, (ii) the interstellar medium (ISM) density, $n$, and the fraction of internal energy density held by magnetic fields, $\varepsilon_B$, are bounded by $n\cdot\varepsilon_B\lesssim 3\times10^{-7}$cm$^{-3}$. In future merger events in higher-density ISM, the peak and cooling frequencies may be identified in the radio and X-ray bands; consequently, $\gamma,n\cdot\varepsilon_B$ could be measured as opposed to the case of GW170817, where these frequencies are out of the observable range.</description>

      <title>HOLESOM: Constraining the Properties of Slowly-Accreting Massive Black Holes with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting massive black holes (MBHs, with M$_\bullet &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) are known for their panchromatic emission, spanning from radio to gamma rays. While MBHs accreting at significant fractions of their Eddington rate are readily detectable, those accreting at much lower rates in radiatively inefficient modes often go unnoticed, blending in with other astrophysical sources. This challenge is particularly relevant for gas-starved MBHs in external galaxies and those possibly wandering in the Milky Way. We present HOLESOM, a machine learning-powered tool based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm, specifically designed to identify slowly-accreting MBHs using sparse photometric data. Trained on a comprehensive set of $\sim$ 20, 000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs), HOLESOM can (i) determine if the photometry of a source is consistent with slowly-accreting MBHs and (ii) estimate its black hole mass and Eddington ratio, including uncertainties. We validate HOLESOM through extensive tests on synthetic data and real-world cases, including Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying slowly-accreting MBHs. Additionally, we derive analytical relations between radio and X-ray luminosities to further constrain physical parameters. The primary strength of HOLESOM lies in its ability to accurately identify MBH candidates, which can then be targeted for follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. Fast and scalable, HOLESOM offers a robust framework for automatically scanning large multi-wavelength datasets, making it a valuable tool for unveiling hidden MBH populations in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>The apparent and cosmic rates of short gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), GRB~170817A, is often considered a rare event. However, its inferred event rate, $\mathcal{O}(100s)\ \text{Gpc}^{-3}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$, exceeds cosmic sGRB rate estimates from high-redshift samples by an order of magnitude. This discrepancy can be explained by geometric effects related to the structure of the relativistic jet. We first illustrate how adopting a detector flux threshold point estimate rather than an efficiency function, can lead to a large variation in rate estimates. Simulating the Fermi-GBM sGRB detection efficiency, we then show that for a given a universal structured jet profile, one can model a geometric bias with redshift. Assuming different jet profiles, we show a geometrically scaled rate of GRB~170817A is consistent with the cosmic beaming uncorrected rate estimates of short $\gamma$-ray bursts (sGRBs) and that geometry can boost observational rates within $\mathcal{O}(100s)$\,Mpc. We find an apparent GRB~170817A rate of $303_{-300}^{+1580}$ $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1} $ which when corrected for geometry yields $6.15_{-6.06}^{+31.2}$ $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1} $ and $3.34_{-3.29}^{+16.7}$ $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1} $ for two different jet profiles, consistent with pre-2017 estimates of the isotropic sGRB rate. Our study shows how jet structure can impact rate estimations and could allow one to test structured jet profiles. We finally show that modelling the maximum structured jet viewing angle with redshift can transform a cosmic beaming uncorrected rate to a representative estimate of the binary neutron star merger rate. We suggest this framework can be used to demonstrate parity with merger rates or to yield estimates of the successful jet fraction of sGRBs.</description>

      <title>Constraining black hole parameters with the precessing jet nozzle of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Cui et al. [Nature \textbf{621}, 711 (2023)] reported that the jet nozzle of M87* exhibits a precession with a period of approximately 11 years. This finding strongly suggests that the supermassive black hole in the core of M87 galaxy is a spinning black hole with a tilted accretion disk. In this paper, our aim is to utilize these observations to preliminarily constrain the parameters of the black hole by using the characteristics of the geodesic motion. Firstly, we investigate the properties of the spherical orbits and the innermost stable spherical orbits with constant radius. The corresponding angular momentum, energy, and Carter constant for both prograde and retrograde orbits are calculated. We find that, compared to equatorial circular orbits, these quantities exhibit significant differences for fixed tilt angles. Moreover, the Carter constant takes positive values for nonvanishing tilt angles. Notably, the presence of misalignment of the orbit angular momentum and black hole spin leads to a precession effect in these spherical orbits. We then make use of these spherical orbits to model the warp radius of the tilted accretion disk, which allows us to determine the corresponding precession period through the motion of massive particles. Further comparing with the observation of M87*, the relationship between the black hole spin and the warp radius is given, through which if one of them is tested, the other one will be effectively determined. Additionally, our study establishes an upper bound on the warp radius of the accretion disk. These findings demonstrate that the precession of the jet nozzle offers a promising approach for testing the physics of strong gravitational regions near a supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Toward a test of Gaussianity of a gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree of Gaussianity of a field offers insights into its cosmological nature, and its statistical properties serve as indicators of its Gaussianity. In this work, we examine the signatures of Gaussianity in a gravitational wave background (GWB) by analyzing the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions of the relevant observable, using pulsar timing array (PTA) simulations as a proof-of-principle. This appeals to the ongoing debate about the source of the spatially-correlated common-spectrum process observed in PTAs, which is likely associated with a nanohertz stochastic GWB. We investigate the distribution of the sample statistics of the one-point function in the presence of a Gaussian GWB. Our results indicate that, within PTAs, one-point statistics are impractical for constraining the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB due to dominant pulsar noises. However, our analysis of two-point statistics shows promise, suggesting that it may be possible to constrain the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB using PTA data. We also emphasize that the Gaussian signatures identified in the one- and two-point functions in this work are expected to be applicable to any gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Configurational entropy and stability conditions of fermion and boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a remarkable study by M. Gleiser and N. Jiang [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 92}, 044046, 2015], the authors demonstrated that the stability regions of neutron stars, within the framework of the simple Fermi gas model, and self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar field (boson stars) with various self couplings, obtained through traditional perturbation methods, correlate with critical points of the configurational entropy with an accuracy of a few percent. Recently, P. Koliogiannis \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 044069 2023] found that while the minimization of the configurational entropy generally anticipates qualitatively the stability point for neutron stars and quark stars, this approach lacks universal validity. In this work, we aim to further elucidate this issue by seeking to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, we calculate the configurational entropy of bosonic and fermionic systems, described by interacting Fermi and boson gases, respectively, that form compact objects stabilized by gravity. We investigate whether the minimization of configurational entropy coincides with the stability point of the corresponding compact objects. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the stability points predicted by configurational entropy and those obtained through traditional methods, with the accuracy of this correlation showing a slight dependence on the interaction strength. Consequently, the stability of compact objects, composed of components obeying Fermi or boson statistics, can alternatively be assessed using the concept of configurational entropy.</description>

      <title>Morphology and Mach Number Distribution of Merger Shock Surfaces in Merging Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a binary merger of two subclusters with comparable masses, a pair of merger shocks are typically generated, often manifesting as double radio relics. Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we identify major merger events with mass ratio $\mathcal{M}_1/\mathcal{M}_2\lesssim4$ and impact parameter $b/r_{\rm vir,1}\lesssim1$, where $r_{\rm vir,1}$ is the virial radius of the larger subcluster. We analyze merger shock surfaces approximately 1 Gyr after the pericenter passage, focusing on their morphology and the distribution of the Mach number, $M_s$, of their constituent shock zones. The shock surfaces exhibit an elongated shape with a minor-to-major axis ratio of $\sim0.6-0.9$ and cover the area of $\sim5-20\%$ of the enclosed sphere. The area ratio of the two shock surfaces roughly scales with $\mathcal{M}_1/\mathcal{M}_2$, typically positioning the larger shock ahead of the smaller subcluster. The axis connecting the two subclusters generally does not pass through the centers of the shock surfaces, due to the nonzero impact parameter and the turbulent flows around them. The distribution of $M_s$ of shock zones on each surface can be approximated by a log-normal function, peaking at $M_{s,\rm{peak}}\approx2-4.5$ and extending up to $\sim10$. The surface-area-weighted and X-ray-emissivity-weighted average Mach numbers are comparable, with ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{\rm{area}}\approx2.3-4.4$ and ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{X}\approx2-4$. In contrast, the cosmic-ray-energy-flux-weighted average Mach numbers are higher with ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{\rm{CR}}\approx3-5$. This discrepancy aligns with the differences between Mach numbers derived from X-ray and radio observations of radio relic shocks. On the other hand, we find that mostly ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{X}\gtrsim2$ for simulated merger shocks, although shocks with $M_{\rm X-ray}\lesssim2$ are often reported in observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining the progenitor of the nearby Type II-P SN 2024ggi with environmental analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SN) have been confirmed to be red supergiants. However, the upper mass limit of the directly probed progenitors is much lower than that predicted by current theories, and the accurate determination of the progenitor masses is key to understand the final fate of massive stars. Located at a distance of only 6.72 Mpc, the Type II-P SN 2024ggi is one of the closest SN in the last decade. Previous studies have analyzed its progenitor by direct detection, but the derived progenitor mass may be influenced by the very uncertain circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability. In this work, we try to constrain the progenitor mass with an environmental analysis based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We found that stars in the progenitor environment have a uniform spatial distribution without significant clumpiness, and we derived the star formation history of the environment with a hierarchical Bayesian method. The progenitor is associated with the youngest population in the SN environment with an age of log($t$/yr) = 7.41 (i.e. 25.7 Myr), which corresponds to an initial mass of $10.2^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ $M_\odot$. Our work provides an independent measurement of the progenitor mass, which is not affected by circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability.</description>

      <title>The perils of stacking optically selected groups in eROSITA data. The Magneticum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulation predictions are often compared with observational data without fully accounting for systematics and biases specific to observational techniques. Using the magnetohydrodynamical simulation Magneticum, we generate mock eROSITA eRASS:4 data, combined with GAMA-like spectroscopic surveys and optically selected galaxy catalogs from the same light-cone, to analyze hot gas properties in galaxy groups via a stacking technique. This study aims to (i) incorporate observational systematics into predictions and (ii) evaluate the reliability of stacking techniques for determining average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Our analysis provides X-ray emission predictions from Magneticum, including contributions from AGN, X-ray binaries (XRBs), and the Intra-Group Medium (IGM) as a function of halo mass, covering Milky Way (MW)-like groups to poor clusters. We find that AGN and XRBs dominate the X-ray surface brightness profiles of low-mass halos. The reliability of stacking techniques is tested by reproducing input X-ray surface brightness and electron density profiles, accounting for completeness and contamination of prior samples, miscentering of optical group centers, uncertainties in X-ray emissivity due to gas temperature and metallicity assumption, and systematics in halo mass proxies. The halo mass proxy emerges as the primary source of systematics, affecting X-ray surface brightness and scaling relations. We show that stacked X-ray luminosity-mass relations are flatter than input relations but consistent with observations. Additionally, the retrieved hot gas fraction-mass relation aligns well with observational data. These results highlight the need to account for systematic errors when comparing stacking techniques to other methods using different prior catalogs or predictions.</description>

      <title>The hot gas mass fraction in halos. From Milky Way-like groups to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using eROSITA data in the eFEDS area, we provide a measure of the hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation over the largest halo mass range, from Milky Way-sized halos to massive clusters, and to the largest radii ever probed so far in local systems. To cope with the incompleteness and selection biases of the X-ray selection, we apply the stacking technique in eROSITA data of a highly complete and tested sample of optically selected groups. The method has been extensively tested on mock observations. In massive clusters, the hot gas alone provides a baryon budget within $R_{200}$ consistent with the cosmic value. At the same time, at the group mass scale, it accounts only for 20-40% of it. The hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation is well-fitted by a power law, with a consistent shape and a normalization varying at maximum by a factor of 2 from $r_{500}$ to $r_{200}$. Such a relation is consistent with other works in the literature that consider X-ray survey data at the same depth as eFEDS. However, it provides a lower average gas fraction in the group regime than works based on X-ray bright group samples. The comparison of the observed relation with the predictions of several hydrodynamical simulations (BAHAMAS, FLAMINGO, SIMBA, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, and Magneticum) shows that all simulations but Magneticum and SIMBA overpredict the gas fraction, with the largest discrepancy (up to a factor of 3) in the massive group-poor cluster halo mass range. We emphasize the need for mechanisms that can effectively expel gas to larger radii in galaxy groups without excessively quenching star formation in their member galaxies. Current hydrodynamical simulations face a significant challenge in balancing their subgrid physics: none can sufficiently evacuate gas from the halo virial region without negatively impacting the properties of the resident galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. From Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17120</link>

Abstract: This study examines the average X-ray properties of massive halos at z&lt; 0.2, covering the largest halo mass range to date, from Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters. The analysis is based on stacking in the eFEDS area of the GAMA galaxy group sample, validated with synthetic data that mimic observed eROSITA X-ray and GAMA optical data using Magneticum lightcones. Stacking was conducted in halo mass bins and tested for AGN and X-ray binary contamination, systematics in the halo mass proxy, and uncertainties in optical group centers. The study provides average X-ray surface brightness profiles in six mass bins, spanning Milky Way-like systems to poor clusters. The scatter in the X-ray luminosity-mass (LX-M) relation is attributed to gas concentration: low X-ray luminosity systems at fixed halo mass exhibit lower central gas concentrations than high-luminosity systems, consistent with Magneticum predictions. However, discrepancies in dark matter concentration arise, with Magneticum predicting undetected groups as older and more relaxed, while observations suggest the opposite. New LX-M relations are presented covering three decades of halo mass. These relations fit a single power law, aligning with previous studies. Magneticum matches observed gas distributions across all masses, whereas IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, Simba, and FLAMINGO exhibit significant discrepancies at various mass scales. Simulations calibrated on local galaxy properties accurately reproduce central galaxies but fail to capture gas properties. Conversely, simulations like Magneticum excel in gas predictions but produce overly massive central galaxies. Further exploration of gas and dark matter distributions and their effects on galaxy properties is critical to comprehending the role of gravitational forces and feedback in shaping large-scale structure and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>No evidence for fast, galaxy-wide ionised outflows in a nearby quasar -- the importance of accounting for beam smearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To test the scenario that outflows accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a major impact on galaxy-wide scales, we have analysed deep VLT/MUSE data for the type-2 quasar/ultraluminous infrared galaxy F13451+1232 - an object that represents the major mergers considered in models of galaxy evolution. After carefully accounting for the effects of atmospheric seeing that had smeared the emission from known compact nuclear outflows across the MUSE field of view, we find that the large-scale kinematics in F13451+1232 are consistent with gravitational motions that are expected in a galaxy merger. Therefore, the fast ($\mathrm{W_{80}}&gt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows in this object are limited to the central $\sim$100 pc of the galaxy, although we cannot rule out larger-scale, lower-velocity outflows. Moreover, we directly demonstrate that failure to account for the beam-smearing effects of atmospheric seeing would have led to the mass outflow rates and kinetic powers of spatially-extended emission being overestimated by orders of magnitude. We also show that beam-smeared compact-outflow emission can be significant beyond radial distances of 3.5 arcseconds (more than eight times the radius of the seeing disk), and support the argument that some previous claims of large-scale outflows in active galaxies were likely the result of this effect rather than genuine galaxy-wide ($r&gt;5$ kpc) outflows. Our study therefore provides further evidence that warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows are limited to the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and highlights the critical importance of accounting for atmospheric seeing in ground-based observational studies of active galaxies.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs is uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. In this work, we analyze WOH G64, considered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series photometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from semi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy confirms the transition, as WOH~G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in the optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic system formed by a RSG, which transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant, and a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be explained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the return of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind phase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH~G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>A gravitational wave detectable candidate Type Ia supernova progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.</description>
