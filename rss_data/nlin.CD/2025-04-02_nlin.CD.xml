      <title>WavKinS.jl : an efficient and modular Julia software for solving wave kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes the Wave Kinetic Solver \WavKinSns, a software developed in the Julia language for solving different types of wave kinetic equations in an efficient and modular manner. \WavKinS already solves the wave kinetic equation describing the interaction of waves in several physical systems, such as acoustic waves, Bose-Einstein condensates, internal gravity waves and many others. Thanks to the structures and routines already implemented in \WavKinSns, we expect that developing a new solver for a specific physical system to be straightforward. \WavKinS is an Open Source project distributed with EUPL-1.2 license agreement.</description>

      <title>Chaos and noise in evolutionary game dynamics</title>

Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has traditionally employed deterministic models to describe population dynamics. These models, due to their inherent nonlinearities, can exhibit deterministic chaos, where population fluctuations follow complex, aperiodic patterns. Recently, the focus has shifted towards stochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems with constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with chaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory. This study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth and death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show that despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic dynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its stochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the deterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where the term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear dynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We observe that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing deterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the dynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience to demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations, even in non-equilibrium dynamics. Overall, our results broaden our understanding of population dynamics, and revisit the boundaries between chaos and noise, showing how they maintain structure when considering finite populations in systems that are chaotic in the deterministic limit.</description>

      <title>Chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.02017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence plays a very important role in determining the transport of energy and particles in fusion plasmas. This work is devoted to studying the chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence in the context of the nonlinear wave-particle interaction. Turbulent waves with characteristic wavelengths at different scales can interact with the same group of charged particles when the waves' phase velocities are close to the velocities of the charged particles. A multi-wavenumber standard mapping is developed to model the chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence. The diffusion coefficient is obtained by calculating the correlation functions analytically. For our purposes, the wave intensities of all the turbulent waves are of the same order. It is found that the contribution of the largest scale components dominates the deviation from the quasi-linear (QL) diffusion coefficient. Just decreasing the interwave spacing of the wave phase velocity of the smaller scale components (the turbulent waves with characteristic wavelengths at smaller scale) to realize strongly resonant overlap cannot make the diffusion coefficient approach the QL diffusion limit for a given finite wave amplitude. The diffusion coefficient may deviate from the QL one when larger-scale components are added to a very chaotic system driven by smaller-scale components. In particular, for the two-scale case, the diffusion coefficient is mostly over the QL diffusion coefficient as the wave intensity increases in the limit of zero interwave spacing for the smaller scale components. As more scales of wavelengths are included, the diffusion coefficient approaches the QL diffusion coefficient. The results can give new insight into other resonance-induced multi-scale turbulence in Hamiltonian systems with 1.5 or 2 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Modal interactions between a linear oscillator and a nonlinear absorber: multiscale energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considerable attention has been given to the use of a nonlinear energy sink (NES) as a nonlinear absorber. The NES is an efficient passive control device, which has been the focus of extensive research. This paper uses the Complexification-Averaging/Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (CX-A/GSPT) to investigate the multiscale energy transfers in a forced two-DOF system coupled to a grounded NES (GNES) with both nonlinear grounded stiffness and damping. Due to the coexistence of fundamental resonance and internal resonance in the system, complex modal interactions occur between the linear oscillator (LO) and the GNES. In addition, the ratio of the mass of the GNES and the LO can be seen as a perturbation. This may lead to the occurrence of multiscale dynamics and energy transfers in the system. By using the CX-A method, the slow flow equations of the system can be obtained. Further application of GSPT can obtain the critical manifold that is equivalent to the so-called slow invariant manifold (SIM). With different values of nonlinear grounded stiffness and damping, the critical manifolds have different structures. These critical manifolds can capture diverse types of system responses. Moreover, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is used to analyze the time-frequency-energy relationship of system response. With different parameters, the instantaneous frequencies of the responses of the LO and GNES show a completely different change. The Hilbert spectrums confirm the occurrence of complex modal interactions and different time-scale energy transfers in the system.</description>
