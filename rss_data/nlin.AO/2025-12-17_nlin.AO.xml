      <title>From bipedal to chaotic motion of chemically fueled partially wetting liquid drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a thermodynamically consistent out-of-equilibrium continuum model to study the motion patterns of partially wetting liquid drops covered by autocatalytically reacting surfactants. When ambient chemostats feed a chemomechanical feedback loop involving a nonlinear reaction network, surface stresses caused by the Marangoni effect and the ensuing hydrodynamic motion, drops show a variety of increasingly complex biomimetic motility modes including shuttling, bipedal, rotational, intermittently chaotic and chaotic motion. We determine the corresponding nonequilibrium phase diagram and show that the complexity of the motion arises from competing length scales.</description>

      <title>Equitability and explosive synchronisation in multiplex and higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cluster synchronisation is a key phenomenon observed in networks of coupled dynamical units. Its presence has been linked to symmetry and, more generally, to equability of the underlying pattern of interactions between dynamical units. However, it is not known under which conditions equitability-induced synchronisation is the only cluster synchronisation that can occur on a particular system. Here, we reveal a natural linear independent condition such that equitability becomes necessary, and sufficient, for the existence of cluster synchronised solutions on a very general dynamical system which allows multiplex or higher-order, arbitrarily weighted interactions. Our results explain the ubiquity of explosive synchronisation, as opposed to cluster synchronisation, in multiplex and higher-order networks: equitability imposes additional constraints that must be simultaneously satisfied on the same set of nodes. Our results have significant implications for the design of complex dynamical systems of coupled dynamical units with arbitrary cluster synchronisation patterns and coupling functions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multistability and Hysteresis in Urban Congestion Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the macroscopic functional states of urban road networks exhibit multistability and hysteresis, but microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that in real-world road networks, the recovery process of congested roads is not spontaneous, as assumed in existing models, but is hindered by connected congested roads, and such hindered recovery can lead to the emergence of multistability and hysteresis in urban traffic dynamics. By analyzing real-world urban traffic data, we observed that congestion propagation between individual roads is well described by a simple contagion process like an epidemic, but the recovery rate of a congested road decreases drastically by the congestion of the adjacent roads unlike an epidemic. Based on this microscopic observation, we proposed a simple model of congestion propagation and dissipation, and found that our model shows a discontinuous phase transition between macroscopic functional states of road networks when the recovery hindrance is strong enough through a mean-field approach and numerical simulations. Our findings shed light on an overlooked role of recovery processes in the collective dynamics of failures in networked systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Forcing of the Collisional Auroral Ionosphere by Kinetic Alfv\'en Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of the auroral ionosphere is ascribed to local plasma instabilities. However, we report turbulence extending below 90 km altitude, where particle collisions act to stabilize the plasma. Using a composite radar-GPS spectrum, we resolve a scale-invariant cascade in the 80 km-120 km altitude layer. We identify a characteristic kinetic Alfv\'enic k^{-8/3} scaling, spanning four orders of magnitude in k, that tracks precipitating energy flux. This reveals a chemical and electric imprint of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, seeding and driving local instability processes.</description>

      <title>Self-organisation -- the underlying principle and a general model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Developmental Symmetry-Loss: A Free-Energy Perspective on Brain-Inspired Invariance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Symmetry-Loss, a brain-inspired algorithmic principle that enforces invariance and equivariance through a differentiable constraint derived from environmental symmetries. The framework models learning as the iterative refinement of an effective symmetry group, paralleling developmental processes in which cortical representations align with the world's structure. By minimizing structural surprise, i.e. deviations from symmetry consistency, Symmetry-Loss operationalizes a Free-Energy--like objective for representation learning. This formulation bridges predictive-coding and group-theoretic perspectives, showing how efficient, stable, and compositional representations can emerge from symmetry-based self-organization. The result is a general computational mechanism linking developmental learning in the brain with principled representation learning in artificial systems.</description>
