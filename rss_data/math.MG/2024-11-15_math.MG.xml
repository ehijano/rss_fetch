      <title>Reverse isoperimetric properties of thick $\lambda$-sausages in the hyperbolic plane and Blaschke's rolling theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the reverse isoperimetric inequality for convex bodies with uniform curvature constraints in the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. We prove that thethick $\lambda$-sausage body, that is, the convex domain bounded by two equal circular arcs of curvature $\lambda$ and two equal arcs of hypercircle of curvature $1 / \lambda$, is the unique minimizer of area among all bodies $K \subset \mathbb{H}^2$ with a given length and with curvature of $\partial K$ satisfying $1 / \lambda \leq \kappa \leq \lambda$ (in a weak sense). We call this class of bodies thick $\lambda$-concave bodies, in analogy to the Euclidean case where a body is $\lambda$-concave if $0 \leq \kappa \leq \lambda$. The main difficulty in the hyperbolic setting is that the inner parallel bodies of a convex body are not necessarily convex. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an extra assumption of thickness $\kappa \geq 1/\lambda$. In addition, we prove the Blaschke's rolling theorem for $\lambda$-concave bodies under the thickness assumption. That is, we prove that a ball of curvature $\lambda$ can roll freely inside a thick $\lambda$-concave body. In striking contrast to the Euclidean setting, Blaschke's rolling theorem for $\lambda$-concave domains in $\mathbb{H}^2$ does not hold in general, and thus has not been studied in literature before. We address this gap, and show that the thickness assumption is necessary and sufficient for such a theorem to hold.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounding the Gromov--Hausdorff distance in Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact, connected metric graph and let $X\subseteq G$ be a subset. If $X$ is sufficiently dense in $G$, we show that the Gromov--Hausdorff distance matches the Hausdorff distance, namely $d_{GH}(G,X)=d_{H}(G,X)$. In a recent study, when the metric graph is the circle $G=S^1$ with circumference $2\pi$, the equality $d_{GH}(S^1,X)=d_{H}(S^1,X)$ was established whenever $d_{GH}(S^1,X)&lt;\frac{\pi}{6}$. Our result for general metric graphs relaxes this hypothesis in the circle case to $d_{GH}(S^1,X)&lt;\frac{\pi}{3}$, and furthermore, we give an example showing that the constant $\frac{\pi}{3}$ is the best possible. We lower bound the Gromov--Hausdorff distance $d_{GH}(G,X)$ by the Hausdorff distance $d_{H}(G,X)$ via a simple topological obstruction: showing a correspondence with too small distortion contradicts the connectedness of $G$. Moreover, for two sufficiently dense subsets $X,Y\subseteq G$, we provide new lower bounds on $d_{GH}(X,Y)$ in terms of the Hausdorff distance $d_{H}(X,Y)$, which is $O(n^2)$-time computable if the subsets have at most $n$ points.</description>

      <title>The Reverse-log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firstly, we propose our conjectured Reverse-log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality (RLBM).
  Secondly, we show that the (RLBM) conjecture is equivalent to the log-Brunn-Minkowski (LBM) conjecture proposed by B\"or\"oczky-Lutwak-Yang-Zhang. We name this as ``reverse-to-forward" principle. Using this principle, we give a very simple new proof of the log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality in dimension two.
  Finally, we establish the ``reverse-to-forward" principle for the log-Minkowski inequality (LM). Using this principle, we prove the log-Minkowski inequality in the case that one convex body is a zonoid (the inequality part was first proved by van Handle). Via a study of the lemma of relations, the full equality conditions (``dilated direct summands") are also characterized, which turns to be new.</description>

      <title>CAT(0) and cubulated Shephard groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shephard groups are common generalizations of Coxeter groups, Artin groups, and graph products of cyclic groups. Their definition is similar to that of a Coxeter group, but generators may have arbitrary order rather than strictly order 2. We extend a well known result that Coxeter groups are $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ to a class of Shephard groups that have "enough" finite parabolic subgroups. We also show that in this setting, if the associated Coxeter group is type (FC), then the Shephard group acts properly and cocompactly on a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complex. As part of our proof of the former result, we introduce a new criteria for a complex made of $A_3$ simplices to be $\mathrm{CAT}(1)$.</description>
