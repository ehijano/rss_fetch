      <title>Spiking Neural Networks for SAR Interferometric Phase Unwrapping: A Theoretical Framework for Energy-Efficient Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data, propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.</description>

      <title>Brain2Model Transfer: Training sensory and decision models with human neural activity as a teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding. Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1) Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely artificial training.</description>

      <title>Metadata Enrichment of Long Text Documents using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this project, we semantically enriched and enhanced the metadata of long text documents, theses and dissertations, retrieved from the HathiTrust Digital Library in English published from 1920 to 2020 through a combination of manual efforts and large language models. This dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing research in areas such as computational social science, digital humanities, and information science. Our paper shows that enriching metadata using LLMs is particularly beneficial for digital repositories by introducing additional metadata access points that may not have originally been foreseen to accommodate various content types. This approach is particularly effective for repositories that have significant missing data in their existing metadata fields, enhancing search results and improving the accessibility of the digital repository.</description>

      <title>From On-chain to Macro: Assessing the Importance of Data Source Diversity in Cryptocurrency Market Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of data source diversity on the performance of cryptocurrency forecasting models by integrating various data categories, including technical indicators, on-chain metrics, sentiment and interest metrics, traditional market indices, and macroeconomic indicators. We introduce the Crypto100 index, representing the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and propose a novel feature reduction algorithm to identify the most impactful and resilient features from diverse data sources. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that data source diversity significantly enhances the predictive performance of forecasting models across different time horizons. Key findings include the paramount importance of on-chain metrics for both short-term and long-term predictions, the growing relevance of traditional market indices and macroeconomic indicators for longer-term forecasts, and substantial improvements in model accuracy when diverse data sources are utilized. These insights help demystify the short-term and long-term driving factors of the cryptocurrency market and lay the groundwork for developing more accurate and resilient forecasting models.</description>

      <title>ResQ: A Novel Framework to Implement Residual Neural Networks on Analog Rydberg Atom Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research in quantum machine learning has recently proliferated due to the potential of quantum computing to accelerate machine learning. An area of machine learning that has not yet been explored is neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) based residual neural networks (ResNets), which aim to improve the effectiveness of neural networks using the principles of ordinary differential equations. In this work, we present our insights about why analog Rydberg atom quantum computers are especially well-suited for ResNets. We also introduce ResQ, a novel framework to optimize the dynamics of Rydberg atom quantum computers to solve classification problems in machine learning using analog quantum neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Quantum Neural Network for Approximate SRBB-Based Unitary Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a scalable quantum neural network is introduced as a means to approximate any unitary evolution through the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB) and, subsequently, redesigned with a number of CNOTs asymptotically reduced by an exponential contribution. This algebraic approach to the problem of unitary synthesis exploits Lie algebras and their topological features to obtain scalable parameterizations of unitary operators. First, the original SRBB-based scalability scheme, already known in the literature only from a theoretical point of view, is reformulated for efficient algorithm implementation and complexity management. Remarkably, 2-qubit operators emerge as a special case outside the original scaling scheme. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed to reduce the number of CNOTs, thus deriving a new implementable scaling scheme that requires only one layer of approximation. The scalable CNOT-reduced quantum neural network is implemented and its performance is assessed with a variety of different unitary matrices, both sparse and dense, up to 6 qubits via the PennyLane library. The effectiveness of the approximation is measured with different metrics in relation to two optimizers: a gradient-based method and the Nelder-Mead method. The approximate CNOT-reduced SRBB-based synthesis algorithm is also tested on real hardware and compared with other valid approximation and decomposition methods available in the literature.</description>

      <title>HARPT: A Corpus for Analyzing Consumers' Trust and Privacy Concerns in Mobile Health Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HARPT, a large-scale annotated corpus of mobile health app store reviews aimed at advancing research in user privacy and trust. The dataset comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a baseline for future research. HARPT is released as a public resource to support work in health informatics, cybersecurity, and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>The Autonomy of the Lightning Network: A Mathematical and Economic Proof of Structural Decoupling from BTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or enforceable settlement guarantees.</description>

      <title>Communicating Smartly in the Molecular Domain: Neural Networks in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.</description>
