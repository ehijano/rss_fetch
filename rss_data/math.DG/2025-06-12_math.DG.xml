      <title>Symplectification of Rank 2 Distributions, Normal Cartan Connections, and Cartan Prolongations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Doubrov--Zelenko symplectification procedure for rank~2 distributions of maximal class -- originally motivated by optimal control theory -- through the lens of Tanaka--Morimoto theory for normal Cartan connections. In this way, for ambient manifolds of dimension $n \geq 5$, we prove the existence of the normal Cartan connection associated with the symplectified distribution. Furthermore, we show that this symplectification can be interpreted as the $(n-4)$th iterated Cartan prolongation at a generic point. This interpretation naturally leads to two questions for an arbitrary rank $2$ distribution of maximal class: (1) Is the $(n-4)$th iterated Cartan prolongation the minimal iteration where the Tanaka symbols become unified at generic points? (2) Is the $(n-4)$th iterated Cartan prolongation the minimal iteration admitting a normal Cartan connection via Tanaka--Morimoto theory? Our main results demonstrate that: (a) For $n &gt; 5$, the answer to the second question is positive (in contrast to the classical $n = 5$ case from $G_2$-parabolic geometries); (b) For $n \geq 5$, the answer to the first question is negative: unification occurs already at the $(n-5)$th iterated Cartan prolongation.</description>

      <title>A counter example for the Homogeneity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a counter example to show that the Homogeneity Conjecture, first proposed by J.A. Wolf in 1962, is not true. To be precise, we prove that on the Lie group Sp(2), there exists a left invariant Riemannian metric and a cyclic subgroup {\Gamma} of order (2n+1), such that the left translation of each element of {\Gamma} on Sp(2) is a Clifford-Wolf translation, but the Riemannian quotient {\Gamma}\Sp(2) is not homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Bubbling of rank two bundles over surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, motivated by the singularity formation of ASD connections in gauge theory, we study an algebraic analogue of the singularity formation of families of rank two holomorphic vector bundles over surfaces. For this, we define a notion of fertile families bearing bubbles and give a characterization of it using the related discriminant. Then we study families that locally form the singularity of the type $\mathcal{O}\oplus \mathcal{I}$ where $\mathcal{I}$ is an ideal sheaf defining points with multiplicities. We prove the existence of fertile families bearing bubbles by using elementary modifications of the original family. As applications, we study bubble trees for a few families that form singularities of low multiplicities and use examples to give negative answers to some plausible general questions.</description>

      <title>The existence and uniqueness of Hashiguchi connection in KG-approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we treat intrinsic Finsler geometry using the Klein-Grifone approach (KG-approach). A uniqueness and existence theorem for the Hashiguchi connection on a Finsler manifold is investigated intrinsically (in coordinate-free fashion). Calculations are made for the Hashiguchi connection's torsion and curvature tensors. Some properties are examined, together with the Bianchi identities of the associated curvature and torsion tensors. An overview of the four fundamental linear connections in Finsler geometry in the KG-approach is provided globally for comparison's sake and completeness.</description>

      <title>The capillary Gauss curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we first introduce a Gauss curvature type flow for capillary hypersurfaces, which we call capillary Gauss curvature flow. We then show that the flow will shrink to a point in finite time. This is a capillary counterpart (or Robin boundary counterpart) of Firey's problem studied in [Mathematika 21 (1974), pp. 1-11] and Tso [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 38 (1985), no. 6, 867-882]. Finally, we prove that its normalized flow converges to a soliton. This is a capillary counterpart of the result of Guan and Ni in [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 19 (2017), no. 12, 3735-3761]. The classification of solitons remains an open conjecture.</description>

      <title>Maximizing higher eigenvalues in dimensions three and above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing the $k$-th eigenvalue functional over the class of absolutely continuous measures on a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $m\geq 3$.
  For dimensions $3 \leq m \leq 6$, we generalize the work of Karpukhin and Stern on the first eigenvalue, showing that the maximizing measures are realized by smooth harmonic maps into finite-dimensional spheres.
  For $m \geq 7$, the maximizing measures are again induced by harmonic maps, which may now exhibit singularities. We prove that $m-7$ is the optimal upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set. More precisely, for any $m \geq 7$, there exist maximizing harmonic maps on the $m$-dimensional sphere whose singular sets have any prescribed integer dimension up to $m - 7$.</description>

      <title>Positivity of simplicial volume for closed nonpositively curved four-manifolds with nonzero Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Riemannian simplices due to Allendoerfer and Weil, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has nonzero Euler characteristic, then its simplicial volume is necessarily positive. This result partially resolves conjectures posed by Connell-Ruan-Wang and Gromov concerning the relationship between the simplicial volume and the Euler characteristic for four-dimensional manifolds. As an application, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has negative Ricci curvature, then its simplicial volume is positive, thereby confirming in dimension four another conjecture of Gromov on the positivity of simplicial volume.</description>

      <title>Decay and Strichartz estimates for critical electromagnetic wave equations on conic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the decay and Strichartz estimates for the wave equation with large scaling-critical electromagnetic potentials on a conical singular space $(X,g)$ with dimension $n\geq3$, where the metric $g=dr^2+r^2 h$ and $X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)\times Y$ is a product cone over the closed Riemannian manifold $(Y,h)$ with metric $h$. The decay assumption on the magnetic potentials is scaling critical and includes the decay of Coulomb type. The main technical innovation lies in proving localized pointwise estimates for the half-wave propagator by constructing a localized spectral measure, which effectively separates contributions from conjugate point pairs on $\CS$. In particular, when $Y=\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, our results, which address the case of large critical electromagnetic potentials, extend and improve upon those in [21], which considered sufficiently decaying, and small potentials and that of [24], which considered potentials decaying faster than scaling critical ones.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Riemannian Proximal Gradient Method for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the proximal gradient method on Riemannian manifolds for functions that are possibly not geodesically convex. Starting from the forward-backward-splitting, we define an intrinsic variant of the proximal gradient method that uses proximal maps defined on the manifold and therefore does not require or work in the embedding. We investigate its convergence properties and illustrate its numerical performance, particularly for nonconvex or nonembedded problems that are hence out of reach for other methods.</description>

      <title>Geometric effects of hyperbolic cohomology classes on K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifold, as a"topological" generalization of K\"ahler [Gro91] and weakly K\"ahler [BDET24] hyperbolic manifolds. Analogously to [BCDT24], we show the birational invariance of this property and then that K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds are not uniruled nor bimeromorphic to compact K\"ahler manifolds with trivial first real Chern class. Then, we prove spectral gap theorems for positive holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles on K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds, obtaining in particular effective non vanishing results \`a la Kawamata for adjoint line bundles. We finally explore the effects of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolicity on Ricci and scalar curvature of K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>Derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids in higher differential geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various problems arising in higher differential geometry using {\it derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids}.We first study Lie $\infty$-groupoids in various categories of derived geometric objects in differential geometry, including derived manifolds, derived analytic spaces, derived noncommutative spaces, and derived Banach manifolds. We construct category of fibrant objects (CFO) structures in the category of derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids. Then we study $L_{\infty}$-algebroids which are the infinitesimal counterpart of derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids. We then study the homotopical algebras for derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids and study their homotopy-coherent representations, which we call $\infty$-representations. We relate $\infty$-representations of $L_{\infty}$-algebroids to (quasi-) cohesive modules developed by Block, and $\infty$-representations of Lie $\infty$-groupoids to $\infty$-local system introduced by Block-Smith. Then we apply these tools in studying singular foliations and their characteristic classes. We construct Atiyah classes for $L_{\infty}$-algebroids pairs. We study singular foliations and their holonomies. We construct $\L_{\infty}$-algebroids for holomorphic singular foliations, and then We study elliptic involutive structures and prove an dg-enhancement of $V$-analytic coherent sheaves. These examples inspire us to define {\it perfect singular foliations}, which is a subcategory of singular foliation but with better homological algebras. Next, we construct various Lie $\infty$-groupoids for singular foliations. Then we study foliations on stacks and higher groupoids. Finally, we prove an $A_{\infty}$ de Rham theorem for foliations, and Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliated $\infty$-local system foliated manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a link between regular matroids and torus representations all of whose isotropy groups have an odd number of components. Applying Seymour's 1980 classification of the former objects, we obtain a classification of the latter. In addition, we prove optimal upper bounds for the cogirth of regular matroids up to rank nine, and we apply this to prove the existence of fixed-point sets of circles with large dimension in a torus representation with this property up to rank nine. Finally, we apply these results to prove new obstructions to the existence of Riemannian metrics with positive sectional curvature and torus symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be an $n$-dimensional asymptotically flat Riemannian manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature that admits a noncompact area-minimizing hypersurface $\Sigma \subset M$. In the case where $n = 3$, O. Chodosh and the first-named author have proven that $(M, g)$ is necessarily isometric to Euclidean space, confirming a conjecture of R. Schoen. In this paper, we extend this result to dimension $3 &lt; n \leq 7$ provided that $\Sigma$ arises as a limit of isoperimetric surfaces. By contrast, we prove that when $3 &lt; n \leq 7$, there is no such result for general noncompact area-minimizing $\Sigma \subset M$, even when additional assumptions on the stability of $\Sigma$ are imposed.</description>

      <title>Complex affine spheres and a Bers theorem for SL(3,C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $S$ a closed surface of genus at least $2$, let $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)$ be the Hitchin component of representations to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R}),$ equipped with the Labourie-Loftin complex structure. We construct a mapping class group equivariant holomorphic map from a large open subset of $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$ to the $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-character variety that restricts to the identity on the diagonal and to Bers' simultaneous uniformization on $\mathrm{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{T}(S)}$. The open subset contains $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{T}(S)}$ and $\mathrm{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$, and the image includes the holonomies of $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-opers.
  The map is realized by associating pairs of Hitchin representations to immersions into $\mathbb{C}^3$ that we call complex affine spheres, which are equivalent to certain conformal harmonic maps into $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{C})$ and to new objects called bi-Higgs bundles. Complex affine spheres are obtained by solving a second-order complex elliptic PDE that resembles both the Beltrami and Tzitz\'eica equations. To study this equation we establish analytic results that should be of independent interest.</description>

It shows that the smooth deformations of an ideal $\mathfrak i$ in a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ differentiate to cohomology classes in the cohomology of $\mathfrak g$ with values in its adjoint representation on $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathfrak i, \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i)$. The cohomology associated with the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in $\mathfrak g$ is compared with other Lie algebra cohomologies defined by $\mathfrak i$, such as the cohomology defined by $\mathfrak i$ as a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$ (Richardson, 1969), and the cohomology defined by the Lie algebra morphism $\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i$.
  After a choice of complement of the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, its deformation complex is enriched to the differential graded Lie algebra that controls its deformations, in the sense that its Maurer-Cartan elements are in one-to-one correspondence with the (small) deformations of the ideal. Furthermore, the $L_{\infty}$-algebra that simultaneously controls the deformations of $\mathfrak{i}$ and of the ambient Lie bracket is identified.
  Under appropriate assumptions on the low degrees of the deformation cohomology of a given Lie ideal, the (topological) rigidity and stability of ideals are studied, as well as obstructions to deformations of ideals of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Failure of the measure contraction property via quotients in higher-step sub-Riemannian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the synthetic Ricci curvature lower bound known as the measure contraction property (MCP) can fail in sub-Riemannian geometry. This may happen beyond step two, if the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, and it already occurs in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.
  Central to our analysis are new results, of independent interest, on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.
  As an application, we find sub-Riemannian structures with pre-medium-fat distribution that do not satisfy the MCP, answering a question raised in [L. Rifford, J. \'Ec. polytech. Math. 2023]. Finally, and quite unexpectedly, we show that ideal sub-Riemannian structures can fail the MCP, and this actually happens generically for rank greater than 3 and high dimension.</description>

      <title>Geometric Duality Between Constraints and Gauge Fields: Mirror Symmetry and Spencer Isomorphisms of Compatible Pairs on Principal Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a mirror symmetry theory of Spencer cohomology within the geometric framework of constrained systems on principal bundles, revealing deep symmetric structures in constraint geometry. Based on compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ under strong transversality conditions, we construct a systematic family of mirror transformations: from basic sign mirrors $\lambda \mapsto -\lambda$ to general automorphism-induced mirrors $\lambda \mapsto (d\phi)^*(\lambda)$. Our core result proves that these transformations preserve all geometric properties of compatible pairs and induce natural isomorphisms between Spencer cohomology groups. This theory unifies constraint mechanics, gauge field theory, and differential topology, establishing a complete mathematical framework for symmetry analysis of constraint systems and revealing the special mirror structure of Spencer complexes in constraint geometry.</description>

      <title>Constructing Two Metrics for Spencer Cohomology: Hodge Decomposition of Constrained Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a metric framework for Spencer complexes based on the geometric theory of compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ in principal bundle constraint systems, solving fundamental technical problems in computing Spencer cohomology of constraint systems. We develop two complementary and geometrically natural metric schemes: a tensor metric based on constraint strength weighting and an induced metric arising from principal bundle curvature geometry, both maintaining deep compatibility with the strong transversality structure of compatible pairs. Through establishing the corresponding Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, we rigorously prove that both metrics provide complete elliptic structures for Spencer complexes, thereby guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness and finite-dimensionality of Hodge decompositions. It reveals that the strong transversality condition of compatible pairs is not only a necessary property of constraint geometry, but also key to the elliptic regularity of Spencer operators, while the introduction of constraint strength functions and curvature weights provides natural weighting mechanisms for metric structures that coordinate with the intrinsic geometry of constraint systems. This theory tries to unify the differential geometric methods of constraint mechanics, cohomological analysis tools of gauge field theory, and classical techniques of Hodge theory in differential topology, establishing a mathematical foundation for understanding and computing topological invariants of complex constraint systems.</description>

      <title>Finite element form-valued forms: Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a finite element discretization of $\ell$-form-valued $k$-forms on triangulation in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for general $k$, $\ell$ and $n$ and any polynomial degree. The construction generalizes finite element Whitney forms for the de~Rham complex and their higher-order and distributional versions, the Regge finite elements and the Christiansen--Regge elasticity complex, the TDNNS element for symmetric stress tensors, the MCS element for traceless matrix fields, the Hellan--Herrmann--Johnson (HHJ) elements for biharmonic equations, and discrete divdiv and Hessian complexes in [Hu, Lin, and Zhang, 2025]. The construction discretizes the Bernstein--Gelfand--Gelfand (BGG) diagrams. Applications of the construction include discretization of strain and stress tensors in continuum mechanics and metric and curvature tensors in differential geometry in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry of Spencer-Hodge Decompositions in Constrained Geometric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the interaction mechanism between metric structures and mirror transformations in Spencer complexes of compatible pairs. Our core contribution is the establishment of mirror symmetry for Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, solving the key technical problem of analyzing the behavior of metric geometry under sign transformations. Through precise operator difference analysis, we prove that the perturbation $\mathcal{R}^k = -2(-1)^k \omega \otimes \delta^{\lambda}_{\mathfrak{g}}(s)$ induced by the mirror transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$ is a bounded compact operator, and apply Fredholm theory to establish the mirror invariance of harmonic space dimensions $\dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,\lambda} = \dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,-\lambda}$. We further prove the complete invariance of constraint strength metrics and curvature geometric metrics under mirror transformations, thus ensuring the spectral structure stability of Spencer-Hodge Laplacians. From a physical geometric perspective, our results reveal that sign transformations of constraint forces do not affect the essential topological structure of constraint systems, embodying deep symmetry principles in constraint geometry. This work connects Spencer metric theory with mirror symmetry theory, laying the foundation for further development of constraint geometric analysis and computational methods.</description>

      <title>Spencer-Riemann-Roch Theory: Mirror Symmetry of Hodge Decompositions and Characteristic Classes in Constrained Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of mirror symmetry in compatible pair Spencer complex theory brings new theoretical tools to the study of constrained geometry. Inspired by classical Spencer theory and modern Hodge theory, this paper establishes Spencer-Riemann-Roch theory in the context of constrained geometry, systematically studying the mirror symmetry of Spencer-Hodge decompositions and their manifestations in algebraic geometry. We utilize Serre's GAGA principle to algebraic geometrize Spencer complexes, establish coherent sheaf formulations, and reveal the topological essence of mirror symmetry through characteristic class theory. Main results include: Riemann-Roch type Euler characteristic computation formulas for Spencer complexes, equivalence theorems for mirror symmetry of Hodge decompositions at the characteristic class level, and verification of these theories in concrete geometric constructions. Research shows that algebraic geometric methods can not only reproduce deep results from differential geometry, but also reveal the intrinsic structure of mirror symmetry in constrained geometry through characteristic class analysis, opening new directions for applications of Spencer theory in constrained geometry.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Spencer Differential Degeneration Theory and Its Applications in Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the compatible pair theory of principal bundle constraint systems, this paper discovers and establishes a complete Spencer differential degeneration theory. We prove that when symmetric tensors satisfy a $\lambda$-dependent kernel condition $\delta_{\mathfrak{g}}^{\lambda}(s)=0$, the Spencer differential degenerates to the standard exterior differential, thus establishing a precise bridge between the complex Spencer theory and the classical de Rham theory. One of the advances in this paper is the rigorous proof that this degeneration condition remains stable under mirror transformations, revealing the profound symmetry origins of this phenomenon. Based on these rigorous mathematical results, we construct a canonical mapping from degenerate Spencer cocycles to de Rham cohomology and elucidate its geometric meaning. Finally, we demonstrate the application potential of this theory in algebraic geometry, particularly on K3 surfaces, where we preliminarily verify that this framework can systematically identify (1,1)-Hodge classes satisfying algebraicity conditions. This work provides new perspectives and technical approaches for studying algebraic invariants using tools from constraint geometry.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Normal Form Power Series for Infinite-Dimensional Lie Pseudo-Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of normal form power series for suitably nonsingular analytic submanifolds under a broad class of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-group actions. Our theorem is illustrated by a number of examples, and includes, as a particular case, Chern and Moser's celebrated convergence theorem for normal forms of real hypersurfaces. The construction of normal forms relies on the equivariant moving frame method, while the convergence proof is based on the realization that the normal form can be recovered as part of the solution to an initial value problem for an involutive system of differential equations, whose analyticity is guaranteed by the Cartan-K\"ahler Theorem.</description>

      <title>On the connectedness of the singular set of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a codimension 1 singular holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^3$ and let $Z$ be the union of the 1-dimensional connected components of its singular set; Dominique Cerveau asked in 2013 whether $Z$ is necessarily connected. We prove that if a $k$-dimensional holomorphic foliation on a projective manifold whose determinant bundle of the normal sheaf is ample has a singular set $Z$ of dimension $k-1$, then $Z$ is connected. This can be regarded as providing an obstruction for the integrability of singular holomorphic distributions in the spirit of Bott's work.</description>
