      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the nuclear shell model by the complex Langevin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear shell model is known to describe the properties of various nuclei extremely well. However, the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations cannot be applied to it with general interactions due to the sign problem. The model has therefore been investigated primarily by variational methods, where the accuracy of the results depends crucially on the ansatz for the wave function. Here we perform the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the case of small systems at finite temperature using the complex Langevin method (CLM), which has been successfully applied to various interesting systems with the sign problem over the decade. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter region in which the validity criterion for the CLM is satisfied and the expectation value of the energy obtained by exact diagonalization is correctly reproduced. Thus the CLM can be a complementary approach to the variational method for large systems.</description>

      <title>High-precision determination of radiative corrections to superallowed nuclear beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superallowed $0^+\rightarrow 0^+$ transitions between $T=1$ nuclei have been a perfect avenue avenue for determining the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, which imposes powerful constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model at low energies. For a long time, the precision of $V_{ud}$ has been limited by uncertainties in radiative corrections that arise from non-perturbative strong interaction physics at both the hadronic and nuclear levels. In this talk, I will describe some recent efforts to pin down these corrections by combining dispersive analysis with experimental data, lattice QCD, and nuclear many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>System-size dependence of $\gamma$-jet modifications in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium modifications of the $\gamma$-triggered jets are investigated with the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model in heavy-ion collisions with varying system sizes, focusing on centrality dependence in Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC. Our numerical results reveal that jets produced in central collisions exhibit a wider transverse asymmetry ($A_N^y$) distribution, a broader jet shape, and a more pronounced $\gamma$-jet transverse momentum imbalance ($X_{J\gamma}=p_T^{\rm jet}/p_T^\gamma$) compared to peripheral collisions. These effects arise from the longer path length and stronger jet-medium interactions in central collisions, leading to enhanced jet quenching and medium response. Our findings demonstrate that the magnitude of $\gamma$-jet modifications is sensitive to the size and centrality of the collision system, with larger systems inducing more significant alterations due to increased energy loss and medium feedback.</description>

      <title>B(E2) anomaly and triaxial deformation within a two-fluid SU(3) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation between $B(E2)$ structure and triaxial deformation has been investigated within the framework of the proton-neutron boson model. The analysis reveals that the distinctive feature, characterized by $B(E2;4_1^+\rightarrow2_1^+)/B(E2;2_1^+\rightarrow0_1^+)&lt;1.0$ along with $E(4_1^+)/E(2_1^+)&gt;2.0$, can emerge from the triaxial SU(3) symmetry inherent in two-fluid boson systems, attributed to band-mixing effects. This suggests a symmetry-based understanding of the anomalous $E2$ transitions observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Algebraic description of the triaxially to axially rotational shape phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the interacting boson model, we propose a novel algebraic scheme to describe spin-dependent structural evolutions in triaxial nuclei. Our analysis demonstrates that a triaxially to axially rotational shape phase transition can be induced by the high-order correction which is microscopically motivated by the pairing interaction on the $\gamma$-unstable rotation. This prescription is further applied to describe the structural evolutions along the yrast sequences of $^{132}$Ba and $^{130}$Xe, providing an exemplary case for demonstrating a unified explanation of both low-energy collective structures and high-spin phenomena in O(6)-like nuclei.</description>

      <title>B(E2) anomaly and triaxial deformation in the interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influences of triaxial dynamics on the anomalous $E2$ transitional behaviors in the interacting boson model (IBM) have been comprehensively examined without symmetry restrictions. Specifically, different triaxial schemes in the IBM have been analyzed using a general procedure for deriving triaxial rotor modes based on two distinct approaches. The results indicate that the $B(E2)$ anomaly feature, characterized by $B_{4/2}=B(E2;4_1^+\rightarrow2_1^+)/B(E2;2_1^+\rightarrow0_1^+)&lt;1.0$, can occur in all triaxial schemes due to strong band-mixing effects. This finding is further tested in describing the available data for $^{172}$Pt,~$^{168,170}$Os and $^{166}$W using the model constructed upon the extended consistent-$Q$ formula, providing a simple theoretical explanation of the depressed $B_{4/2}$ values observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Helicity amplitudes of $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ including pentaquark components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the helicity amplitudes of the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances in the electromagnetic transition process $\gamma^*p\to N^*$, where the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ are assumed to include both the $L=1$ three-quark and $L=0$ spatial symmetric $q^4\bar q$ pentaquark components. The helicity transition amplitudes $A_{1/2}$, $A_{3/2}$ (for spin 3/2 states) and $S_{1/2}$ are computed within the constituent quark model. The inclusion of the $q^4 \bar q$ pentaquark components via the $\gamma^*\to q\bar q$ diagram significantly improves the theoretical description of the helicity amplitudes for both $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$, yielding a closer agreement with experimental data compared to the pure three-quark picture. The work reveals that the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances may contain a considerable pentaquark components.</description>

      <title>Dilepton Spectra and Even Flow Harmonics in a Magnetized QGP: An Ideal Hydrodynamic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of dilepton production from a hot, magnetized quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions (HIC), incorporating realistic, time-dependent, and spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field profiles within an analytically solvable Gubser flow background. This framework provides a significant improvement over previous static calculations with homogeneous fields and moves toward the long-term goal of full $3+1$D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We explore the effects of impact parameter, electrical conductivity, and invariant mass on the dilepton spectra and anisotropic even flow coefficients. It is found that transverse momentum spectra increase with impact parameter, dominated by annihilation processes, while decay contributions remain sub-leading. Strikingly, the elliptic flow $v_2$ from decay channels is nonzero even in nearly central collisions, exhibiting a characteristic shape--positive at low $p_T$ and negative at high $p_T$--that is largely independent of impact parameter and conductivity. In contrast, $v_2$ from annihilation processes is smaller in magnitude but dominates the total flow in magnitude due to its larger yield. Higher harmonics, such as $v_4$, are an order of magnitude smaller as compared to $v_2$ along with distinctive zero-crossing patterns. Conductivity enhances both spectra and flow but leaves no unambiguous signature for its extraction. Varying the invariant mass reveals the strongest enhancements at low mass, with harmonic coefficients suppressed at higher masses. Overall, our results suggest that central and semi-central collisions can carry imprints of the background magnetic field, and that characteristic correlations in even flow harmonics may provide a robust probe of electromagnetic effects in HICs.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements complete up to N$^2$LO in heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate all nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) up to next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) for the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of the nuclei most relevant for experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{100}$Mo, and $^{136}$Xe. We use the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the nuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum (ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in $0\nu\beta\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that the overall N$^2$LO contribution is centered around $-(5$-$10)\%$ for the shell model and $+(10$-$15)\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the scale dependence of the ultrasoft NMEs and the short-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body methods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour of the intermediate states of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Within uncertainties, our results for the ultrasoft NME are of similar size as contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure approximation''.</description>

      <title>Two-Body Triton Photodisintegration and Wigner-SU(4) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the two-body triton photodisintegration cross section as a function of photon energy to next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) in pionless effective field theory (EFT($\pi \!\!/$)) and show good agreement with experiment. In addition we calculate the polarization asymmetry $R_C=-0.441(15)$ in cold neutron-deuteron capture to NNLO in EFT($\pi \!\!/$), in agreement with the experimental value of $R_C=-0.42\pm 0.03$ [M. W. Konijnenberg et al. in Phys. Lett. B 205, 215 (1988)]. We also assess the dependence of $R_C$ on different fits of the two-nucleon magnetic currents. Finally, we consider the impact of Wigner-SU(4) symmetry and demonstrate that starting from the Wigner-SU(4) symmetric limit and including perturbative corrections to the breaking of Wigner-SU(4) symmetry does a good job of describing two-body triton photodisintegration.</description>

      <title>From Hyperons to Hypernuclei: A New Route to Unravel Proton Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) known as the hottest, least viscous, and most vortical fluid ever produced in terrestrial laboratories. Its vortical structure has been uncovered through the spin polarization of Lambda ($\Lambda$) hyperons, attributed to the spin-orbit coupling that transfers the system's orbital angular momentum to the quark spin, which is then inherited by hadrons via quark recombination or coalescence. However, $\Lambda$ polarization reflects primarily the strange-quark component, leaving the spin dynamics of the up and down quarks largely unexplored. Although the proton is an ideal probe, its stability makes direct measurements experimentally challenging. Here, we propose to unravel proton spin polarization via hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$) measurements, exploiting the fact that spin information is preserved when polarized nucleons and $\Lambda$ coalesce to form hypertriton. We show that, over a broad range of collision energies, the polarizations of proton, $\Lambda$, and hypertriton are related by a simple linear scaling law. Since both $\Lambda$ and hypertriton polarizations can be measured via their self-analyzing weak decays, this linear relation provides a practical experimental avenue for accessing spin polarizations of protons and neutrons-the dominant baryonic degrees of freedom in nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality parameters of microscopic optical potentials from Skyrme-based nuclear structure models at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-locality parameters $ \beta $ in nucleon-nucleus interactions for $ ^{16}\mathrm{O} $, $ ^{40}\mathrm{Ca} $, $ ^{48}\mathrm{Ca} $, and $ ^{208}\mathrm{Pb} $ using a microscopic optical potential (MOP) derived from nuclear structure models based on Skyrme self-consistent mean-field calculations at low incident energies. No ad hoc adjusted parameters were employed in the present calculations. The analysis reveals that the non-locality parameter exhibits a clear dependence on the radial position within the nucleus, the incident nucleon energy, and the choice of target nucleus. At incident energies below $30$ MeV, the $ \beta $ lies between $0.8$ fm and $1.2$ fm for all considered targets. For the light nucleus $^{16}\mathrm{O}$, the non-locality parameter in the interior is smaller than that on the surface, whereas for medium and heavy nuclei $( ^{40}\mathrm{Ca} $, $ ^{48}\mathrm{Ca} $, and $ ^{208}\mathrm{Pb} $ ), the values are comparable in both regions.</description>

      <title>Structure of the doubly magic nuclei $^{208}$Pb and $^{266}$Pb from ab initio computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical studies indicate that the superheavy neutron-rich nucleus $^{266}_{\ 82}$Pb$_{184}$ is doubly magic and at the neutron drip line. While its density distributions and single-particle energies have been computed, the structure of this nucleus is yet unknown. We perform ab initio computations of $^{266}$Pb using an interaction from an effective field theory of quantum chromodynamics tuned only on properties of nuclei with $A \leq 4$. We validate our theoretical framework by computing the first $2^+$ and $3^-$ excited states of $^{208}$Pb, finding agreement with experimental data. We confirm that $^{266}$Pb is doubly magic and show that its $3^-$ state, located below the $2^+$ state, exhibits an excitation gap of 2.6 MeV with respect to the ground state. Our calculations also suggest that this nucleus is at the neutron drip line.</description>

Abstract: Multi-messenger observation of binary neutron-star mergers can provide valuable information on the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Here, we investigate to which extent electromagnetic observations of the associated kilonovae allow us to place constraints on the EoS. For this, we use state-of-the-art three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics simulations and detailed nucleosynthesis modeling to connect properties of observed light curves to properties of the accretion disk, and hence, the EoS. Using our general approach, we use multi-messenger observations of GW170817/AT2017gfo to study the impact of various sources of uncertainty on inferences of the EoS. We constrain the radius of a $\rm{1.4 M_\odot}$ neutron star to lie within $\rm{10.19\leq R_{1.4}\leq 13.0}$~km and the maximum mass to be $\rm{M_{TOV}\leq 3.06 M_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Training neural control variates using correlated configurations</title>

Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dark matter and $\sigma$-cut potential on radial and non-radial oscillation modes in neutron stars</title>

Abstract: We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS) employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of $\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut, we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect. For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequency, damping time, and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$ cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.</description>

      <title>Momentum expansions in finite-density perturbative calculations</title>

Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta.</description>
