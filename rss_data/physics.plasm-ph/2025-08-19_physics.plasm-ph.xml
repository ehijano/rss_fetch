      <title>A Detailed Configuration Accounting for the Hot Plasma Bound-Free Opacity Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of the hot plasma bound-free opacity according to the average atom models often leads to a noticeable effect of initial configuration on the shell ionization threshold. For the related problem of taking into account the impact of configurations while calculating bound-bound opacity, G. Hazak and Y. Kurzweil developed a method within the Super Transition Arrays approach. Fourier transform method is the adaptation of their method for a Detailed Configurations Accounting. The bound--free opacity coefficient qualitative behavior makes it somewhat difficult to construct a direct analogue of Fourier transform method of Detailed Configurations Accounting for its calculation. We use the probabilistic reformulation of the method to obtain the expressions for the bound--free opacity coefficient that take into account the spread of ionization thresholds due to the shell occupation numbers fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The Chapman-Enskog Divergence Problem in Plasma Transport: Structural Limitations and a Practical Regularization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate transport coefficients from the Chapman--Enskog expansion with BGK collision operators, obtaining exactly $\kappa = \frac{5nT}{2m\nu}$, and show that maximum entropy closure yields identical results when applied with the same collision operator. Through structural arguments, we suggest that this $1/\nu$ divergence extends to other local collision operators of the form $\mathcal{L} = \nu\hat{L}$, making the divergence fundamental to the Chapman--Enskog approach rather than a closure artifact. To address this limitation, we propose a phenomenological effective collision frequency $\nu_{\eff} = \nu\sqrt{1 + \Kn^2}$ motivated by gradient-driven decorrelation, where $\Kn$ is the Knudsen number. We verify that this regularization maintains conservation laws and thermodynamic consistency while yielding finite transport coefficients across all collisionality regimes. Comparison with exact solutions of a bounded kinetic model shows similar functional form, providing limited validation of our approach. This work provides explicit calculation of a known divergence problem in kinetic theory and offers one phenomenological regularization method with transparent treatment of mathematical assumptions versus physical approximations.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to constructing quasi-isodynamic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-axis theory for quasi-isodynamic stellarator equilibria is reformulated in terms of geometric inputs, to allow greater control of the ``direct construction'' of quasi-isodynamic configurations, and to facilitate understanding of the space of such equilibria. This includes a method to construct suitable magnetic axis curves by solving Frenet-Serret equations, and an approach to controlling magnetic surface shaping at first order (plasma elongation), which previously has required careful parameter selection or additional optimization steps. The approach is suitable for studying different classes of quasi-isodynamic stellarators including different axis ``helicities'' and topologies (e.g. knotted solutions), and as the basis for future systematic surveys using higher order near-axis theory. As an example application, we explore a family of configurations with per-field-period axis helicity equal to one half, demonstrating an approximate scaling symmetry relating different field period numbers.</description>

      <title>Density and Particle Sourcing Optimization in a Helicon Plasma Source Prototype For Wakefield Accelerator Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicon plasmas are being considered as plasma sources for wakefield accelerators, subject to strict density requirements. We present various mechanisms to increase axial density homogeneity in a helicon plasma for implementation in such an accelerator. We consider various background neutral flow configurations for helicons generated with first one antenna and then two identical antennas in a 2 meter long, 52 mm diameter plasma chamber with homogeneous magnetic field. In the case of a single antenna, the ionization source rate and density profiles are not significantly influenced by the background neutral flow. The use of a second antenna expands the plasma axially along the device, and results in an increased dependence of the axial density profile on the background neutral flow. We find an increase in axial homogeneity by a factor of two when there is no background neutral flow compared to when there is flow in either direction relative to the plasma. The minimum axial density deviation accomplished by optimization of RF antenna and neutral flow was 5%. This is still a factor of 20 above the nominal homogeneity requirement, but means to further improve this have been established in this study.</description>

      <title>Current sheet formation under radiative cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, analytically solvable MHD model of current sheet formation through X-point collapse under optically thin radiative cooling. Our results show that cooling accelerates the collapse of the X-point along the inflows, but strong cooling can arrest or even reverse the current sheet elongation in the outflow direction. Hence, we detail a modification to the radiatively-cooled Sweet-Parker model developed by Uzdensky &amp; McKinney (2011) to allow for varying current sheet length. The steady-state solution shows that when radiative cooling dominates compressional heating, the current sheet length is shorter than the system size, with an increased reconnection rate compared to the classical Sweet-Parker rate. The model and subsequent results lay out the groundwork for a more complete theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in regimes dominated by optically thin radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Tokamak Disruptions with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many disruptions are caused by resistive wall tearing modes (RWTM). A database of DIII-D locked mode disruptions provides two main disruption criteria, which are shown to be signatures of RWTMs. The first is that the q = 2 rational surface must be sufficiently close the resistive wall surrounding the plasma to interact with it. If active feedback is used, this implies that RWTMs can be prevented from causing major disruptions. This is demonstrated in simulations. The second criterion is that the current profile is sufficiently peaked. This is caused by edge cooling, such as by impurity radiation and turbulence, which suppress edge current and temperature. This implies the disruptions are not caused by neoclassical tearing modes (NTM), because the bootstrap current is also suppressed. At high $\beta,$ resistive wall modes (RWM) can be stabilized with feedback. Feedback also stabilizes high $\beta$ RWTMs, as shown in NSTX data and in simulations. These results suggest that RWTM disruptions in ITER might be prevented using the resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) coils.</description>

      <title>Simulation Study of Energy Chirp Induced Effects in Laser Wakefield Accelerator Driven Free Electron Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam energy compression via chicane magnets has been proved to be an effective method to reduce the slice energy spread of electron beams generated by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs). This technique has been widely adopted by leading research teams in experiments targeting future compact, high-gain free electron lasers (FELs). However, after energy compression, a strong beam energy chirp is introduced into the electron beam, which substantially hinders the microbunching process and impairs spectral coherence. Here, we present a detailed, unaveraged three-dimensional simulation that examines the effects of this energy chirp, and the results can be applied to the design of a proposed LWFA-driven VUV FEL. The energy chirp in a LWFA-produced electron beam causes FEL interactions at multiple resonant frequencies across the entire electron bunch, simultaneously, which prevents sustained radiation power growth at the designed frequency along the undulator. Consequently, spectral purity is significantly degraded. Additionally, due to undulator dispersion, the energy chirp leads to an elongation of the bunch length, which increases microbunch separation. This results in a noticeable redshift in the radiation frequency and further disruption of spectral purity. These effects are compared to the ideal scenario in which the energy chirp is removed following energy compression. Simulation results indicate that the implementation of a beam dechirper is a crucial step for improving the saturation of radiation power. Insights gained from this simulation of energy chirp-induced mechanisms will aid in the development of more effective compensation strategies, ultimately optimizing LWFA-driven FEL designs.</description>

      <title>From plasma to pattern: observation and characterization of periodic structure formation in dielectric breakdown channels of electron-irradiated insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric breakdown of insulators is one of the most common failure modes of electronics in the high-radiation environment of space, but its mechanics remain poorly understood. When electron-irradiated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) undergoes breakdown, the resulting channels exhibit striking periodic structures with characteristic wavelengths ~80 {\mu}m in the recently identified ivy-mode channels. These previously unobserved modulations offer unique insights into the physics of ultra-fast dielectric breakdown. Through materials characterization and theoretical modeling, we identify the physical instability mechanism responsible for these structures. Raman spectroscopy reveals that carbon deposition correlates with channel width variations, indicating that periodic structure formation occurs during the plasma discharge phase. We evaluated three candidate instability mechanisms: the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, and the z-pinch entropy mode. The first two mechanisms operate on incompatible timescales and require unphysical material parameters to match observations. In contrast, the z-pinch entropy mode operates during the nanosecond discharge phase and produces wavelengths consistent with plasma densities of 0.1-1% of solid density and temperatures of 10-100 eV. Current measurements from isolated discharge channels (~200 A) validate theoretical predictions for the entropy mode. These findings establish that the entropy mode plasma instability during the discharge phase, rather than post discharge thermal or mechanical processes, govern periodic structure formation in breakdown channels. This work provides new insights into the physics of dielectric breakdown and establishes a framework for predicting discharge morphology and characteristics in insulators.</description>

      <title>Extraction of classical ergotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the time dependent perturbation that extracts the maximal amount of energy (a.k.a. ergotropy) from a thermally isolated quantum system is a central, solved, problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum ergotropy problem.</description>

      <title>Approximating the Particle Distribution in Rotating and Tandem Mirror Traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady state distribution functions can be used to calculate stability conditions for modes, radiation energy losses, and particle loss rates. Heuristic analytic approximations to these distributions can capture key behaviors of the true distributions such as the relative speeds of different transport processes while possessing computational advantages over their numerical counterparts. In this paper, we motivate and present a closed-form analytic model for a distribution of particles in a centrifugal or tandem mirror. We find that our model outperforms other known models in approximating numerical steady-state simulations outside of a narrow range of low confining potentials. We demonstrate the model's suitability in the high confining potential regime for applications such as loss cone stability thresholds, fusion yields, and available energy.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that are in excellent agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce GeV-scale muons in numbers far exceeding those from cosmic background. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high yields, which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.</description>
