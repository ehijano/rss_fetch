      <title>Odomutants and flexibility results for quantitative orbit equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new systems that we call odomutants, built by distorting the orbits of an odometer. We use these transformations for flexibility results in quantitative orbit equivalence. It follows from the work of Kerr and Li that if the cocycles of an orbit equivalence are $\log$-integrable, the entropy is preserved. Although entropy is also an invariant of even Kakutani equivalence, we prove that this relation and $L^{\frac{1}{2}}$ orbit equivalence are not the same, using a non-loosely Bernoulli system of Feldman which is an odomutant.
  We also show that Kerr and Li's result on preservation of entropy is optimal, namely we find odomutants of all positive entropies orbit equivalent to an odometer, with almost $\log$-integrable cocycles. We actually build a strong orbit equivalence between uniquely ergodic Cantor minimal homeomorphisms, so our result is a refinement of a famous theorem of Boyle and Handelman. We finally prove that Belinskaya's theorem is optimal for all the odometers, namely for every odometer, we find a odomutant which is almost-integrably orbit equivalent to it but not flip-conjugate. This yields an extension of a theorem by Carderi, Joseph, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera.</description>

      <title>Fractal Patterns in Discrete Laplacians: Iterative Construction on 2D Square Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the iterative construction of discrete Laplacians on 2D square lattices, revealing emergent fractal-like patterns shaped by modular arithmetic. While classical 2222-style iterations reproduce known structures such as the Sierpinski triangle, our alternating binary-ternary (2322-style) process produces a novel class of aperiodic figures. These display low density variance, minimal connectivity loss, and non-repetitive organization reminiscent of Dekking's sequences. Fourier and autocorrelation analyses confirm their quasi-periodic nature, suggesting applications in self-assembly, sensor networks, and biological modeling. The findings open new paths toward structured randomness and fractal dynamics in discrete systems.
  These findings also open avenues for exploring higher-dimensional Laplacian constructions and their implications in quasicrystals, aperiodic tilings, and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the Hausdorff measure for the Gauss map and its linearized analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n\in\mathbb N$ we consider the set $J_n$ of points in the interval [0,1] whose continued fraction expansion entries are bounded by n. Similarly, we consider the set $J_n$ for the linearized analogue of the Gauss map. We study the asymptotic of the Hausdorff measure of the set $J_n$, (evaluated at its Hausdorff dimension). We obtain precise asymptotics for the linearized Gauss map and the same one -sided bound for the asymptotics for the original Gauss map.</description>

      <title>A simple description of blow-up solutions through dynamics at infinity in nonautonomous ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple criterion of the existence of (type-I) blow-up solutions for nonautonomous ODEs is provided. In a previous study [Matsue, SIADS, 24(2025), 415-456], geometric criteria for characterizing blow-up solutions for nonautonomous ODEs are provided by means of dynamics at infinity. The basic idea towards the present aim is to correspond such criteria to leading-term equations associated with blow-up ansatz characterizing multiple-order asymptotic expansions, which originated from the corresponding study developed in the framework of autonomous ODEs. Restricting our attention to constant coefficients of leading terms of blow-ups, results involving the simple criterion of blow-up characterizations in autonomous ODEs can be mimicked to nonautonomous ODEs.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for interacting particle systems on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the eigenvalues of the graphon integral operator. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral analysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical simulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of stationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to the dynamical metastability of the system.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of the H\'enon map with additive bounded noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study bifurcations of attractors of the H\'enon map with additive bounded noise with spherical reach. The bifurcations are analysed using a finite-dimensional boundary map. We distinguish between two types of bifurcations: topological bifurcations and boundary bifurcations. Topological bifurcations describe discontinuous changes of attractors and boundary bifurcations occur when singularities of an attractor's boundary are created or destroyed. We identify correspondences between topological and boundary bifurcations of attractors and local and global bifurcations of the boundary map.</description>

      <title>Solvable Structures for Hamiltonian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate solvable structures associated to Hamiltonian equations. For a completely integrable Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom, we construct a canonical solvable structure consisting of $2n$ Hamiltonian vector fields. We derive explicit expressions for the corresponding Pfaffian forms, whose integration provides solutions to the Hamiltonian equations. We show that the upper $n$ forms give the action varibles, while the lower $n$ forms yield the angle variables of the system. This offers a novel interpretation of the Arnold--Liouville theorem in terms of solvable structures. We ilustrate the theory by deriving explicit solutions and action--angle variables for $n$ harmonic oscillators and the Calogero--Moser system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a new ergodic theorem for $\mathbb{R}^d$-actions involving averages over dilated submanifolds, thereby generalizing the theory of spherical averages. Our main result is a quantitative estimate for the error term of such averages valid for smooth functions under some effective mixing assumptions on the action. With the aid of this theorem, we investigate multiplicative-type Dirichlet-improvability for $(m\times n)$-matrices with real coefficients. In particular, we establish that almost all matrices are uniformly approximable by the function $x\mapsto x^{-1}(\log x)^{-1+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Results of this type motivate a question which can be thought as a strengthening of Littlewood's conjecture in multiplicative Diophantine approximation.</description>

      <title>Inducing contractions of the mother of all continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new, large class of continued fraction algorithms producing what are called contracted Farey expansions. These algorithms are defined by coupling two acceleration techniques -- induced transformations and contraction -- in the setting of Shunji Ito's natural extension of the Farey tent map, which generates `slow' continued fraction expansions. In addition to defining new algorithms, we also realise several existing continued fraction algorithms in our unifying setting. In particular, we find regular continued fractions, the second-named author's $S$-expansions, and Nakada's parameterised family of $\alpha$-continued fractions for all $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$ as examples of contracted Farey expansions. Moreover, we give a new description of a planar natural extension for each of the $\alpha$-continued fraction transformations as an explicit induced transformation of Ito's natural extension.</description>

Abstract: We study continuous 2-valued dynamical systems with discrete time (dynamics) on $\mathbb{C}$. The main question addressed is whether a 2-valued dynamics can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group. We construct a class of strongly invertible continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ such that none of these dynamics can be given by the action of any 2-valued group. We also construct an example of a continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ that is not strongly invertible but can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group.</description>

      <title>The Zimmer Program for partially hyperbolic actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zimmer's superrigidity theorems on higher rank Lie groups and their lattices launched a program of study aiming to classify actions of semisimple Lie groups and their lattices, known as the {\it Zimmer program}. When the group is too large relative to the dimension of the phase space, the Zimmer conjecture predicts that the actions are all virtually trivial. At the other extreme, when the actions exhibit enough regular behavior, the actions should all be of algebraic origin.
  We make progress in the program by showing smooth conjugacy to a bi-homogeneous model (up to a finite cover) for volume-preserving actions of semisimple Lie groups without compact or rank one factors, which have two key assumptions: partial hyperbolicity for a large class of elements ({\it totally partial hyperbolicity}) and accessibility, a condition on the webs generated by dynamically-defined foliations. We also obtain classification for actions of higher-rank abelian groups satisfying stronger assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that equilibrium measures for uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems have a local product structure, which plays an important role in their mixing properties. Existing proofs of this fact rely either on transfer operators or on leafwise constructions, and in particular are not well-suited to the approach to thermodynamic formalism based on Bowen's specification property. Here we provide an alternate proof based on the Gibbs property, which fits more comfortably in that approach.</description>

      <title>(S,w)-Gap Shifts and Their Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $S$-gap shifts have a dynamically and combinatorially rich structure. Dynamical properties of the $S$-gap shift can be related to the properties of the set $S$. This interplay is particularly interesting when $S$ is not syndetic such as when $S$ is the set of prime numbers or when $S=\{2^n\}$. It is a well known result that the entropy of the $S$-gap shift is given by $h(X) = \log \lambda$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ is the unique solution to the equation $\sum_{n \in S} \lambda^{-(n+1)}=1$. Fix a point $w$ of the full shift $\{1,2, \dots, k\}^\mathbb{Z}$. We introduce the $(S,w)$-gap shift which is a generalization of the $S$-gap shift consisting of sequences in $\{0,1, \dots, k\}^\mathbb{Z}$ in which any two $0$'s are separated by a word $u$ appearing in $w$ such that $|u|\in S$. We extend the formula for the entropy of the $S$-gap shift to a formula describing the entropy of this new class of shift spaces. Additionally we investigate the dynamical properties including irreducibility and mixing of this generalization of the $S$-gap shift.</description>

      <title>Variants of VC dimension and their applications to dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since its introduction by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in the 1960s, the VC dimension and its variants have played a central role in numerous fields. In this paper, we investigate several variants of the VC dimension and their applications to dynamical systems. First, we prove a new bound for a recently introduced generalization of VC dimension, which unifies and extends various extremal results on the VC, Natarajan, and Steele dimensions. This new bound allows us to strengthen one of the main theorems of Huang and Ye [Adv. Math., 2009] in dynamical systems. Second, we refine a key lemma of Huang and Ye related to a variant of VC dimension by providing a more concise and conceptual proof. We also highlight a surprising connection among this result, combinatorics, dynamical systems, and recent advances in communication complexity.</description>

Abstract: We provide a 3 dimensional contact geometric characterization of Anosov 3-flows based on interactions with Reeb dynamics. We investigate basic properties of the space of the resulting geometries and in particular show that such space is homotopy equivalent to the space of Anosov 3-flows. A technical theorem on the asymptotic synchronization of adapted norms is proved, which can be of broader interest.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking with High-Order Lie Bracket Approximations: Achieving Exponential Decay Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the further development of the Lie bracket approximation approach for extremum seeking systems. Classical results in this area provide extremum seeking algorithms with exponential convergence rates for quadratic-like cost functions, and polynomial decay rates for cost functions of higher degrees. This paper proposes a novel control design approach that ensures the motion of the extremum seeking system along directions associated with higher-order Lie brackets, thereby ensuring exponential convergence for cost functions that are polynomial-like but with degree greater than two.</description>
