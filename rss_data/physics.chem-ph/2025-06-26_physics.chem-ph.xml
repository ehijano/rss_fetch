      <title>Sparse Infrared Spectroscopy for Detection of Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce the complexity of infrared spectroscopy hardware while maintaining performance, a data informed, task-specific, spectral collection approach termed Sparse Infrared Spectroscopy (SIRS) is developed. Using a numerically based virtual experiment based on a quantitatively accurate infrared database, non-negative matrix factorization is used to identify the spectral pass bands of a minimal number of filters necessary to identify volatile organic compounds (VOC) within either an inert background or mixture of gases. The data-driven approach is found capable of identifying contaminants at the 1-10 part per million level (PPM) with $\mathrm{\sim~20-50}$ spectral samples as opposed to the more than 1,000 typical of a traditional infrared spectrum. Reasonably robust to both noise and the characteristics of the base compound in a mixture, the task-specific spectral sampling points to simplified hardware design that maintains performance.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in Hydrogen across the pressure-induced transition from molecular to atomic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersion of collective excitations in fluid Hydrogen along the isothermal line T=2500~K, including the region of molecular-to-atomis fluid transition, is studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The obtained density dependence of the adiabatic and high-frequency speed of sound contains a plateau in the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition. We show, that the five-variable thermo-viscoelastic model of generalized hydrodynamics for pure molecular H$_2$ and pure atomic (H) fluids is able to recover perfectly the AIMD-derived time correlation functions and sound eigenvalues nicely agree with the numerically estimated sound dispersion. In the region of the molecular-to-atomic fluid transition a dynamic model of chemical reacting mixture should be applied. We discuss the calculations of time correlation functions from molecular/atomic units in the reacting mixture from AIMD trajectories.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Centric Alchemical Free Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical workflow aimed at improving the accuracy of alchemical free energy (AFE) predictions by incorporating configuration interaction (CI) simulations using the book-ending correction method. This approach applies the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) over a coupling parameter {\lambda} to smoothly transition the system from molecular mechanics (MM) ({\lambda} = 0) to a quantum mechanics (QM) ({\lambda} = 1) description. The resulting correction is then applied to the classically (MM) computed AFE to account for the more accurate QM treatment. The standard book-ending procedure uses AMBER to simulate the MM region, and QUICK, AMBER's default QM engine, to handle the QM region with either the Hartree-Fock (HF) method or density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we introduce a novel interface to QUICK, via sander, that enables CI simulations, and can operate in two ways: A) via PySCF backend to perform full configuration interaction (FCI) using conventional computing resources, B) quantum-centric sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) workflow via Qiskit which leverages both quantum hardware and post-processing on conventional computing resources for CI simulations. In this workflow QUICK performs most steps of the calculations, but at user-defined intervals, it redirects the computation to either FCI or SQD backend to get the CI result. We computed the book-end corrections for the hydration free energy (HFE) of three small organic molecules (ammonia, methane, and water) to benchmark the proposed approach and demonstrate how quantum-computers can be used in AFE calculations. We believe that this approach can be scaled to more complex systems like drug-receptor interactions in future studies.</description>

      <title>Optically Addressing Circularly-Polarized Vibrations in Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly-polarized (CP) vibrations are the nuclear-motion analog of CP light, emerging in molecules with non-Abelian point-group symmetry that support orthogonal and degenerate vibrational normal modes. Here, we explore the optical addressability of CP vibrations, motivated by their potential as nanoscale angular momentum states suitable for information storage and manipulation. We investigate how symmetry-breaking chemical modifications affect a molecule's capacity to support CP vibrations. Notably, we find cases where modes retain their orthogonality and degeneracy in spite of such modifications, broadening the opportunities afforded by CP vibrations beyond non-Abelian point-group molecules. Prospects for experimental implementations using CP pump-probe techniques are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing valence electron and hydrogen dynamics using charge-pair imaging with ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in ultrafast science has been to directly track the coupled motions of electrons and nuclei in real-space and real-time. This study presents a significant step towards this goal by demonstrating the feasibility of time-resolved real-space tracking of valence electron and hydrogen dynamics during the photodissociation of ammonia (NH3) using MeV ultrafast electron diffraction. It is demonstrated that the enhanced temporal resolution, in conjunction with the analysis of the charge-pair distribution function, enables the disentanglement of the correlated motion of valence electrons and hydrogens in photoexcited ammonia molecule. The methodology employed in this study, which utilizes the charge-pair distribution function from ultrafast electron scattering to retrieve intertwined electron and nucleus dynamics, may open up new opportunities in the study of quantum dynamics for a wide range of molecules.</description>

      <title>Multi-Technique Characterization of Rhodium Gem-Dicarbonyls on TiO$_2$(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gem-dicarbonyls of transition metals supported on metal (oxide) surfaces are common intermediates in heterogeneous catalysis. While infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a standard tool for detecting these species on applied catalysts, the ill-defined crystallographic environment of species observed on powder catalysts renders data interpretation challenging. In this work, we apply a multi-technique surface science approach to investigate rhodium gem-dicarbonyls on a single-crystalline rutile TiO$_2$(110) surface. We combine spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to determine their location and coordination on the surface. IR spectroscopy shows the successful creation of gem-dicarbonyls on a titania single crystal by exposing deposited Rh atoms to CO gas, followed by annealing to 200-250 K. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) data reveal that these complexes are mostly aligned along the [001] crystallographic direction, corroborating theoretical predictions. Notably, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data reveal multiple rhodium species on the surface, even when the IR spectra show only the signature of rhodium gem-dicarbonyls. As such, our results highlight the complex behavior of carbonyls on metal oxide surfaces, and demonstrate the necessity of multi-technique approaches for the adequate characterization of single-atom catalysts.</description>

      <title>Correlated reaction coordinate motion produces non-additive rate enhancement for electron and energy transfer in multi-acceptor structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular structures with multiple donor, bridge, or acceptor units can display quantum interference effects that influence electron and energy transfer (ET and EnT) rates. Recent experiments found a 4- to 5-fold increase in ET rates for donor-acceptor structures with two acceptors compared to one. This result is surprising: simple classical or quantum analysis suggests a factor of two rate enhancement. We analyze the coupling interactions in multiple acceptor systems and find that rate enhancements beyond additive effects arise from acceptor-acceptor interactions that: 1) shift the reaction free energy, 2) change the donor-acceptor couplings, and 3) alter the reaction-coordinate motion. Consideration of these effects explains the observed rates in multi-acceptor systems and suggests strategies to tailor energy and electron transfer kinetics.</description>

      <title>Near-surface Defects Break Symmetry in Water Adsorption on CeO$_{2-x}$(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water interactions with oxygen-deficient cerium dioxide (CeO$_2$) surfaces are central to hydrogen production and catalytic redox reactions, but the atomic-scale details of how defects influence adsorption and reactivity remain elusive. Here, we unveil how water adsorbs on partially reduced CeO$_{2-x}$(111) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with chemically sensitive, oxygen-terminated probes, combined with first-principles calculations. Our AFM imaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features radically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed to molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface defects. While the experiments are carried out at cryogenic temperature, water was dosed at room temperature, capturing configurations relevant to initial adsorption events in catalytic processes. Density functional theory identifies Ce$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically favored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water orientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$ from Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures. By resolving how subsurface defects control water adsorption at the atomic scale, this work demonstrates the power of chemically selective AFM for probing site-specific reactivity in oxide catalysts, laying the groundwork for direct investigations of complex systems such as single-atom catalysts, metal-support interfaces, and defect-engineered oxides.</description>

      <title>Stern-Gerlach deflection of cryogenically cold polyatomic molecules in superfluid nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam deflection is capable of providing valuable information about the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters as well as the relaxation dynamics of their spins. However, observations have been hampered by magnetic couplings to excited vibrational and rotational states of polyatomic systems, which are challenging to control, characterize, and systematize. In this work, we carried out deflection measurements on superfluid helium nanodroplets doped with high-spin FeCl2 and CoCl2 molecules and their complexes. This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered. The issue of rates and mechanisms of molecular spin relaxation within the cryogenic helium matrix is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Rotational cooling of large trapped molecular ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a protocol for the sympathetic cooling of a molecular asymmetric top rotor co-trapped with laser-cooled atomic ions,based on resonant coupling between the molecular ion's electric dipole moment and a common vibrational mode of the trapped particles. By combining sympathetic sideband laser cooling with coherent microwave excitation, we demonstrate the efficient depopulation of arbitrary rotational subspaces and the ability to cool an incoherent distribution of rotational states into a single, well-defined quantum state. This capability opens the door to exploiting the rotational Hilbert space for applications in quantum information processing and high-precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic ImF instanton rate theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiclassical instanton theory captures nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling in chemical reactions. It was originally derived from two different starting points, the flux correlation function and the ImF premise. In pursuit of a nonadiabatic rate theory, a number of methods have been proposed; almost all based on the less rigorous ImF premise. Only recently, we introduced a rigorous nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory in the flux-correlation function framework which successfully bridges from the Born-Oppenheimer to the golden-rule limit. Here, we examine the previous ImF-based attempts and conclude that they do not capture the two limits correctly. In particular, we will highlight how the last in a series of developments, called mean-field ring-polymer instanton theory, breaks down in the golden-rule limit. We develop a new nonadiabatic ImF rate theory to remedy the failings of previous attempts while taking inspiration from them. We also consider the crossover from deep tunnelling to a high-temperature rate theory. We test our new nonadiabatic ImF theory on a range of models including asymmetric and multidimensional systems and we show reliable results for the deep-tunnelling regime but limitations for the related high-temperature rate theory.</description>

      <title>Electric field-induced clustering in nanocomposite films of highly polarizable inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nanocomposite film containing highly polarizable inclusions in a fluid background is explored when an external electric field is applied perpendicular to the planar film. For small electric fields, the induced dipole moments of the inclusions are all polarized in field direction, resulting in a mutual repulsion between the inclusions. Here we show that this becomes qualitatively different for high fields: the total system self-organizes into a state which contains both polarizations, parallel and antiparallel to the external field such that a fraction of the inclusions is counter-polarized to the electric field direction. We attribute this unexpected counter-polarization to the presence of neighboring dipoles which are highly polarized and locally revert the direction of the total electric field. Since dipoles with opposite moments are attractive, the system shows a wealth of novel equilibrium structures for varied inclusion density and electric field strength. These include fluids and solids with homogeneous polarizations as well as equilibrium clusters and demixed states with two different polarization signatures. Based on computer simulations of a linearized polarization model, our results can guide the control of nanocomposites for various applications, including sensing external fields, directing light within plasmonic materials, and controlling the functionality of biological membranes.</description>

      <title>Static Contact Angles of Mixtures: Classical Density Functional Theory and Experimental Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work assesses a classical density functional theory (DFT) model for predicting macroscopic static contact angles of pure substances and mixtures by comparison to own experimental data. We employ a DFT with a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) for the fluid-fluid interactions and an effective external potential for the solid-fluid interactions. The solid substrate is characterized by adjusting a single solid-solid interaction energy parameter to a single contact angle value of $n$-octane, while all other results are predictions based on Berthelot-Lorentz combining rules. The surface tensions between solid, liquid and vapor phases are determined from one-dimensional DFT calculations, and Young's equation is used to calculate the contact angle. A non-polar polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon) substrate is used, and experiments are carried out using the sessile droplet method with graphical evaluation of the contact angle. Accurate results are obtained for pure substances except for monohydric alcohols. Contact angles for monohydric alcohols are systematically overestimated, and we show that this is partially due to neglecting orientational effects. The approach provides accurate results for mixtures whenever the respective pure substance contact angle is described well. This comprises mixtures of non-polar, polar, and hydrogen bonding substances, including mixtures with water. Our results suggest that DFT based on PC-SAFT provides a fast and accurate method for prediction of contact angles for a wide range of pure substances and mixtures.</description>

      <title>On the rank-reduced relativistic coupled cluster method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficiency of the Tucker decomposition of amplitude tensors within the single-reference relativistic coupled cluster method with single and double excitations (RCCSD) was studied in a series of benchmark calculations for (AuCl)$_n$ chains, Au$_n$ clusters, and the cluster model of solid YbCl$_2$. The 1 kJ/mol level of accuracy for correlation energy estimates of moderate-size systems and typical reaction energies can be achieved with relatively high compression rates of amplitude tensors via rejecting singular values smaller than $\sim 10^{-4}$. For the most extensive system studied (YbCl$_7$ cluster used for modeling of ytterbium center in ytterbium dichloride crystal), only $\sim 3$% of compressed doubles amplitudes were shown to be significant. Thus, the rank reduction for the relativistic CCSD theory improving its computational scaling is feasible. The advantage (if not necessity) of using the Goldstone diagrammatic technique rather than the "antisymmetrized" Brandow one is underlined.

      <title>Interradical motion can push magnetosensing precision towards quantum limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Analytical Calculation of Viscosity in Rouse Networks Below Gelation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes an exact relationship between the zero-shear viscosity and the radius of gyration for generalized Rouse model with arbitrary network configurations. Building on this fundamental relationship, we develop a random graph approach to derive analytical expressions for network viscosity in mean-field connected systems through coarse-grained graph viscosity relations. The theory fully characterizes the subcritical regime, determining precise asymptotic behavior in both dilute and pre-gelation limits.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves Approach to Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11926v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new method for basis set generation for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids. This procedure is aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT). In this construction, Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW), we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the self consistent eigenstates of the final (converged) Kohn Sham (KS) Hamiltonian. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the self consistency iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, and augment it, inside each Muffin Tin (MT) sphere, with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the linearization energy of the energy window which contains the energy of that previous eigenstate. Indeed, to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous break up the spectrum into non-overlapping intervals, windows, and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window per angular momentum channel (at the linearization energy relevant to that window, usually near the middle of the window). For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the EWAPW basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Circuits: Modeling chemical reaction networks with nonequilibrium conductance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the nonequilibrium conductance matrix for open stationary Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) described by a deterministic mass action kinetic equation. As an illustration, we determine the nonequilibrium conductance matrix of a CRN made of two pseudo-linear sub-networks, called chemical modules, in two different ways: First by computing the nonequilibrium conductances of the modules that are then serially connected. Second by computing the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits.</description>

      <title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific approaches in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability. Code is available at github.com/ASK-Berkeley/OM-TPS.</description>

      <title>xChemAgents: Agentic AI for Explainable Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal graph neural networks has demonstrated that augmenting atomic XYZ geometries with textual chemical descriptors can enhance predictive accuracy across a range of electronic and thermodynamic properties. However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction. xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to a 22% reduction in mean absolute error over the state-of-the-art baselines, while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations. Experiment results highlight the potential of cooperative, self-verifying agents to enhance both accuracy and transparency in foundation-model-driven materials science. The implementation and accompanying dataset are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/xChemAgents.</description>

      <title>Taylor-mode automatic differentiation for constructing molecular rovibrational Hamiltonian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an automated framework for constructing Taylor series expansions of rovibrational kinetic and potential energy operators for arbitrary molecules, internal coordinate systems, and molecular frame embedding conditions. Expressing operators in a sum-of-products form allows for computationally efficient evaluations of matrix elements in product basis sets. Our approach uses automatic differentiation tools from the Python machine learning ecosystem, particularly the JAX library, to efficiently and accurately generate high-order Taylor expansions of rovibrational operators. The implementation is available at https://github.com/robochimps/vibrojet.</description>
