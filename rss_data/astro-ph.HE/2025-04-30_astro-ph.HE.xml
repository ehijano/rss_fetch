      <title>Expanding Ejecta Method: I. Mapping Supernova Morphology with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of optical intensity interferometry to extract angularly resolved information from supernova explosions, introducing the "expanding ejecta method" (EEM) as a robust alternative to the classical expanding photosphere method (EPM). Foreseeing future improvements to intensity interferometers of large light collection area ($25\pi\,\rm{m}^2$ per telescope) equipped with spectral multiplexing ($10^4$ spectral resolution) and fast photodetectors ($10\,\mathrm{ps}$ timing resolution, $50\%$ overall efficiency), we demonstrate that high signal-to-noise measurements of the visibility modulus are achievable for Type IIP (Type Ia) supernovae out to $3~(12)\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. By focusing on generic line emission and absorption in ballistic ejecta, the EEM can relax assumptions about spherical symmetry, blackbody radiation, and extinction. The EEM enables angular diameter distances to be determined with $\sim2\%$ precision for supernovae of apparent magnitude $m = 12$ from a 60-hour observation by an intensity interferometer with those same instrumental specifications. We argue that the EEM is significantly more robust to modeling uncertainties and systematic effects than (variants of) the EPM. In a companion paper, we show how the EEM can be used to provide geometric anchors for cosmic distance ladder calibration, or to construct a wholly independent Hubble diagram based on angular diameter distances.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger remnant: Roles of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($&gt;1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We also find that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for FFI, which offers a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting FFI based solely on fluid properties. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Solution for GSN 069 Disk Evolution: The Nature of 'Long-Lived' TDEs and Implications for QPE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully time-dependent relativistic disk model - based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD - into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is fully governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We apply the model to fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, spanning from its discovery in 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs - of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can be naturally explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, such as ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their key distinction lies in the 'viscous' timescale parameter - tied to the disk's stress and angular momentum transport efficiency - which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We show that existing QPE models cannot reproduce the observed connection between the presence (e.g., 2018) or absence (e.g., 2014) of eruptions and disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a major challenge for QPE models.</description>

      <title>Testing X-ray Reprocessing and Mapping the Soft Excess of NGC 7469 with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an X-ray/UV reverberation analysis of NGC 7469 across 210 days, using daily NICER observations with contemporaneous monitoring by Swift UVOT+XRT. We model the X-ray spectrum with a power law continuum and a soft excess during each NICER epoch. These emission sources demonstrate correlated flux variability with a lag consistent with zero days. We find that the power law emission is consistent with a compact X-ray corona, and that the soft excess can be explainedby reflected coronal emission from the inner accretion disk. We test the relationship between changes in the flux of the X-ray corona and the UVW2 continuum, finding strong correlation and a negative X-ray lag of less than one day. This is consistent with a scenario in which the X-ray corona drives the UVW2 light curve through thermal reprocessing</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray burst taxonomy: looking for the third class on the spectral peak energy-duration plane in the rest frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two classes of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), corresponding to the short/hard and the long/soft events, with a putative intermediate class, are typically considered in the observer frame. However, when considering GRB characteristics in the cosmological rest frame, the boundary between the classes becomes blurred. The goal of this research is to check for the evidences of a third "intermediate" class of GRBs and investigate how the transformation from the observer to the rest frame affects the hardness-duration-based classification. We applied fits with skewed and non-skewed (symmetric) Gaussian and Student distributions to the sample of 409 GRBs with reliably measured redshifts to cluster the bursts on the hardness (Ep) - duration (T90) plane. We found that, based on AIC/BIC criteria, the statistically preferred number of clusters on the GRB rest-frame hardnesses-duration plane does not exceed two. We also assess the robustness of the clustering technique. We did not find any solid evidence of an intermediate GRB class on the rest-frame hardness-duration plane.</description>

      <title>Pair-Instability Gap Black Holes in Population III Star Clusters: Pathways, Dynamics, and Gravitational Wave Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW190521 raises questions about the formation of black holes within the pair-instability mass gap (PIBHs). We propose that Population III (Pop III) star clusters significantly contribute to events similar to GW190521. We perform $N$-body simulations and find that PIBHs can form from stellar collisions or binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with the latter accounting for 90\% of the contributions. Due to GW recoil during BBH mergers, approximately 10-50% of PIBHs formed via BBH mergers escape from clusters, depending on black hole spins and cluster escape velocities. The remaining PIBHs can participate in secondary and multiple BBH formation events, contributing to GW events. Assuming Pop III stars form in massive clusters (initially 100,000 $M_\odot$) with a top-heavy initial mass function, the average merger rates for GW events involving PIBHs with 0% and 100% primordial binaries are $0.005$ and $0.017$ $\text{yr}^{-1} \text{Gpc}^{-3}$, respectively, with maximum values of $0.030$ and $0.106$ $\text{yr}^{-1} \text{Gpc}^{-3}$. If Pop III stars form in low-mass clusters (initial mass of $1000M_\odot$ and $10000 M_\odot$), the merger rate is comparable with a 100% primordial binary fraction but significantly lower without primordial binaries. We also calculate the characteristic strains of the GW events in our simulations and find that about 43.4% (LISA) 97.8% (Taiji) and 66.4% (Tianqin) of these events could potentially be detected by space-borne detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. The next-generation GW detectors such as DECIGO, ET, and CE can nearly cover all these signals.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a variable yellow supergiant progenitor for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag decline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightness and color fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that a variable progenitor has been found for a SN IIb. We suggest that the variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of varying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor of SN 2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of 12--14, 14--15 and 15--18 Msun for different assumed values of circumstellar reddening of E(B-V)_CSM = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the critical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of core-collapse supernovae progenitors.</description>

      <title>A polarized view of the young Pulsar Wind Nebula 3C 58 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Wind nebulae (PWNe), are among the most efficient particle accelerators in the Universe, however understanding the physical conditions and the magnetic geometry in their inner region has always proved elusive. X-ray polarization provides now a unique opportunity to investigate the magnetic field structure and turbulence properties close to where high energy particles are accelerated. Here we report on the recent X-ray polarization measurement of the PWN 3C 58 by the International X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE). 3C 58 is a young system displaying a characteristic jet-torus structure which, unlike other PWNe, is seen almost edge on. This nebula shows a high level of integrated polarization ~ 22% at an angle ~ 97deg, with an implied magnetic field oriented parallel to the major axis of the inner torus, suggesting a toroidal magnetic geometry with little turbulence in the interior, and an intrinsic level of polarization possibly approaching the theoretical limit for synchrotron emission. No significant detection of a polarized signal from the associated pulsar was found. These results confirm that the internal structure of young PWNe is far less turbulent than previously predicted, and at odds with multidimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Accretion and ejection at work in the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0323+342 - A case of intermittent activity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the properties of 1H 0323+342, a prominent jetted narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. The primary objective is to understand the interplay between the relativistic jet, the hot corona, and the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole. This study spans the years 2006 to 2023, incorporating a rich dataset with 172 Swift observations, including the optical, UV, and X-ray bands, integrated with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. Spectral analysis was conducted on the X-ray observations using the XSPEC software, and the results were compared with optical, UV, and gamma-ray flux measurements and photon index values. Our key findings include the identification of three distinct zones in the X-ray photon index-flux plot, characterized by high flux and a hard photon index (zone 1), high flux and a soft photon index (zone 2), and low flux and a soft photon index (zone 3). Before 2017, 1H 0323+342 moved back and forth between zones 1 and 2; after that epoch, it transitioned to zones 2 and 3. Correspondingly, we observed a decreasing jet activity in the Fermi/LAT data and a reduction in the accretion rate in optical/UV data from Swift/UVOT. We interpret these observations in the framework of an intermittent jet scenario, driven by radiation-pressure instability in the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>How to turn a Supernova into a PeVatron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. It is important to determine which Galactic cosmic-ray sources can accelerate particles to the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum at a few PeV, and in particular whether supernova remnants may contribute. Current models for particle acceleration in very young remnants assume the circumstellar material consists of smooth, freely expanding winds. There is strong evidence that some supernovae expand into much denser circumstellar material including dense shells ejected by eruptions shortly before explosion.
  Aims. We investigate the effects of dense circumstellar shells on particle acceleration in supernova shocks during the first few years post-explosion, to quantify whether such interaction supernovae may act as PeVatrons.
  Methods. We used the pion code to model the circumstellar medium around Luminous Blue Variables after having a brief episode with a mass-loss rate of up to dM/dt = 2Msol/yr. Consequently, we performed spherically symmetric 1-D simulations using our time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC in which we simultaneously solve the transport equations for cosmic-rays, magnetic turbulence, and the hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in the test-particle limit.
  Results. We find that the interaction with the circumstellar shells can significantly boost the maximum energy by enhancing particle escape during the onset of the shock-shell interaction followed by the reacceleration of the shock propagating into a medium with a pre-amplified field. Early interactions boost the maximum energy to a greater degree and interactions within the first 5 months after explosion can increase Emax to more then 1 PeV.</description>

      <title>Modeling of the time-resolved spectral energy distribution of blazar OJ 287 from 2008 to 2023: a comprehensive multi-epoch study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the time-resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the blazar OJ 287 over a 15-year period (2008-2023), using multi-wavelength data. In the $\gamma$-ray band, multiple flaring episodes were observed, with the strongest flare reaching a peak flux of $(5.60\pm1.11)\times10^{-7}\:{\rm photons\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ on MJD 55869.03 (04 November 2011). In the optical/UV band, the source was in an active state between MJD 57360 (04 December 2015) and 57960 (26 July 2017), during which the highest flux of $(1.07\pm0.02)\times10^{-10}\:{\rm erg\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ was observed on MJD 57681.23 (20 October 2016). In the X-ray band, both the flux and spectral index exhibit variability. To investigate the origin of the broadband emission from OJ 287, we systematically modeled 739 quasi-simultaneous SEDs using a leptonic model that self-consistently accounts for particle injection and cooling. This analysis is possible thanks to the recent development of a surrogate neural-network-based model, trained on kinetic simulations. This innovative, time-resolved, neural network-based approach overcomes the limitations of traditional single-epoch SED modeling, enabling to explore the temporal evolution of key model parameters, such as the magnetic field strength, Doppler factor, and electron injection distribution, across different states of the source. We identified distinct emission states characterized by unique combinations of magnetic field $ B $, electron index $ p $, and Doppler boost $ \delta $, associated to different underlying mechanisms such as varying acceleration processes (e.g., shocks, turbulence) and magnetic confinement. The analysis provides insights into the jet physics processes, including particle acceleration mechanisms and dynamic changes in the jet structure.</description>

      <title>Timing analysis of the black-hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613: detection of a dip-like feature in the high-energy cross spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a timing analysis of observations with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope of the black hole X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613 during its 2023 outburst. We detect, for the first time in a black hole X-ray binary, a prominent dip at ~ 3-15 Hz in the real part of the cross spectrum between high-energy (&gt;25 keV) and low-energy (&lt;10 keV) photons in the Low Hard and Hard Intermediate States, during which the QPO frequency rapidly increases and then stabilizes at ~ 1.0-1.5 Hz. Remarkably, the real part of the cross spectrum reaches negative values at the frequencies around the minimum of the dip, indicative of a phase lag ranging between ${\pi}/2$ and ${\pi}$ in this frequency range. We fit the power spectra and the real and imaginary parts of the cross spectra simultaneously using a multi-Lorentzian model. Among the lag models, the Gaussian phase-lag model provides a slightly better reduced ${\chi}^2$ than the constant phase-lag and constant time-lag models, while it also alleviates the degeneracy associated with those models. From the parameters of the Lorentzian that fits the dip, we estimate the size of the accretion flow, which consistently exceeds 10,000 km as the QPO frequency increases from 0.13 Hz to 2.0 Hz. Furthermore, both the energy-dependent phase-lag and fractional-rms spectra of the dip exhibit a change in trend around 15 keV, with the phase lag dropping and rms reaching a local minimum. These spectra closely resemble the shapes predicted by the time-dependent Comptonization model, vKompth, for a low feedback factor, offering a pathway to explain the radiative properties of the corona. Additionally, the coherence function suggests a diversity of variability components, potentially arising from different parts of the corona.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength correlation studies in the era of CTAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between various multiwavelength (MWL) bands are an intermittent feature in blazar light curves; that is, they are observed in some instances but not in others. With the CTAO we will obtain detailed very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray light curves for many sources also during their low states, enabling detailed MWL correlation studies. For two blazars, the HBL Mrk\,421 and the FSRQ PKS\,1510-089, the long-term X-ray and optical light curves are used to induce variations in input parameters of the lepto-hadronic one-zone code OneHaLe. We show light curves in the CTA energy range for three different energy thresholds. The results are: 1) the presence of relativistic protons has a significant effect on the correlation of the light curves as the emerging pair cascade prolongs flaring states at the highest energies; and 2) comparison of the theoretical light curves with existing VHE gamma-ray data shows that both leptonic and hadronic models can only partially reproduce the data.</description>

      <title>Numerical Relativity Simulations of Dark Matter Admixed Binary Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers provide insight into strong-field gravity and the properties of ultra-dense nuclear matter. These events offer the potential to search for signatures of physics beyond the standard model, including dark matter. We present the first numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers admixed with dark matter, based on constraint-solved initial data. Modeling dark matter as a non-interacting fermionic gas, we investigate the impact of varying dark matter fractions and particle masses on the merger dynamics, ejecta mass, post-merger remnant properties, and the emitted gravitational waves. Our simulations suggest that the dark matter morphology - a dense core or a diluted halo - may alter the merger outcome. Scenarios with a dark matter core tend to exhibit a higher probability of prompt collapse, while those with a dark matter halo develop a common envelope, embedding the whole binary. Furthermore, gravitational wave signals from mergers with dark matter halo configurations exhibit significant deviations from standard models when the tidal deformability is calculated in a two-fluid framework. This highlights the need for refined models in calculating the tidal deformability when considering mergers with extended dark matter structures. These initial results provide a basis for further exploration of dark matter's role in binary neutron star mergers and their associated gravitational wave emission and can serve as a benchmark for future observations from advanced detectors and multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Possible evidence for the 478 keV emission line from $^7$Be decay during the outburst phases of V1369 Cen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After decades of uncertainty about the origin of lithium, recent evidence suggests Galactic novae as its main astrophysical source. In this work, we present possible evidence for the first detection of the $^7$Be line at 478 keV, observed with the INTEGRAL satellite. The emission is temporally and spatially coincident with the outburst of the bright nova V1369 Cen, and line significance ranges from 2.5$\sigma$ to $\sim$1.9$\sigma$, depending on the detection methodology. A bootstrap analysis, assuming a fixed FWHM of 8 keV, provides a flux of $(4.9 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{-4}$ ph/cm$^2$/s centered at 479.0 $\pm$ 2.5 keV, with a 2.5$\sigma$ significant excess. This flux implies a total $^7$Be mass of $M_{^7Be} = (1.2^{+2.0}_{-0.6})$ $\times 10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ at the distance determined using several indicators including the {\em Gaia} satellite. For a nova ejected mass estimated from radio observations, this result implies a $^7$Be=Li yield corresponding to $A(Li) = 7.1^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$. This value is comparable to those measured in a dozen novae through optical observations. Crucially, we confirm optically derived $^7$Li yields and demonstrate the groundbreaking potential of using gamma-ray data to measure Li abundances.</description>

      <title>Relativistic ejecta from stellar mass black holes: insights from simulations and synthetic radio images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of discrete relativistic ejecta from an X-ray binary (XRB) with initial conditions directly informed by observations. XRBs have been observed to launch powerful discrete plasma ejecta during state transitions, which can propagate up to parsec distances. Understanding these ejection events unveils new understanding of jet-launching, jet power, and jet-ISM interaction among other implications. Multi-frequency quasi-simultaneous radio observations of ejecta from the black hole XRB MAXI J1820+070 produced both size and calorimetry constraints, which we use as initial conditions of a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation. We qualitatively reproduce the observed deceleration of the ejecta in a homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM). Our simulations demonstrate that the ejecta must be denser than the ISM, the ISM be significantly low-density, and the launch be extremely powerful, in order to propagate to the observed distances. The blob propagates and clears out a high-pressure low-density cavity in its wake, providing an explanation for this pre-existing low-density environment, as well as 'bubble-like' environments in the vicinity of XRBs inferred from other studies. As the blob decelerates, we observe the onset of instabilities and a long-lived reverse shock -- these mechanisms convert kinetic to internal energy in the blob, responsible for in-situ particle acceleration. We transform the outputs of our simulation into pseudo-radio images, incorporating the u,v coverage of the MeerKAT and e-MERLIN telescopes from the original observations with real-sky background. Through this, we maximize the interpretability of the results and provide direct comparison to current data, as well as provide prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>XRISM forecast for the Coma cluster: stormy, with a steep power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XRISM Resolve microcalorimeter array measured the velocities of hot intracluster gas at two positions in the Coma galaxy cluster: 3'x3' squares at the center and at 6' (170 kpc) to the south. We find the line-of-sight velocity dispersions in those regions to be sigma_z=208+-12 km/s and 202+-24 km/s, respectively. The central value corresponds to a 3D Mach number of M=0.24+-0.015 and the ratio of the kinetic pressure of small-scale motions to thermal pressure in the intracluster plasma of only 3.1+-0.4%, at the lower end of predictions from cosmological simulations for merging clusters like Coma, and similar to that observed in the cool core of the relaxed cluster A2029. Meanwhile, the gas in both regions exhibits high line-of-sight velocity differences from the mean velocity of the cluster galaxies, Delta v_z=450+-15 km/s and 730+-30 km/s, respectively. A small contribution from an additional gas velocity component, consistent with the cluster optical mean, is detected along a sightline near the cluster center. The combination of the observed velocity dispersions and bulk velocities is not described by a Kolmogorov velocity power spectrum of steady-state turbulence; instead, the data imply a much steeper effective slope (i.e., relatively more power at larger linear scales). This may indicate either a very large dissipation scale resulting in the suppression of small-scale motions, or a transient dynamic state of the cluster, where large-scale gas flows generated by an ongoing merger have not yet cascaded down to small scales.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method of Modeling Extended Emission of Compact Jets: Application to Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat radio spectra of compact jets launched by both supermassive and stellar-mass black holes are explained by an interplay of self-absorbed synchrotron emission up to some distance along the jet and optically thin synchrotron at larger distances (Blandford &amp; Konigl 1979). Their spatial structure is usually studied using core shifts, in which the position of the peak (core) of the emission depends on the frequency. Here, we propose a novel method to fit the spatial dependence of the flux density at a given frequency of the jet and counterjet (when observed) using the theoretical spatial dependencies, which we provide as simple analytical formulae. We apply our method to the spatial structure of the jets in the luminous hard spectral state of the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8--1613. It was the most resolved continuous jet from an X-ray binary ever observed. We find that the observed approaching jet is significantly intrinsically stronger than the receding one, which we attribute to an increase in the emission of both jets with time (observationally confirmed), together with the light travel effect, causing the receding jet to be observed at an earlier epoch than the approaching one. The jets are relatively slow, with the velocity $\sim(0.3$--$0.4)c$. Our findings imply that the magnetic field strength increased with time. Also, the magnetic flux is much lower than in jets launched by `Magnetically Arrested Disks'. Our method is general, and we propose that it be applied to jets launched by stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>How black hole mimickers and Shapiro-free lenses signal effective dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of two exotic compact objects in the leading relativistic model of modified Newtonian dynamics, namely aether-scalar-tensor theory. This model is consistent with precision cosmology and gravitational wave constraints on tensor speed. Black hole mimickers could subtly change observations: gravitational waves from their mergers might show unusual echoes or altered ringdown patterns, and images of their horizon-scale shadows might be slightly different from those of a true black hole. Shapiro-free lenses are massless objects that deflect light without any gravitational time delay, producing distinctive lensing events. These predictions connect to ongoing and future gravitational-wave searches, horizon-scale imaging, and time-domain lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Implications of the KM3NeT Ultrahigh-energy Event on Neutrino Self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions ({\nu}SI) mediated by light bosonic particles can produce characteristic spectral dips in astrophysical neutrino fluxes, thereby modifying the expected energy spectrum. The high-energy astrophysical neutrino spectrum has been extensively used to probe {\nu}SI models through these distinctive features. The recent detection of the ultrahigh-energy event KM3-230213A offers a new opportunity to explore {\nu}SI phenomenology at extreme energies. In this work, we investigate two implications of this observation under the assumption that the event originates from a diffuse power-law spectrum. First, we find that {\nu}SI induces spectral distortions that can mildly alleviate tensions between the KM3-230213A detection and the previous non-observation of PeV-scale neutrinos in IceCube data. Second, we derive new constraints on the {\nu}SI coupling strength for mediator masses around 100 MeV. Our analysis shows that neutrino telescopes can surpass existing collider constraints in this mass range. In the near future, IceCube-Gen2 is expected to substantially enhance the sensitivity to {\nu}SI over a broader range of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Speed Limit and Entanglement in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

Abstract: We model the light HESS J1731-347 compact object (of known stellar mass and radius) within Einstein's General Relativity imposing the Karmarkar condition in gravity for anisotropic stars. The three free parameters of the analytic solution are determined imposing the matching conditions at the surface of the star for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that the solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. Furthermore, we study the radial oscillation modes, and we compare to the ones corresponding to an isotropic star modeled by the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. A comparison between the large frequency separations is made as well.</description>

      <title>Evolution of precessing binary black holes on eccentric orbits using orbit-averaged evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most general bound binary black hole (BBH) system has an eccentric orbit and precessing spins. The detection of such a system with significant eccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical formation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve their spins and eccentricity from the larger separations at which the binary formed to the smaller separations at which it is detected, or vice versa. Knowledge of the precessional evolution of the binary's orbital angular momentum can also be used to twist up aligned-spin eccentric waveform models to create a spin-precessing eccentric waveform model. In this paper, we present a new publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessing BBHs using orbit-averaged post-Newtonian (PN) equations from the literature. The spin-precession dynamics is 2PN accurate, i.e., with the leading spin-orbit and spin-spin corrections. The evolution of orbital parameters (orbital frequency, eccentricity, and periastron precession), which follow the quasi-Keplerian parametrization, is 3PN accurate in the point particle terms and includes the leading order spin-orbit and spin-spin effects. All the spin-spin terms include the quadrupole-monopole interaction. The eccentricity enhancement functions in the fluxes use the high-accuracy hyperasymptotic expansions from Loutrel and Yunes [Classical Quantum Gravity {\bf 34} 044003 (2017)]. We discuss various features of the code and study the evolution of the orbital and spin-precession parameters of eccentric, precessing BBHs. In particular, we study the dependence of the spin morphologies on eccentricity, where we find that the transition point from one spin morphology to another can depend nonmonotonically on eccentricity, and the fraction of binaries in a given morphology at a given point in the evolution of a population depends on the instantaneous eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Two Decades of Dust Evolution in SN 2005af through JWST, Spitzer, and Chemical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the ejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 Msun, while in the circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is 0.001-0.004 Msun.</description>

      <title>Is the Symbiotic Recurrent Nova T CrB Late? Recent Photometric Evolution and Comparison with Past Pre-Outburst Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T CrB is a symbiotic recurrent nova that last erupted in 1946. Given its recurrence timescale of approximately 80 years, the next outburst is eagerly anticipated by the astronomical community. In this work, we analyse the optical light curves of T CrB, comparing recent photometric evolution with historical data to evaluate potential predictive indicators of nova eruptions. Although the "super-active" phases preceding both the 1946 and anticipated eruptions are strikingly similar, the subsequent photometric behaviour differs. We find that the decline in brightness observed in 2023, interpreted by some as a "pre-eruption dip", deviates from the deep minimum recorded prior to the 1946 event and does not reliably predict the eruption timing. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations indicate that the system is returning to a high-accretion state. Given this, an eruption may be imminent, even without distinct precursors. While the next eruption of T CrB will be a major scientific event, its expected peak brightness of $V \sim 2$ mag highlights the importance of setting realistic public expectations for what will be a visually modest, yet astrophysically very significant, celestial event.</description>

      <title>Chaos Around the Kerr Black Hole: its Effects on Entropy and the Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit chaotic motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. In both of these cases, chaotic motion causes information production. In the case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that this information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we extend this method to obtain more precise results by including the non-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. In the other case of massive particles that plunge into the Kerr black hole, we show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and that it obeys Bekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical material system. Thus, the perturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the observer's screen, have physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Radio Pulsar Emission-Beam Geometry at Low Frequency: LOFAR High Band Survey Sources Studied using Arecibo at 1.4 GHz and 327 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues our study of radio pulsar emission-beam configurations with the primary intent of extending study to the lowest possible frequencies. Here we focus on a group of 133 more recently discovered pulsars, most of which were included in the (100-200 MHz) LOFAR High Band Survey, observed with Arecibo at 1.4 GHz and 327 MHz, and some observed at decameter wavelengths. Our analysis framework is the core/double-cone beam model, and we took opportunity to apply it as widely as possible, both conceptually and quantitatively, while highlighting situations where modeling is difficult, or where its premises may be violated. In the great majority of pulsars, beam forms consistent with the core/double-cone model were identified. Moreover, we found that each pulsar's beam structure remained largely constant over the frequency range available; where profile variations were observed, they were attributable to different component spectra and in some instances to varying conal beam sizes. As an Arecibo population, many or most of the objects tend to fall in the Galactic anticenter region and/or at high Galactic latitudes, so overall it includes a number of nearer, older pulsars. We found a number of interesting or unusual characteristics in some of the pulsars that would benefit from additional study. The scattering levels encountered for this group are low to moderate, apart from a few pulsars lying in directions more toward the inner Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the energy distribution and formation rate of CHIME fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the first CHIME/FRB catalogue, three volume-limited samples of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are built, with samples 1, 2, and 3 corresponding to a fluence cut of 5, 3, and 1, respectively. The Lynden-Bell's c$^-$ method was applied to study their energy function and event rate evolution with redshift ($z$). Using the non-parametric Kendall's $\tau$ statistics, it is found that the FRB energy ($E$) strongly evolves with redshift as $E(z)\varpropto(1+z)^{1.24}$ for sample 1, $E(z)\varpropto(1+z)^{0.98}$ for sample 2, and $E(z)\varpropto(1+z)^{1.99}$ for sample 3. After removing the redshift dependence, the local energy distributions of the three samples can be well described by a broken power-law form with a broken energy of $\sim10^{40} \rm erg$. Meanwhile, the redshift distributions of samples 1 and 2 are identical but different from that of sample 3. Interestingly, we find that the event rates of samples 1 and 2 are independent of redshift, and sample 3 decreases as a single power-law form with an index of -2.41. The local event rates of the three samples of CHIME FRBs are found to be consistently close to $\sim 10^4\rm{\,Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, which is comparable with some previous estimates. In addition, we notice that the event rate of sample 3 FRBs with lower energies not only exceeds the star formation rate at the lower redshifts but also always declines with the increase in redshift. We suggest that the excess of FRB rates compared with the star formation rate at low redshift mainly results from the low-energy FRBs that could originate in the older stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Tracking the jet-like corona of black hole Swift J1727.8-1613 during a flare state through Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in black hole X-ray transients typically manifest in the low-hard and hard-intermediate states. This study presents a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of the black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 using NICER observations from August and September 2023, with a focus on the first flare period. We detected Type-C QPOs whose centroid frequency increased from 0.33 Hz to 2.63 Hz. An additional increase in frequency was observed when the outburst entered a flare period. The time-averaged spectra, along with the rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPOs, were jointly fitted using the time-dependent Comptonization model vkompthdk to examine the geometry of the corona during this flare. Correlations between spectral and temporal properties suggest that the detected type-C QPOs are primarily modulated by Lense-Thirring precession. Leveraging simultaneous radio observations that indicate discrete jet ejections, we proposed a scenario to describe the co-evolution of the disk-corona-jet during a flare (~3 days). This scenario is partially supported for the first time by polarization data in the soft gamma-ray band from INTEGRAL/IBIS. A phenomenological analysis of the corona scenario was also conducted.</description>

      <title>Polarization Characteristics of the Hyperactive FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio bursts of extragalactic origin characterized by millisecond durations and high luminosities. We report on observations of FRB 20240114A conducted with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at frequencies ranging from 720 to 920 MHz. A total of 437 bursts were detected, with a single observation recording 365 bursts over 1.38 hours, corresponding to a burst rate of 264 bursts per hour. The average rotation measures (RMs) were $347.0 \pm 1.0$ rad m$^{-2}$ on February 23, 2024, and $353.7 \pm 0.6$ rad m$^{-2}$ on March 1, 2024. Of the 301 bursts with detected RMs, 81% have a linear polarization fraction greater than 90%, and 14% exhibit circular polarization with a signal-to-noise ratio $&gt; 5$. Our sample also displayed polarization angle swings. We compared the linear polarization fraction of FRB~20240114A with those of the repeating sources FRB~20201124A and FRB~20220912A. Our analysis reveals that all three exhibit similar distributions in both linear and circular polarization fractions. These results indicate that the three sources share the same radiation mechanism. We analyze the fluence and waiting-time distributions of FRB~20240114A, revealing a right-skewed fluence distribution and a bimodal waiting-time structure, suggesting intrinsic emission timescales and potential multiple burst populations. Additionally, We present a novel method to determine the frequency range of bursts based on their spectral characteristics. This algorithm is independent of spectral models and remains unaffected by the removal of interference-affected channels in the data, ensuring robust performance.</description>

      <title>Stellar Tidal Disruptions by Newborn Neutron Stars or Black Holes: A Mechanism for Hydrogen-poor (Super)luminous Supernovae and Fast Blue Optical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) of Type Ibc are explosions of massive stars that lost their hydrogen envelopes, typically due to interactions with a binary companion. We consider the case where the natal kick imparted to the neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) remnant brings the compact object to a collision with a main-sequence companion, eventually leading to full tidal disruption of the companion. Subsequently, super-Eddington accretion onto the NS/BH launches a powerful, fast wind which collides with the SN ejecta and efficiently converts the kinetic energy of the wind into radiation. The radiation is reprocessed by the surrounding ejecta into a luminous ($\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak), days to months-long transient with optical peaks from $-19$ to $-21$ mag, comparable to (super)luminous Type Ibc SNe and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) like AT2018cow. From a Monte-Carlo analysis we estimate the fraction of tidal disruptions following SNe in binaries to be $\sim 0.1$--$1$\%, roughly compatible with the event rates of these luminous SNe. At the broad-brush level, our model reproduces the multi-wavelength and spectral observations of FBOTs, and has the potential to explain peculiar features seen in some (super)luminous SNe which are difficult to reproduce by the conventional magnetar spindown mechanism, such as late-time hydrogen lines, bumpy light curves, and pre-peak excess.</description>

      <title>The properties of GSN 069 accretion disk from a joint X-ray and UV spectral analysis: stress-testing quasi-periodic eruption models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and XMM-Newton data of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069. Using ultraviolet (UV) and optical images at HST resolution, we show that GSN 069's emission consists of a point source superimposed on a diffuse stellar component. The latter accounts for $\leq 5\%$ of the UV emission in the inner 0.5"$\times$0.5" region, while the luminosity of the former cannot be attributed to stars. Analyzing the 2014/2018 \hst UV spectra, we show that to leading order the intrinsic spectral shape is $\nu\,L_{\nu}\propto\nu^{4/3}$, with $\sim10\%$ far UV flux variability between epochs. The contemporaneous X-ray and UV spectra can be modeled self-consistently in a thin disk framework. At observed epochs, the disk had an outer radius ($R_{\rm out}$) of $\mathcal{O}(10^3R_{\rm g})$, showing both cooling and expansion over four years. Incorporating relativistic effects via numerical ray tracing, we constrain the disk inclination angle ($i$) to be $30^\circ\,\lesssim\,i\,\lesssim\,65^\circ$ and identify a narrow region of spin-inclination parameter space that describes the observations. These findings confirm that GSN 069 hosts a compact, viscously expanding accretion disk likely formed after a TDE. Implications for QPE models are: (i) No published disk instability model can explain the disk's stability in 2014 (no QPEs) and its instability in 2018 (QPEs present); (ii) While the disk size in 2018 allows for orbiter/disk interactions to produce QPEs, in 2014 the disk was already sufficiently extended, yet no QPEs were present. These findings pose challenges to existing QPE models.</description>

Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>WR + O binaries as probes of the first phase of mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Wolf-Rayet (WR) and O-star binaries can be the progenitors of X-ray binaries and double black hole binaries. Their formation is not yet fully understood, however. For 21 observed WR+O systems, we aim to infer whether the mass transfer started on the main sequence (Case A) or later (Case B). We also calculated (limits on) the mass-transfer efficiency {\beta}, that is, the fraction of transferred mass that is accreted, and the parameter {\gamma}, which denotes the fraction of angular momentum of the binary that is lost per unit mass in units of the average angular momentum of the binary per unit mass. Aims. We inferred the possible values for the initial masses based on the observed WR masses and models for WR from the literature. With these initial primary masses, we created a grid of possible periods and secondary masses for which we determined the values that {\beta} and {\gamma} would have taken for either Case A or Case B mass transfer. Based on this, we also determined the case of mass transfer that is most likely for each system. Methods. Taking into account the progenitor distribution of WR+O binaries, we find that highly non-conservative Case A mass transfer seems to be the most likely scenario for the majority of systems as this can explain 14 out of 21 systems. The angular momentum loss is likely relatively high (typically {\gamma} &gt; 1). Our finding that most systems in our sample experienced Case A mass transfer contradicts the expectation that most massive binaries go through Case B mass transfer. This suggests that post-case-B systems are significantly underrepresented in the observed WR+O binary population, either intrinsically or due to severe selection effects.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: Hyperbolicity, causality, and stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a first-order theory of relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame, which is similar to Eckart's frame except that the temperature is determined by fixing the trace of the stress-energy tensor. Our theory is hyperbolic and causal provided a single inequality holds. For low wave numbers, the expected damped modes in the shear, acoustic, and heat diffusion channels are recovered. Stability of global equilibria with respect to all wave numbers is also analyzed. The conditions for hyperbolicity, causality and stability are satisfied for a simple gas of hard spheres or disks.</description>
