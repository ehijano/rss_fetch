      <title>Theoretical Insights into Layered Metamaterials with Enhanced Thermal and Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent trade-off between ultra-low thermal conductivity and high mechanical rigidity in natural materials limits their utility in advanced applications. Inspired by the unique architecture of layered honeycomb structures, this study introduces a new class of metamaterials designed to overcome these constraints. By systematically exploring unit cell configurations and stacking arrangements, we demonstrate that a zigzag internal geometry, analogous to rhombohedral graphene stacking, optimizes thermal insulation while maintaining relatively high mechanical rigidity. Our finite element simulations predict that these layered structures can achieve a thermal conductivity of 12.5 mW/(m.K) using zirconia as the constructing material, theoretically outperforming state-of-the-art ceramic aerogels while maintaining robust mechanical stability. This novel approach paves the way for designing next-generation super-insulating materials with customizable mechanical properties, enabling innovative applications in extreme environments, lightweight aerospace structures, and advanced thermal management systems.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Phase Shifts in Spatiotemporally Modulated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials and devices subject to spatiotemporal modulation of their effective properties have a demonstrated ability to support nonreciprocal transmission of waves. Most notably, spatiotemporally modulated systems can restrict wave transmission to only one direction; i.e. a very large difference in the energy transmitted between two points in opposite directions. Taking on a different perspective on nonreciprocity, we here present a response regime in spatiotemporally modulated systems that is characterized by equal transmitted amplitudes (energies) but different phases. The only contributor to nonreciprocity is therefore the nonreciprocal phase shift, the difference between the transmitted phases in the opposite directions. We develop a methodology for realization of nonreciprocal phase shifts based on the response envelopes. This includes a formulation that ensures the same transmitted waveform, along with a special case of near-reciprocal transmission. We focus primarily on steady-state vibration transmission in short, weakly modulated systems, but include a special case of nonreciprocal phase shifts for systems with arbitrary length and strength of modulation. We discuss the main limitations of our methodology, as well as a pathway to overcome it, to motivate further developments on strongly modulated systems. While showcasing a new way for controlling vibration information transmission, our findings highlight the potential role of phase as an additional parameter in nonreciprocal transmission in spatiotemporally modulated systems.</description>

      <title>Low-profile Aperiodic Metasurfaces for High-efficiency Achromatic Anomalous Reflection over a Wide Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface anomalous reflectors can enhance future wireless communication systems due to their ability to redirect electromagnetic waves and establish metasurface-assisted communication links. However, metasurface reflectors typically suffer from chromatic aberrations with the reflected angle shifting as the frequency varies. Herein, we design achromatic metasurfaces for anomalous reflection by using an integral-equation framework that fully accounts for the frequency dispersion of the individual scatterers (unit cells). Rather than engineering the dispersion of each metasurface cell locally, we harness the emerging near-field interactions (evanescent waves) between the scatterers to realize anomalous reflection at a fixed angle over a wide frequency range. Three anomalous reflectors are designed and experimentally verified at 10GHz, demonstrating high performance metrics compared to traditional achromatic reflectors, while employing simple, low-profile unit cells. The presented results pave an effective way to realize achromatic wave functionalities, such as anomalous reflection, refraction or lensing, over a wide bandwidth with low-profile and highly efficient metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Measuring direct flexoelectricity at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity is a property of all dielectric materials, where inhomogeneous strain induces electrical polarization. This effect becomes particularly prominent at the nanoscale where larger strain gradients can be obtained. While flexoelectric charges have been measured in mm-scale systems, direct measurements in nanoscale-thickness materials have not yet been achieved. Given that one of the most prominent applications of flexoelectricity is in nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS), confirming the presence and magnitude of the effect at these scales is essential. This study presents the first-ever measurements of flexoelectric-generated charges (direct effect) in nanoscale-thickness materials, using cantilevers with a 50 nm hafnium oxide layer. We confirm that the estimated flexoelectric coefficient from said measurements aligns with the values obtained from complementary experiments using the flexoelectric inverse effect. Additionally, by changing the cantilever geometry (modifying the width of the cantilevers), we demonstrate a 40% increase in the effective flexoelectric coefficient, explained by the interplay of different flexoelectric tensor components. These findings not only validate the presence of flexoelectric effects at the nanoscale but also open the possibility for full flexoelectric transduction of the motion in NEMS/MEMS devices.</description>

      <title>Review on spin-wave RF applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the progress of spin-wave technology, emphasizing magnonics as a potential solution to modern challenges in radio frequency (RF) communication systems. To ensure clarity, the first two sections of the review reiterate premises of the magnonics, outline key milestones in spin-wave research, briefly review the state-of-the-art for technology and materials, as well as highlight potential directions for future developments. The third section is dedicated to spin-wave RF applications developed over the past 50 years, focusing on selected passive fundamental devices (filters, power limiters, delay lines, phase shifters, directional couplers, resonators, etc) and their operating principles. In the last section, the review further discusses the main advantages of spin-waves for RF applications while highlighting potential concerns, such as insertion losses, linearity and power capacity. Finally, potential solutions to address these challenges are proposed.</description>

      <title>A frequency tunable low-noise YIG-GGG based oscillator with strong magneto-elastic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a frequency tunable magneto-acoustic oscillator (MAO) operating in low-phase-noise and complex dynamical regimes based on a single composite YIG-GGG resonator. The magneto-acoustic resonator (MAR) is based on a YIG (yttrium iron garnet) layer epitaxially grown on a GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) substrate. By optimizing the YIG thickness, we obtain a high magneto-elastic coupling of around 1 MHz between the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in YIG and high overtone acoustic resonances (HBARs) in the YIG-GGG structure in the 1-2 GHz frequency range. It allows to eliminate the need for pre-selectors and bulky circulators, thus simplifying the MAO design while maintaining the possibility to lock to HBAR YIG-GGG modes. With an adjustment in the loop over-amplification parameter, the MAO can be locked either only to high-Q magneto-acoustic HBARs or to both types of resonance including HBARs and the FMR mode of the YIG film. In a low-phase-noise regime, MAO generates only at certain values of the applied field and exhibits discrete frequency tunability with a 3.281 MHz step corresponding to the frequency separation between the adjacent HBAR modes in a YIG-GGG structure. In a complex regime where oscillation conditions expand to include both HBAR and FMR modes, MAO demonstrates continuous generation as the function of the applied field with variable phase noise parameters. Moreover, in low-phase-noise regime, MAO phase noise plot improves by 30 dB compared to the operational regime locked to the pure FMR in YIG which is in agreement with the measured FMR and HBAR Q-factors.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion imaging of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 50 nW/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a high-resolution upconversion imaging system that converts low-intensity (down to 50 nW/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. The upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Responsivity and Stability of Nonlinear Exceptional Point Lasers with Saturable Gain and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The responsivity of perturbation sensing can be effectively enhanced by using higher-order exceptional points (HOEPs) due to their nonlinear response to frequency perturbations. However, experimental realization can be difficult due to the stringent parameter conditions associated with these points. In this work, we study an EP laser composed of two coupled nonlinear resonators that uses nonlinearity to simplify these tuning requirements. This system demonstrates a distinct cube-root response in the steady-state lasing frequency, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the distribution of linear and saturable gain and loss. This design freedom enables several orders of magnitude higher responsivity than systems with a single nonlinear resonator, which have been previously explored. Maximizing responsivity also improves the robustness of sensing performance against parametric errors. These features are derived from coupled mode theory and further supported by steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) results at several nonlinear EPs. Through linear stability analysis, we also identify regions of instability within the class-A regime that arise due to mode competition, which can be induced by asymmetric passive losses. In the class-B regime, we show that the interplay between gain dynamics and detuning can lead to restabilization at slow relaxation rates or higher inter-resonator coupling rates. This regime could be used to increase the maximum achievable responsivity of the system.</description>

      <title>Diamine Surface Passivation and Post-Annealing Enhance Performance of Silicon-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the use of 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) as a chemical modifier at the perovskite/electron-transport layer (ETL) interface enhances the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.7 eV bandgap FACs mixed-halide perovskite single-junction cells, primarily by boosting the open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.06 V to 1.15 V. Adding a post-processing annealing step after C60 evaporation, further improves the fill factor (FF) by 20% from the control to the DAP + post-annealing devices. Using hyperspectral photoluminescence microscopy, we demonstrate that annealing helps improve compositional homogeneity at the top and bottom interfaces of the solar cell, which prevents detrimental bandgap pinning in the devices and improves C60 adhesion. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we show that DAP reacts with formamidinium present near the surface of the perovskite lattice to form a larger molecular cation, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidinium (THP) that remains at the interface. Combining the use of DAP and the annealing of C60 interface, we fabricate Si-perovskite tandems with PCE of 25.29%, compared to 23.26% for control devices. Our study underscores the critical role of chemical reactivity and thermal post-processing of the C60/Lewis-base passivator interface in minimizing device losses and advancing solar-cell performance of wide-bandgap mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite for tandem application.</description>

      <title>Monolithic piezoelectrically tunable hybrid integrated laser with sub-fiber laser coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low noise lasers are essential tools in a wide variety of applications, including data communication, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), quantum computing and sensing, and optical metrology. Recent advances in integrated photonics, specifically the development of ultra-low loss silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) platform, have allowed attaining performance that exceeds conventional legacy laser systems, including the phase noise of fiber lasers. This platform can moreover be combined with monolithic integration of piezoelectrical materials, enabling frequency agile low noise lasers. However, this approach has to date not surpassed the trade-off between ultra-low frequency noise and frequency agility. Here we overcome this challenge and demonstrate a fully integrated laser based on the Si$_3$N$_4$ platform with frequency noise lower than that of a fiber laser, while maintaining the capability for high-speed modulation of the laser frequency. The laser achieves an output power of 30 mW with an integrated linewidth of 4.3 kHz and an intrinsic linewidth of 3 Hz, demonstrating phase noise performance that is on par with or lower than commercial fiber lasers. Frequency agility is accomplished via a monolithically integrated piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) actuator, which enables a flat frequency actuation bandwidth extending up to 400 kHz. This combination of ultra-low noise and frequency agility is a useful feature enabling tight laser locking for frequency metrology, fiber sensing, and coherent sensing applications. Our results demonstrate the ability of 'next generation' integrated photonic circuits (beyond silicon) to exceed the performance of legacy laser systems in terms of coherence and frequency actuation.</description>

      <title>Memristive Nanowire Network for Energy Efficient Audio Classification: Pre-Processing-Free Reservoir Computing with Reduced Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition is a key challenge in natural language processing, requiring low latency, efficient computation, and strong generalization for real-time applications. While software-based artificial neural networks (ANNs) excel at this task, they are computationally intensive and depend heavily on data pre-processing. Neuromorphic computing, with its low-latency and energy-efficient advantages, holds promise for audio classification. Memristive nanowire networks, combined with pre-processing techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient extraction, have been widely used for associative learning, but such pre-processing can be power-intensive, undermining latency benefits. This study pioneers the use of memristive and spatio-temporal properties of nanowire networks for audio signal classification without pre-processing. A nanowire network simulation is paired with three linear classifiers for 10-class MNIST audio classification and binary speaker generalization tests. The hybrid system achieves significant benefits: excellent data compression with only 3% of nanowire output utilized, a 10-fold reduction in computational latency, and up to 28.5% improved classification accuracy (using a logistic regression classifier). Precision and recall improve by 10% and 17% for multispeaker datasets, and by 24% and 17% for individual speaker datasets, compared to raw data classifiers.This work provides a foundational proof of concept for utilizing memristive nanowire networks (NWN) in edge-computing devices, showcasing their potential for efficient, real-time audio signal processing with reduced computational overhead and power consumption, and enabling the development of advanced neuromorphic computing solutions.</description>

      <title>Alternative sum rules and waterbed effects of Lorentz resonator system for sound absorption and transmission in a unidimensional waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fundamental constraints on passive linear time-invariant acoustic systems through the developing alternative linear sum rules for sound absorption and transmission. Our approach, based on the Herglotz function method, yields integral identities without non-linear logarithmic terms or frequency weightings, providing clearer physical insights into system performance limits. The study focuses on unidimensional waveguides with Lorentz resonators, encompassing various practical acoustic structures. The developed sum rules are found to be particularly effective in predicting constraints on the average sound absorption coefficient for broadband absorbers operating in deep-subwavelength structures. Based on these rules, we demonstrate the waterbed effect in such systems, highlighting the inherent compromises between absorption efficiency, bandwidth, and device thickness. Through case studies of resonator arrays and membranes, we illustrate the practical implications of these new sum rules for designing optimal sound absorbers and isolators. The work concludes with a discussion on the challenges and future prospects in passive noise control, suggesting potential pathways to surpass current performance boundaries.</description>

      <title>Emulating time interfaces via smooth temporal transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of time as a new degree of freedom to control wave-matter interactions have opened new avenues to fully control wave propagation in four dimensions (x,y,z,t). Time interfaces (rapid changes of the constitutive relations of the medium where a wave propagates) have recently become popular as they are the temporal analogue of spatial interfaces. While recent groundbreaking experimental work has demonstrated time interfaces from water waves, microwaves and the optical regime, rapidly changing, for instance, the permittivity of the medium requires carefully engineered structures. Here, we study the possibility of implementing smooth temporal transitions of the refractive index of the medium in order to mimic the response of time interfaces via adiabatic modulations. It is shown that indeed, as long as the signal is inside the structure during the modulation time, there are some values of rising/falling time of the adiabatic modulation that enables a full approximate emulation of a time interface. These results may open further avenues to explore by relaxing the speed at which the time-modulation should be introduced when designing four-dimensional media.</description>

      <title>Nanostructured micrometric-pore membranes for nanofiltration: Micrometric geometry may optimize performance, energy efficiency and operational lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Media and membranes composed of micrometric-diameter pores are well known in academia and industry to be capable of efficacious nanofiltration of fluids once the pore inner surfaces are coated with nanostructures. Given the large mismatch between the two very different scales of these hybrid systems, it could be expected that trapping of nanoimpurities would almost entirely depend on the characteristics of the nanostructures. However, we show here that the micrometric-scale nominal geometry does have noticeable impact on the nanofiltration performance, on its evolution with time, and on the energy spent per trapped impurity. For that, we apply stochastic calculations customized to combine the cumulative probabilities of wall-impurity attraction and binding, supplemented with continuity equations as the fluid flows; this allows tracking the nanofiltration without a many-particle simulation, prohibitive in such multi-scale system. We focus on the influence of the micrometric nominal geometry over filtration features like logarithmic removal value LRV, operational lifetimes, energy balances, or spatial profiles of the trapped-impurity layer in the pore inner walls. Our results identify some pore geometries (e.g., decreasing-conical and sinusoidal-corrugated) with about 4-fold larger initial nanofiltering performance and operational lifetime than simple cylinders of the same average diameter. The optimal geometry is also shown to depend on the LRV value acceptable for each specific application.</description>

      <title>Efficiency Enhancement of c-Si/TiO$_2$ Heterojunction Thin Film Solar Cell Using Hybrid Metal-Dielectric Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid metal-dielectric nanostructures (HMDN) are promising candidates to address the ohmic loss by conventional nanostructures in photovoltaic applications by strong confinement and high scattering directivity. In this study, we present a c-Si/TiO$_2$ heterojunction thin film solar cell (TFSC) where a pair of triangular HMDN comprised of Ag and AZO was utilized to enhance the longer wavelength light absorption. The presence of the TiO$_2$ inverted pyramid layer, in combination with the ITO and SiO$_2$-based pyramid layers at the front, enhanced the shorter wavelength light absorption by increasing the optical path and facilitating the coupling of incoming light in photonic mode. Consequently, the average absorption by 1000 nm thick photoactive layer reached 83.32 % for AM 1.5G within the wavelength range of 300 - 1100 nm which was investigated by employing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The electric field profile and current density profile demonstrated the respective contributions of each layer in the absorption of light at shorter and longer wavelengths. The structure exhibited a short circuit current density ($J_{sc}$) of 37.96 mA/cm$^2$ and a power conversion efficiency ($PCE$) of 17.42 %. The efficiency of our proposed structure experienced a maximum relative change of 0.34 % when a polarized light was exposed with an angle of 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$. The incorporation of self-heating in non-isothermal conditions reduced $PCE$ by $13.77 \%$. In addition, the comparative analysis to assess the impact of HMDN on our structure revealed a $4.54 \%$ increase in $PCE$ of the structure with metallic nanostructures, paving the way for the utilization of HMDN to enhance the performance of TFSC.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Impact of Magnetic Fields on Scattering Muography Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muography is a non-invasive imaging technique that exploits cosmic-ray muons to probe various targets by analyzing the absorption or scattering of muons. The method is particularly useful for applications ranging from geophysical exploration to security screening, including the identification of nuclear materials. This study leverages both Monte Carlo simulations and the Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) algorithm for image reconstruction to specifically explore the distortions caused by magnetic fields in scattering muography images. In the PoCA algorithm, it is assumed that all scattering of a muon during its travel in material occurs at a single point, known as the PoCA point. Each PoCA point is characterized by a scattering angle, whose distribution provides insights into the density and elemental composition of the target material. However, magnetic fields can influence muon trajectories according to Lorentz law, affecting the estimated positions of the PoCA points and the calculated scattering angles. This introduces challenges in applications such as border security control systems. Moreover, the presence of magnetic fields can lead to what we term "magnetic jamming", where the resulting muography image is distorted or misleading. This effect further complicates the accurate identification and interpretation of target materials. Our findings underline the necessity to account for magnetic field distortions when utilizing scattering muography in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Structure, short-range order, and phase stability of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy: Insights from a perturbative, DFT-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or $\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases. These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering tendencies in these intriguing materials.</description>

      <title>Fracture and size effect in mechanical metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resort to variational methods to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of fine metamaterials as a function of cell size. To zeroth order, the metamaterial behaves as a micropolar continuum with both displacement and rotation degrees of freedom, but exhibits linear-elastic fracture mechanics scaling and therefore no size effect. To higher order, the overall energetics of the metastructure can be characterized explicitly in terms of the solution of the zeroth-order continuum problem by the method of {\Gamma}-expansion. We present explicit expressions of the second-order correction for octet frames. As an application, we evaluate the compliance of double-cantilever octet specimens to second order and use the result to elucidate the dependence of the apparent toughness of the specimen on cell size. The analysis predicts the discreteness of the metamaterial lattice to effectively shield the crack-tip, a mechanism that we term lattice shielding. The theory specifically predicts anti-shielding, i. e., coarser is weaker, in agreement with recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-Agnostic Metasurface Design for Next-Generation 2D Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a versatile technique for inverse designing 2D photonic crystal metasurfaces. These surfaces, known for their ability to manipulate light-matter interactions, can be precisely controlled to achieve specific functionalities. The key lies in efficiently optimizing the geometric patterns and dimensions of the metasurface. Through a composite method which exploits two well-established paradigms - Covariance Matrix Adaptation optimization and Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), we demonstrate our ability to design and optimize resonances in metaelements to achieve desired optical performance such as near-perfect absorption at chosen wavelengths/optical modes, which otherwise proves to be challenging or even impossible with conventional inverse design implementations. We apply our method to design three-layered structures involving a monolayer absorber, transparent metasubstrate, and a back mirror to get near 100% absorption at one or two chosen wavelengths. For illustration, we choose black phosphorus and silicon metasurface to predict ~100% absorption in a monolayer at 1550 nm. The versatile technique can be applied to tailor reflectance and transmittance for any optical mode and wavelength. This computationally efficient design method paves the way for creating high-performance 2D metasurface-based devices with a variety of applications, including quantum technology components such as single photon sensors and biphoton sources, communication systems, and non-linear light conversion.</description>

      <title>Programmable multifunctional integrated microwave photonic circuit on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave photonics, with its advanced high-frequency signal processing capabilities, is expected to play a crucial role in next-generation wireless communications and radar systems. The realization of highly integrated, high-performance, and multifunctional microwave photonic links will pave the way for its widespread deployment in practical applications, which is a significant challenge. Here, leveraging thin-film lithium niobate intensity modulator and programmable cascaded microring resonators, we demonstrate for the first time a tunable microwave photonic notch filter that simultaneously achieves high level of integration along with high dynamic range, high link gain, low noise figure, and ultra-high rejection ratio. Additionally, this programmable on-chip system is multifunctional, allowing for the dual-band notch filter and the suppression of the high-power interference signal. This work demonstrates the potential applications of the thin-film lithium niobate platform in the field of high-performance integrated microwave photonic filtering and signal processing, facilitating the advancement of microwave photonic system towards practical applications.</description>

      <title>High order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of differential-algebraic systems of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical method ADER-DG with a local DG predictor for solving a DAE system has been developed, which was based on the formulation of ADER-DG methods using a local DG predictor for solving ODE and PDE systems. The basis functions were chosen in the form of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials, which differs from the classical formulations of the ADER-DG method, where it is customary to use the roots of Legendre polynomials. It was shown that the use of this basis leads to A-stability and L1-stability in the case of using the DAE solver as ODE solver. The numerical method ADER-DG allows one to obtain a highly accurate numerical solution even on very coarse grids, with a step greater than the main characteristic scale of solution variation. The local discrete time solution can be used as a numerical solution of the DAE system between grid nodes, thereby providing subgrid resolution even in the case of very coarse grids. The classical test examples were solved by developed numerical method ADER-DG. With increasing index of the DAE system, a decrease in the empirical convergence orders p is observed. An unexpected result was obtained in the numerical solution of the stiff DAE system -- the empirical convergence orders of the numerical solution obtained using the developed method turned out to be significantly higher than the values expected for this method in the case of stiff problems. It turns out that the use of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials is much better suited for solving stiff problems. Estimates showed that the computational costs of the ADER-DG method are approximately comparable to the computational costs of implicit Runge-Kutta methods used to solve DAE systems. Methods were proposed to reduce the computational costs of the ADER-DG method.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>
