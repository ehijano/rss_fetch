      <title>Non-universality for Crossword Puzzle Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A percolation model inspired by crossword puzzle games is introduced. A game proceeds by solving words, which are segments of sites in a two-dimensional lattice. As test case, the \emph{iid} variant allows for independently occupying sites with letters, only the percolation criterion depends on the existence of solved words. For the \emph{game} variant, inspired by real crossword puzzles, it becomes more likely to solve crossing words which share sites with the already solved words. In this way avalanches of solved words may occur. Both model variants exhibit a percolation transition as function of the a-priori site or word solving probability, respectively. The \emph{iid} variant is in the universality class of standard two-dimensional percolation. The \emph{game} variant exhibits a non-universal critical exponent $\nu$ of the correlation length. The actual value of $\nu$ depends on the function which controls how much solved words accelerate the solved of crossing words.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement dynamics following a quantum quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multipartite entanglement after quenches from initial states which generate multiplets of quasiparticle excitations beyond the usual pair structure. We focus on the dynamics of tripartite entanglement through the lens of the Markov gap -- a computable quantity that signals irreducible tripartite entanglement when positive. In the XX spin chain, we show that the Markov gap is positive at intermediate times, implying the presence of tripartite entanglement. After a time delay, the Markov gap increases and then decays at longer times, thus exhibiting an entanglement barrier. We argue that those qualitative features are consistent with an interpretation of the spreading of tripartite entanglement by triplets of tripartite-entangled quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>First return times on sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic Hamiltonians for multimode bosonic systems results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those seen in chaotic systems. Specifically, considering initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in entanglement dynamics and the negative value of tripartite mutual information. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, we find that the spectral form factor exhibits a non-linear ramp and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display a power law growth. These results show that information scrambling, associated with randomness, is a distinct feature from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states of continuous-variable systems that are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>On the infrared limit of the O(3) nonlinear $\sigma$-model at $\theta = \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D nonlinear sigma models with Hermitian symmetric target admit a theta-term, which couples the field theory to the topological charge of its instanton gas. At the special coupling theta = pi, by what is nowadays attributed to a coupling-constant anomaly of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type, such models have a degenerate ground state. Yet, the details of their non-trivial infrared limit have remained open in general. Here we suggest that non-perturbative renormalization group flow into the strong-coupling regime induces strong fluctuations of the theta-parameter, with the consequence that the instanton density is suppressed, the target-space topology effectively altered, and the target-space metric driven off reality and into geometrostasis. Assuming this heuristic scenario and combining it with a Cauchy process of target-space deformation, we present a detailed argument that the O(3) nonlinear sigma model at theta = pi, known to be the effective field theory for critical antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains with large half-integer spin, renormalizes to the conformal field theory of a U(1) boson compactified at a special radius with SU(2) symmetry. A closely related scenario applies to Pruisken's nonlinear sigma model for the integer quantum Hall transition.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in adaptive higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural and human-made complex systems feature group interactions that adapt over time in response to their dynamic states. However, most of the existing adaptive network models fall short of capturing these group dynamics, as they focus solely on pairwise interactions. In this study, we employ adaptive higher-order networks to describe these systems by proposing a general framework incorporating both adaptivity and group interactions. We demonstrate that global synchronization can exist in those complex structures, and we provide the necessary conditions for the emergence of a stable synchronous state. Additionally, we analyzed some relevant settings, and we showed that the necessary condition is strongly related to the master stability equation, allowing to separate the dynamical and structural properties. We illustrate our theoretical findings through examples involving adaptive higher-order networks of coupled generalized Kuramoto oscillators with phase lag. We also show that the interplay of group interactions and adaptive connectivity results in the formation of stability regions that can induce transitions between synchronization and desynchronization</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions from conformal field theory: generalized $\phi^{2n+1}$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $\phi^{2n+1}$ deformations of the generalized free theory in the $\epsilon$ expansion, where the canonical kinetic term is generalized to a higher-derivative version. For $n=1$, we use the conformal multiplet recombination method to determine the leading anomalous dimensions of the fundamental scalar operator $\phi$ and the bilinear composite operators $\mathcal J$. Then we extend the $n=1$ analysis to the Potts model with $S_{N+1}$ symmetry and its higher-derivative generalization, in which $\phi$ is promoted to an $N$-component field. We further examine the Chew-Frautschi plots and their $N$ dependence. However, for each integer $n&gt;1$, the leading anomalous dimensions of $\phi$ and $ \mathcal{J}$ are not fully determined and contain one unconstrained constant, which in the canonical cases can be fixed by the results from the traditional diagrammatic method. In all cases, we verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with crossing symmetry using the analytic bootstrap methods.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the pattern effect in the atmosphere-ocean coupled system through linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy surplus resulting from radiative forcing causes warming of the Earth system. This initial warming drives a myriad of changes including in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), leading to different radiative feedbacks. The relationship between the radiative feedbacks and the pattern of SST changes is referred to as the "pattern effect". The current approach to study the pattern effect relies on diagnosing the response of atmosphere-only models to perturbations in the SST boundary condition. Here, we argue that the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), together with coarse-graining procedures, is a computationally cheap and theoretically grounded alternative to model experiments. We introduce a protocol to study the pattern effect and present its application in a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. By focusing on the coupled dynamics, we unveil the role of the slow ocean component in setting the pattern effect. We present a new "sensitivity map", representing a first, qualitative prediction of the response of the average top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative flux to perturbations in the SST field. We find negative sensitivity throughout the tropics, in contrast to the current understanding of a positive-negative dipole of sensitivity in the tropical Pacific. Considering only the shortest time scales, the response is dominated by the fast atmospheric variability and we recover results in qualitative agreement with the literature. Therefore, the difference between our results and previous studies, largely comes from including the atmosphere-ocean coupling. The framework offers a conceptually novel perspective on the pattern effect: feedbacks in the coupled system are encoded in a temporally and spatially dependent response operator, rather than time-independent maps as for previous studies.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-range order in two dimensions where an order parameter is advected by laminar flows such as rotational, shear, and elongational flows. Under these flows, we analyze an ordered state of the $O(N)$ scalar model in the large-$N$ limit. We show that the stability of the ordered state depends on the flow pattern; shear and elongational flows stabilize the long-range order but rotational flow does not. We discuss the physical mechanism underlying our results by connecting static correlations of fluctuations and their dynamics based on the interaction representation used in quantum mechanics. We find that advective transport induces superdiffusion under shear and elongational flows, thereby stabilizing the long-range order.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical description to relate the universal term to the effective ground-state degeneracy known as the $g$ function in a boundary conformal field theory, and use the renormalization group method to determine its value. We show that the universal contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement. Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no postselections, is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculated the spectral properties of two related families of non-Hermitian free-particle quantum chains with $N$-multispin interactions ($N=2,3,\ldots$). The first family have a $Z(N)$ symmetry and are described by free parafermions. The second one has a $U(1)$ symmetry and are generalizations of $XX$ quantum chains described by free fermions. The eigenspectra of both free-particle families are formed by the combination of the same pseudo-energies. The models have a multicritical point with dynamical critical exponent $z=1$. The finite-size behavior of their eigenspectra, as well as the entanglement properties of their ground state wave function, indicate the models are conformally invariant. The models with open and periodic boundary conditions show quite distinct physics due to their non-Hermiticity. The models defined with open boundaries have a single conformal invariant phase while the $XX$ multispin models show multiple phases with distinct conformal central charges in the periodic case. The critical exponents of the models are calculated for $N=3,4,5$ and $6$.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Oscillator Staging Coordinates for Efficient Path Integral Simulations of Quantum Oscillators and Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaginary-time path integral (PI) is a rigorous tool to compute static properties at finite temperatures. However, the stiff PI internal modes poses a sampling challenge. This is commonly tackled using staging coordinates, in which the free particle (FP) term of the PI action is diagonalized. We introduce novel and simple staging coordinates that diagonalize the entire action of the harmonic oscillator (HO) model, rendering it efficiently applicable to systems with harmonic character, such as quantum oscillators and crystals. The method is not applicable to fluids or systems with imaginary modes. Unlike FP staging, the HO staging provides a unique treatment of the centroid mode. We provide implementation schemes for PIMC and PIMD in NVT ensemble. Sampling efficiency is assessed in terms of precision and accuracy of estimating the energy and heat capacity of a one-dimensional HO and an asymmetric anharmonic oscillator (AO). In PIMC, the HO coordinates propose collective moves that perfectly sample the HO contribution, then (for AO) the anharmonic term is sampled using standard Metropolis method. This results in a high acceptance rate and, hence, high precision, in comparison to the FP staging. In PIMD, the HO coordinates prescribe definitions for the fictitious masses, yielding equal frequencies when applied to HO model. This allows for larger time step sizes relative to standard staging, without affecting accuracy or integrator stability. We also present results using normal mode (NM) coordinates, based on both HO and FP models. While staging and NM coordinates show similar performance (for FP or HO), staging is computationally preferable due to its cheaper scaling with Trotter number. The enhanced sampling of HO coordinates open avenues for efficient estimation of nuclear quantum effects in more complex systems with harmonic character, such as real molecular bonds and quantum crystals.</description>

Abstract: DNA origami is a widely used method to construct nanostructures by self-assembling designed DNA strands. These structures are often used as "pegboards" for templated assembly of proteins, gold nanoparticles, aptamers, and other molecules, with applications ranging from therapeutics and diagnostics to plasmonics and photonics.
  Imaging these structures using AFM or TEM does not capture their full conformation ensemble as they only show their shape flattened on a surface. However, certain conformations of the nanostructure can position guest molecules into distances unaccounted for in their intended design, thus leading to spurious interactions between guest molecules that are designed to be separated. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to capture conformational ensemble of 2D DNA origami tiles and show that introducing single-stranded overhangs, which are typically used for functionalization of the origami with guest molecules, induces a curvature of the tile structure in the bulk. We show that the shape deformation is of entropic origin, with implications for design of robust DNA origami breadboards as well as potential approach to modulate structure shape by introducing overhangs. We then verify experimentally that the DNA overhangs introduce curvature into the DNA origami tiles in divalent as well as monovalent salt buffer conditions. We further experimentally verify that DNA origami functionalized with attached proteins also experience such induced curvature. We provide the developed simulation code implementing the enhanced sampling to characterize conformational space of DNA origami as open source software.</description>

Abstract: Optical refrigeration using anti-Stokes photoluminescence is now well established, especially for rare-earth-doped solids where cooling to cryogenic temperatures has recently been achieved. The cooling efficiency of optical refrigeration is constrained by the requirement that the increase in entropy of the photon field must be greater than the decrease in entropy of the sample. Laser radiation has been used in all demonstrated cases of optical refrigeration with the intention of minimizing the entropy of the absorbed photons. Here, we show that as long as the incident radiation is unidirectional, the loss of coherence does not significantly affect the cooling efficiency. Using a general formulation of radiation entropy as the von Neumann entropy of the photon field, we show how the cooling efficiency depends on the properties of the light source such as wavelength, coherence, and directionality. Our results suggest that the laws of thermodynamics permit optical cooling of materials with incoherent sources such as light emitting diodes and filtered sunlight almost as efficiently as with lasers. Our findings have significant and immediate implications for design of compact, all-solid-state devices cooled via optical refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Generally applicable physics-based equation of state for liquids</title>

Abstract: Physics-based first-principles pressure-volume-temperature equations of state (EOS) exist for solids and gases but not for liquids due to the long-standing fundamental problems involved in liquid theory. Current EOS models that are applicable to liquids and supercritical fluids at liquid-like density under conditions relevant to planetary interiors and industrial processes are complex empirical models with many physically meaningless adjustable parameters. Here, we develop a generally applicable physics-based (GAP) EOS for liquids including supercritical fluids at liquid-like density. The GAP equation is explicit in the internal energy, and hence links the most fundamental macroscopic static property of fluids, the pressure-volume-temperature EOS, to their key microscopic property: the molecular hopping frequency or liquid relaxation time, from which the internal energy can be obtained. We test our GAP equation against available experimental data in several different ways and find good agreement. Our GAP equation, unavoidably and similarly to solid EOS, contains a semi-empirical term giving the energy of the static sample as a function of volume only (E_ST(V)). Our testing includes studies along isochores, in order to examine the validity of the GAP equation independently of the validity of any function we may choose to utilize for E_ST(V). The only other adjustable parameter in the equation is the Gruneisen parameter for the fluid. We observe that the GAP equation is similar to the Mie-Gruneisen solid EOS in a wide range of the liquid phase diagram. This similarity is ultimately related to the condensed state of these two phases. On the other hand, the differences between the GAP equation and EOS for gases are fundamental. Finally, we identify the key gaps in the experimental data that need to be filled in to proceed further with the liquid EOS.</description>

Abstract: The precise control of complex reactions is critical for biological processes yet our inability to design for specific outcomes limits the development of synthetic analogues. Here, we leverage differentiable simulators to design nontrivial reaction pathways in colloidal assemblies. By optimizing over external structures, we achieve controlled disassembly and particle release from colloidal shells. Lastly, we characterize the role of configurational entropy in the structure via both forward calculations and optimization, inspiring new parameterizations of designed colloidal reactions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Thermodynamics of Collapse of Gels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stimulus-induced volumetric phase transition in gels may be potentially exploited for various bio-engineering and mechanical engineering applications. Since the discovery of the phenomenon in the 1970s, extensive experimental research has helped understand the phase transition and related critical phenomena. Yet, little insight is available on the evolving microstructure. In this article, we aim at unravelling certain geometric aspects of the micromechanics underlying discontinuous phase transition in polyacrylamide gels. Towards this, we use geometric thermodynamics and a Landau-Ginzburg type free energy functional involving a squared gradient, in conjunction with Flory-Huggins theory. We specifically exploit Ruppeiner's approach of Riemannian geometry-enriched thermodynamic fluctuation theory, which was previously employed to investigate phase transitions in van der Waals fluids and black holes. The framework equips us with a scalar curvature that is typically indicative of certain aspects of the microstructure during phase transition. Since previous studies have indicated that curvature divergence relates to correlation length divergence, we infer that the gel possesses a heterogeneous microstructure during phase transition, i.e. at critical points. Curvature also provides an insight into the universality class of phase transition and the nature of polymer-polymer interactions.</description>

      <title>Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Policy-guided Monte Carlo on general state spaces: Application to glass-forming mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy-guided Monte Carlo is an adaptive method to simulate classical interacting systems. It adjusts the proposal distribution of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to maximize the sampling efficiency, using a formalism inspired by reinforcement learning. In this work, we first extend the policy-guided method to deal with a general state space, comprising, for instance, both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom, and then apply it to a few paradigmatic models of glass-forming mixtures. We assess the efficiency of a set of physically inspired moves whose proposal distributions are optimized through on-policy learning. Compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, the optimized proposals are two orders of magnitude faster for an additive soft sphere mixture but yield a much more limited speed-up for the well-studied Kob-Andersen model. We discuss the current limitations of the method and suggest possible ways to improve it.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy--the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits--within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using state-of-the-art numerics based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling work extraction at a generic time (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between local ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>
