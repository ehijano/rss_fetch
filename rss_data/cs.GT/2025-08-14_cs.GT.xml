      <title>Carbon Pricing in Traffic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we study how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that respect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general multi-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These externalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the traversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes.
  We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as Wardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More precisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible flow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting appropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there are prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of existence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are non-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a convex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a suitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the total externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For increasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a single externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all equilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are networks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that the minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time. This allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit schemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under mild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in traffic networks.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of strategic classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are nowadays applied in high-stakes decisions in finance, healthcare, criminal justice, or education. Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered about classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained. Which collective dynamics will result from users' adaptation and algorithms' retraining? We apply evolutionary game theory to address this question. Our framework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of feedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a case study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending. We consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction paradigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we are able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic classification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the institutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm (e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role of improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that increased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users' improvement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in practice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users' improvement rates. The speed at which the institutions re-adapt to the user's population plays a role in the final outcome. Finally, we explore a scenario where strict institutions provide actionable recourse to their unsuccessful users and observe cycling dynamics so far unnoticed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, a buyer wishes to procure a set of items of maximum value from self-interested players. We have a valuation function $v:2^U \to \mathbb{R}_+$, where $U$ is the set of all items, where $v(S)$ specifies the value obtained from set $S$ of items. The entirety of current work on budget-feasible mechanisms has focused on the single-dimensional setting, wherein each player holds a single item $e$ and incurs a private cost $c_e$ for supplying item $e$.
  We introduce multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design: the universe $U$ is now partitioned into item-sets $\{G_i\}$ held by the different players, and each player $i$ incurs a private cost $c_i(S_i)$ for supplying the set $S_i\subseteq G_i$ of items. A budget-feasible mechanism is a mechanism that is truthful, and where the total payment made to the players is at most some given budget $B$. The goal is to devise a budget-feasible mechanism that procures a set of items of large value. We obtain the first approximation guarantees for multidimensional budget feasible mechanism design.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, we prove an impossibility result showing that the standard benchmark used in single-dimensional budget-feasible mechanism design, namely the algorithmic optimum is inadequate in that no budget-feasible mechanism can achieve good approximation relative to this. We identify that the chief underlying issue here is that there could be a monopolist which prevents a budget-feasible mechanism from obtaining good guarantees. Second, we devise an alternate benchmark, $OPT_{Bench}$, that allows for meaningful approximation guarantees, thereby yielding a metric for comparing mechanisms. Third, we devise budget-feasible mechanisms that achieve constant-factor approximation guarantees with respect to this benchmark for XOS valuations.</description>

      <title>Project Submission Games in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the framework of project submission games, capturing the behavior of project proposers in participatory budgeting (and multiwinner elections). Here, each proposer submits a subset of project proposals, aiming at maximizing the total cost of those that get funded. We focus on finding conditions under which pure Nash equilibria (NE) exist in our games, and on the complexity of checking whether they exist. We also seek algorithms for computing best responses for the proposers</description>

      <title>The Price of EF1 for Few Agents with Additive Ternary Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a resource allocation problem with agents that have additive ternary valuations for a set of indivisible items, and bound the price of envy-free up to one item (EF1) allocations. For a large number $n$ of agents, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, implying that the price of EF1 is no better than when the agents have general subadditive valuations. We then focus on instances with few agents and show that the price of EF1 is $12/11$ for $n=2$, and between $1.2$ and $1.256$ for $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Swap Bounded Envy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fairness in the allocation of discrete goods. Exactly fair (envy-free) allocations are impossible, so we discuss notions of approximate fairness. In particular, we focus on allocations in which the swap of two items serves to eliminate any envy, either for the allocated bundles or with respect to a reference bundle. We propose an algorithm that, under some restrictions on agents' preferences, achieves an allocation with ``swap bounded envy.''</description>

      <title>A Note on Approximating Weighted Nash Social Welfare with Additive Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the first $O(1)$-approximation for the weighted Nash Social Welfare problem with additive valuations. The approximation ratio we obtain is $e^{1/e} + \epsilon \approx 1.445 + \epsilon$, which matches the best known approximation ratio for the unweighted case.
  Both our algorithm and analysis are simple. We solve a natural configuration LP for the problem, and obtain the allocation of items to agents using a randomized version of the Shmoys-Tardos rounding algorithm developed for unrelated machine scheduling problems. In the analysis, we show that the approximation ratio of the algorithm is at most the worst gap between the Nash social welfare of the optimum allocation and that of an EF1 allocation, for an unweighted Nash Social Welfare instance with identical additive valuations. This was shown to be at most $e^{1/e} \approx 1.445$ by Barman, Krishnamurthy and Vaish, leading to our approximation ratio.</description>

      <title>How Irrationality Shapes Nash Equilibria: A Prospect-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncooperative games with uncertain payoffs have been classically studied under the expected-utility theory framework, which relies on the strong assumption that agents behave rationally. However, simple experiments on human decision makers found them to be not fully rational, due to their subjective risk perception. Prospect theory was proposed as an empirically-grounded model to incorporate irrational behaviours into game-theoretic models. But, how prospect theory shapes the set of Nash equilibria when considering irrational agents, is still poorly understood. To this end, we study how prospect theoretic transformations may generate new equilibria while eliminating existing ones. Focusing on aggregative games, we show that capturing users' irrationality can preserve symmetric equilibria while causing the vanishing of asymmetric equilibria. Further, there exist value functions which map uncountable sets of equilibria in the expected-utility maximization framework to finite sets. This last result may shape some equilibrium selection theories for human-in-the-loop systems where computing a single equilibrium is insufficient and comparison of equilibria is needed.</description>

      <title>A Sequence-Form Characterization and Differentiable Path-Following Computation of Normal-Form Perfect Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequence form, owing to its compact and holistic strategy representation, has demonstrated significant efficiency in computing normal-form perfect equilibria for two-player extensive-form games with perfect recall. Nevertheless, the examination of $n$-player games remains underexplored. To tackle this challenge, we present a sequence-form characterization of normal-form perfect equilibria for $n$-player extensive-form games, achieved through a class of perturbed games formulated in sequence form. Based on this characterization, we develop a differentiable path-following method for computing normal-form perfect equilibria and prove its convergence. This method formulates an artificial logarithmic-barrier game in sequence form, introducing an additional variable to regulate the impact of logarithmic-barrier terms on the payoff functions, as well as the transition of the strategy space. We prove the existence of a smooth equilibrium path defined by the artificial game, starting from an arbitrary positive realization plan and converging to a normal-form perfect equilibrium of the original game as the additional variable approaches zero. Furthermore, we extend Harsanyi's linear and logarithmic tracing procedures to the sequence form and develop two alternative methods for computing normal-form perfect equilibria. Numerical experiments further substantiate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Defer in Congested Systems: The AI-Human Interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-stakes applications rely on combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) and humans for responsive and reliable decision making. For example, content moderation in social media platforms often employs an AI-human pipeline to promptly remove policy violations without jeopardizing legitimate content. A typical heuristic estimates the risk of incoming content and uses fixed thresholds to decide whether to auto-delete the content (classification) and whether to send it for human review (admission). This approach can be inefficient as it disregards the uncertainty in AI's estimation, the time-varying element of content arrivals and human review capacity, and the selective sampling in the online dataset (humans only review content filtered by the AI).
  In this paper, we introduce a model to capture such an AI-human interplay. In this model, the AI observes contextual information for incoming jobs, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules admitted jobs for human review. During these reviews, humans observe a job's true cost and may overturn an erroneous AI classification decision. These reviews also serve as new data to train the AI but are delayed due to congestion in the human review system. The objective is to minimize the costs of eventually misclassified jobs.
  We propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed jobs, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for online learning in contextual queueing systems. Moreover, numerical experiments based on online comment datasets show that our algorithm can substantially reduce the number of misclassifications compared to existing content moderation practice.</description>
