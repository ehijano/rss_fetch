      <title>Non-Uniform Lattices of Large Systole Containing a Fixed 3-Manifold Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d$ be a square free positive integer and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ a totally real quadratic field over $\mathbb{Q}$. We show there exists an arithmetic lattice L in $SL(8,\mathbb{R})$ with entries in the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ and a sequence of lattices $\Gamma_n $ commensurable to L such that the systole of the locally symmetric finite volume manifold $\Gamma_n \diagdown SL(8,\mathbb{R}) \diagup SO(8)$ goes to infinity as $n \rightarrow \infty$, yet every $\Gamma_n$ contains the same hyperbolic 3-manifold group $\Pi$, a finite index subgroup of the arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold vol3. Notably, such an example does not exist in rank one, so this is a feature unique to higher rank lattices.</description>

      <title>The Braid Indices of Pretzel Links: A Comprehensive Study, Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the braid index of an oriented link is generally a hard problem. In the case of alternating links, some significant progresses have been made in recent years which made explicit and precise braid index computations possible for links from various families of alternating links, including the family of all alternating Montesinos links. However, much less is known for non-alternating links. For example, even for the non-alternating pretzel links, which are special (and simpler) Montesinos links, the braid index is only known for a very limited few special cases. In this paper and its sequel, we study the braid indices for all non-alternating pretzel links by a systematic approach. We classify the pretzel links into three different types according to the Seifert circle decompositions of their standard link diagrams. More specifically, if $D$ is a standard diagram of an oriented pretzel link $\mathcal{L}$, $S(D)$ is the Seifert circle decomposition of $D$, and $C_1$, $C_2$ are the Seifert circles in $S(D)$ containing the top and bottom long strands of $D$ respectively, then $\mathcal{L}$ is classified as a Type 1 (Type 2) pretzel link if $C_1\not=C_2$ and $C_1$, $C_2$ have different (identical) orientations. In the case that $C_1=C_2$, then $\mathcal{L}$ is classified as a Type 3 pretzel link. In this paper, we present the results of our study on Type 1 and Type 2 pretzel links. Our results allow us to determine the precise braid index for any non-alternating Type 1 or Type 2 pretzel link. Since the braid indices are already known for all alternating pretzel links from our previous work, it means that we have now completely determined the braid indices for all Type 1 and Type 2 pretzel links.</description>

      <title>Some Observations on projective Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the upper characteristic rank of the projective Stiefel manifolds over $\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ and $\mathbb H$ and of the flip Stiefel manifolds. We provide bounds for the cup lengths of these spaces. We also provide necessary conditions for existence of $S^3$-map between quarternionic Stiefel manifolds using Fadell-Husseini index.</description>

      <title>Eisenstein integers and equilateral ideal triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the relationship between Penner's $\lambda$-length and the norms of Eisenstein integers. This leads to a geometric proof of the fact, attributed to Fermat, that every prime $p$ of the form $3k + 1$ is the norm of an Eisenstein integer that is can be written as $a^2 - ab + b^2$ for some $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Knot lattice homology and $q$-series invariants for plumbed knot complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an invariant of negative definite plumbed knot complements unifying knot lattice homology, due to Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz, and Szab\'o, and the BPS $q$-series of Gukov and Manolescu. This invariant is a natural extension of weighted graded roots of negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds introduced earlier by the first two authors and Krushkal. We prove a surgery formula relating our invariant with the weighted graded root of the surgered 3-manifold.</description>

      <title>On four-manifolds without 1- and 3-handles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We note that infinitely many irreducible, closed, simply connected 4-manifolds, with prescribed signature and spin type, admit perfect Morse functions, i.e. they can be given handle decompositions without 1- and 3-handles. In particular, there are many such 4-manifolds homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard 4-manifolds # m (S^2 x S^2) and # n (CP^2 # -CP^2), respectively, which answers Problem 4.91 on Kirby's 1997 list.</description>

      <title>On equivariant embeddings of hyperbolic surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of when a closed hyperbolic surface admits a totally geodesic embedding into a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, and in particular equivariant versions of such embeddings. In a previous paper we considered orientation-preserving actions on orientable surfaces; in the present paper, we consider large orientation-reversing actions on orientable surfaces, and also large actions on nonorientable surfaces.</description>

      <title>Wrapping Cycles in Delaunay Complexes: Bridging Persistent Homology and Discrete Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between discrete Morse theory and persistent homology in the context of shape reconstruction methods. Specifically, we consider the construction of Wrap complexes, introduced by Edelsbrunner as a subcomplex of the Delaunay complex, and the construction of lexicographic optimal homologous cycles, also considered by Cohen-Steiner, Lieutier, and Vuillamy in a similar setting. We show that for any cycle in a Delaunay complex for a given radius parameter, the lexicographically optimal homologous cycle is supported on the Wrap complex for the same parameter, thereby establishing a close connection between the two methods. We obtain this result by establishing a fundamental connection between reduction of cycles in the computation of persistent homology and gradient flows in the algebraic generalization of discrete Morse theory.</description>

      <title>Divisible cube complexes and finite-order automorphisms of RAAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric characterisation of those groups that arise as fixed subgroups of finite-order untwisted automorphisms of right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs). They are precisely the fundamental groups of a class of compact special cube complexes that we term "divisible".
  The main corollary is that surface groups arise as fixed subgroups of finite-order automorphisms of RAAGs, as do all commutator subgroups of right-angled Coxeter groups. These appear to be the first examples of such fixed subgroups that are not themselves isomorphic to RAAGs.
  Using a variation of canonical completions, we also observe that every special group arises as the fixed subgroup of an automorphism of a finite-index subgroup of a RAAG.</description>

      <title>Robust quasi-isometric embeddings inapproximable by Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. For all but finitely many $m\in \mathbb{N}$, we exhibit the first examples of non-locally rigid, Zariski dense, robust quasi-isometric embeddings of hyperbolic groups in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{K})$ which are not limits of Anosov representations. As a consequence, we show that an analogue of Sullivan's structural stabilty theorem for Kleinian groups fails for Anosov representations in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{C}), m\geq 30$.</description>

      <title>The algebraic structure of hyperbolic graph braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genevois recently classified which graph braid groups on $\ge 3$ strands are word hyperbolic. In the $3$-strand case, he asked whether all such word hyperbolic groups are actually free; this reduced to checking two infinite classes of graphs: sun and pulsar graphs. We prove that $3$-strand braid groups of sun graphs are free. On the other hand, it was known to experts that $3$-strand braid groups of most pulsar graphs contain surface subgroups. We provide a simple proof of this and prove an additional structure theorem for these groups.</description>
