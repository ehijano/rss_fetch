      <title>On the $m$-graph of a finite Abelian Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a finite abelian (commutative) group of order $n \geq 2$, and $m &gt;1$ be an integer. We define the $m$-graph of $H$, denoted by $m-G(H)$, as a simple undirected graph with vertex set $H$, and two distinct vertices, $a, b \in H$, are connected by an edge if and only if $a^m = b$ or $b^m = a$. Several results regarding the properties of the $m$-$G(H)$ have been established.</description>

      <title>Yet another doubly refined enumeration of Alternating Sign Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the alternating sign matrix conjecture, proposed by Mills, Robbins, and Rumsey in 1982, was proved by Zeilberger and Kuperberg, several refined enumerations have been considered. In particular, Behrend et al. obtained a quadruply refined enumeration by adding certain parameters. In this paper, we revisit the doubly refined enumeration of alternating sign matrices by adding three parameters: the number of $-1$'s, the position of the $1$ in the first row, and the position of the $1$ in the last row. Using Lascoux's formula on symmetry functions, we derive a new determinantal formula for this doubly refined enumeration.
  Besides the enumeration conjecture, Mills et al. also proposed a decomposition conjecture, which was subsequently proven by Kuperberg. We present a refinement of that decomposition conjecture.</description>

      <title>The height of skew Dyck paths with two variants of downsteps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, in the context of walks of hexagonal circle packings, interest has emerged in the family of skew Dyck paths with two variants
  of down-steps. These paths have steps $U, D_g, D_b, L=D_r$. Using generating functions, the kernel method and (in)finite linear systems, contributions to the (average) height and other enumerations are made. As in many similar instances, the average height is of order $\sqrt n$.</description>

      <title>Cubic factor-invariant graphs of bialternating cycle quotient type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, investigation of the so-called factor-invariant cubic graphs was initiated by Alspach, Khodadadpour and Kreher. For a cubic graph $\Gamma$ and a vertex-transitive subgroup $G$ of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$, a $2$-factor $\mathcal{C}$ of $\Gamma$ is said to be {\em $G$-invariant} if the set $\mathcal{C}$ is preserved by each element of $G$. Investigations of factor-invariant cubic graphs therefore contribute to the rapidly growing theory on cubic vertex-transitive graphs, providing a better insight into the structure of such graphs.
  Initially, the examples where $\mathcal{C}$ consists of a single or just two cycles were analyzed. In a recent paper by Brian Alspach and the author of this paper, the investigation of the examples for which the corresponding quotient graph $\Gamma_\mathcal{C}$ of $\Gamma$ with respect to $\mathcal{C}$ is a cycle was initiated. Moreover, the graphs of the so-called {\em alternating cycle quotient type} were classified.
  In this paper, the remaining examples, that is the graphs of the {\em bialternating cycle quotient type}, are classified. It is shown that they belong to a previously unknown infinite $5$-parametric family of graphs of girth at most $10$ and that they are Cayley graphs of groups with respect to three involutions.</description>

      <title>Bond Polytope under Vertex- and Edge-sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cut in a graph $G$ is called a {\em bond} if both parts of the cut induce connected subgraphs in $G$, and the {\em bond polytope} is the convex hull of all bonds. Computing the maximum weight bond is an NP-hard problem even for planar graphs. However, the problem is solvable in linear time on $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, and in more general, on graphs of bounded treewidth, essentially due to clique-sum decomposition into simpler graphs.
  We show how to obtain the bond polytope of graphs that are $1$- or $2$-sum of graphs $G_1$ and $ G_2$ from the bond polytopes of $G_1,G_2$. Using this we show that the extension complexity of the bond polytope of $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs is linear. Prior to this work, a linear size description of the bond polytope was known only for $3$-connected planar $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, essentially only for wheel graphs.
  We also describe an elementary linear time algorithm for the \MaxBond problem on $(K_5\setminus e)$-minor-free graphs. Prior to this work, a linear time algorithm in this setting was known. However, the hidden constant in the big-Oh notation was large because the algorithm relies on the heavy machinery of linear time algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth, used as a black box.</description>

      <title>Polynomization of Sun's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p(n)$ denote the number of partitions of a natural number $n$. As $ n \to \infty$, the $n$th root of $p(n)$ tends to $1$, which is related to the Cauchy--Hadamard test for power series. Andrews also discovered an elementary proof. Sun conjectured that this happens in a certain way for $n\geq 6$: \begin{equation*} \sqrt[n]{p(n)} &gt; \sqrt[n+1]{p(n+1)}. \end{equation*} The conjecture was proved by Wang and Zhu; shortly thereafter, Chen and Zheng independently obtained a second proof. In this paper, we follow an approach by Rota. We consider $p(n)$ as special values of the D'Arcais polynomials, known as the Nekrasov--Okounkov polynomials. This identifies Sun's conjecture as a property of the largest real zero of certain polynomials. This leads to results towards $k$-coloured partitions, overpartitions, and plane partitions. Moreover, we also consider Chebyshev and Laguerre polynomials. The main purpose of this paper is to offer a uniform approach.</description>

      <title>Highly regular vertex-transitive graphs are globally rigid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be globally rigid in $d$-dimensional space if almost all of its embeddings are unique up to isometries. If a graph has enough automorphisms to send any of its vertices into any other, then it is called vertex-transitive. We show that, in any dimension, highly regular vertex-transitive graphs are globally rigid, positively answering a conjecture of Sean Dewar. Furthermore, we construct examples that show that our constant for regularity is best possible.</description>

      <title>The rank-nullity ring of a matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the rank-nullity ring of a matroid $M$, which is a subring of the Chow ring of the permutahedral toric variety. This subring contains the tautological Chern classes of $M$, a fact we deduce from a highly symmetric formula for these classes. When the matroid $M$ is a uniform matroid, the rank-nullity ring coincides with the subring of $S_n$-invariants of the Chow ring of the permutahedral toric variety. In this case, we compute its Hilbert function explicitly and provide a Gr\"obner basis for the ideal of relations among its generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite local ring. We prove a quantitative universality statement for the cokernel of random matrices with i.i.d. entries valued in $R$. Rather than use the moment method, we use the Lindeberg replacement technique. This approach also yields a universality result for several invariants that are finer than the cokernel, such as the span and the determinant.</description>

Abstract: We provide a closed formula for the graded Betti numbers in the linear strands of all powers of binomial edge ideals $J_G$ arising from closed graphs $G$ that do not have the complete graph $K_4$ as an induced subgraph. We show that these agree with the corresponding Betti numbers for the powers of the lexicographic initial ideal of $J_G$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Ene--Rinaldo--Terai in a special case.</description>

Abstract: The cross-ratio degree problem asks for the number of configurations of $n$ points in $\mathbb{P}^1$ that satisfy $n-3$ specified cross-ratio conditions. It is known that the maximal cross-ratio degree for 8 points is at least 4. In this paper, we will see that the maximal cross-ratio degree for 8 points in $\mathbb{P}^1$ is equal to 4.</description>

      <title>A classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ for a prime $p\geq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A map is a cellular decomposition of a closed surface. In the framework of classifying all regular maps by their supporting surface, it is an open problem to find all closed surfaces that support no regular maps. Classification of regular maps on surfaces with Euler characteristic $-p, -p^2, -p^3, -2p,$ and $-3p$ has already been done by several authors in a series of papers, which also show that surfaces with these Euler characteristic support no regular maps if the corresponding prime $p$ satisfies certain conditions. In this paper, assuming that $p\geq 5$ is a prime and $i\geq 4$, we show that the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a regular map with Euler characteristic $-p^i$ is bounded by $p^{i-1}$ unless $p\in \{5, 7, 13\}$, and we show the existence of a normal $p$-subgroup for these regular maps whenever a Sylow $p$-subgroup has order at least $\sqrt{p^i}$, laying a solid foundation for using an inductive method to completely characterize regular maps of Euler characteristic $-p^i$. Based on this, we classify all regular maps with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ for a prime $p\geq 5$ in terms of reduced presentations of their automorphism groups. Consequently, a closed surface with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ supports no regular maps if and only if $p\notin \{2,3,5,7,13\}$.</description>

Abstract: An element of a group is called \emph{reversible} if it is conjugate to its inverse, and \emph{strongly reversible} if it can be expressed as a product of two involutions. We study strongly reversible elements in the Riordan group and in several of its important subgroups. We show that not every reversible element in the Riordan group is strongly reversible, and we investigate products of reversible elements in the Riordan group.</description>

      <title>Frame eversion and contextual geometric rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove rigidity results describing contextually-constrained maps defined on Grassmannians and manifolds of ordered independent line tuples in finite-dimensional vector or Hilbert spaces. One statement in the spirit of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry classifies maps between full Grassmannians of two $n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, $n\ge 3$, preserving dimension and lattice operations for pairs with commuting orthogonal projections, as precisely those induced by semilinear injections unique up to scaling.
  In a different but related direction, denote the manifolds of ordered orthogonal (linearly-independent) $n$-tuples of lines in an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $V$ by $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(V)$ (respectively $\mathbb{F}(V)$) and, for partitions $\pi$ of the set $\{1..n\}$, call two tuples $\pi$-linked if the spans along $\pi$-blocks agree. A Wigner-style rigidity theorem proves that the symmetric maps $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(\mathbb{C}^n)\to \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, $n\ge 3$ respecting $\pi$-linkage are precisely those induced by semilinear injections, hence by linear or conjugate-linear maps if also assumed measurable. On the other hand, in the $\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$-defined analogue the only other possibility is a qualitatively new type of purely-contextual-global symmetry transforming a tuple $(\ell_i)_i$ of lines into $\left(\left(\bigoplus_{j\ne i}\ell_j\right)^{\perp}\right)_i$.</description>

      <title>Pattern Avoidance for Fibonacci Sequences using $k$-Regular Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16052v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two $k$-ary Fibonacci recurrences are $a_k(n) = a_k(n-1) + k \cdot a_k(n-2)$ and $b_k(n) = k \cdot b_k(n-1) + b_k(n-2)$. We provide a simple proof that $a_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that avoid patterns $\{121, 123, 132, 213\}$ when using base cases $a_k(0) = a_k(1) = 1$ for any $k \geq 1$. This was previously proven by Kuba and Panholzer in the context of Wilf-equivalence for restricted Stirling permutations, and it creates Simion and Schmidt's classic result on the Fibonacci sequence when $k=1$, and the Jacobsthal sequence when $k=2$. We complement this theorem by proving that $b_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n]$ that avoid $\{122, 213\}$ with $b_k(0) = b_k(1) = 1$ for any~$k \geq 2$. Finally, we conjecture that $|Av^{2}_{n}(\underline{121}, 123, 132, 213)| = a_1(n)^2$ for $n \geq 0$. That is, vincularizing the Stirling pattern in Kuba and Panholzer's Jacobsthal result gives the Fibonacci-squared numbers.</description>

      <title>$K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs admit quasi-isometry with additive distortion to graphs of tree-width at most two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is an \emph{induced minor} of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of edge contractions and vertex deletions. Otherwise, $G$ is \emph{$H$-induced minor-free}. In this paper, we provide a different proof of the fact that $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs admit a quasi-isometry with additive distortion to graphs with tree-width at most two. Our proof yields a $O(nm)$-time algorithm which takes as input a $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and outputs a tree-width two graph $H$ with the desired additive distortion. For \emph{universally signable} graphs, a subclass of $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs, the time complexity of our algorithm is linear. As a consequence, we obtain a truly sub-quadratic time additive constant factor approximation algorithm to compute the \emph{diameter} of a universally signable graph. In contrast, assuming the \emph{Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis} (\textsc{SETH}), the diameter of split graphs (a very restricted class of universally signable graphs), cannot be computed in truly sub-quadratic time [Borassi et al. (ENTCS, 2016)].</description>

      <title>Tiling symmetric groups by transpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nonempty subsets $X$ and $Y$ of a group $G$, we say that $(X,Y)$ is a tiling of $G$ if every element of $G$ can be uniquely expressed as $xy$ for some $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$. In 1966, Rothaus and Thompson studied whether the symmetric group $S_n$ with $n\geq3$ admits a tiling $(T_n,Y)$, where $T_n$ consists of the identity and all the transpositions in $S_n$. They showed that no such tiling exists if $1+n(n-1)/2$ is divisible by a prime number at least $\sqrt{n}+2$. In this paper, we establish a new necessary condition for the existence of such a tiling: the subset $Y$ must be partition-transitive with respect to certain partitions of $n$. This generalizes the result of Rothaus and Thompson, as well as a result of Nomura in 1985. We also study whether $S_n$ can be tiled by the set $T_n^*$ of all the transpositions, which finally leads us to conjecture that neither $T_n$ nor $T_n^*$ tiles $S_n$ for any $n\geq4$.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity of systolic and Helly complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that finite (weakly) systolic and Helly complexes can be reconstructed from their boundary distances (computed in their 1-skeleta). Furthermore, Helly complexes and 2-dimensional systolic complexes can be reconstructed by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with respect to the number of vertices of the complex. Both results can be viewed as a positive contribution to a general question of Haslegrave, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan (2025). The reconstruction of a finite cell complex from the boundary distances is the discrete analogue of the boundary rigidity problem, which is a classical problem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>A short proof of an upper bound on the growth constant of polyiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a short and elementary proof that the growth constant of polyiamonds is at most $1+2z+3z^2$ for the unique real root $z$ of the equation $2z^3+z^2-1=0$. This coincidentally suffices to recover the best known upper bound $3.6108$. Unlike the previous proof of this bound, which relied on computer-assisted technical arguments and the counts of polyiamonds with up to 75 triangles, our method is based on a straightforward recurrence that can be verified by hand with minimal effort.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes combinatorial characterisations of forced-symmetric and forced-periodic rigidity (under a fixed lattice) of bar-joint frameworks in non-Euclidean normed planes. In $\ell_q$-planes for $q\in(1,\infty)\backslash\{2\}$, we prove characterisations for forced-periodic rigidity and forced-reflectionally-symmetric rigidity. We also characterise forced-symmetric rigidity in this space with respect to the orientation-reversing wallpaper group $\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes\mathcal{C}_s$, otherwise known as $pm$ in crystallography. In the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$-planes, we provide characterisations for forced-periodic rigidity and forced-$\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes\mathcal{C}_s$-symmetric rigidity. All of these characterisations are proved by inductive constructions involving Henneberg-type graph operations.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and Distribution of Permutation Rows and Columns in Equi-$n$-Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce consecutive equi-$n$-squares, a variant of equi-$n$-squares in which at least one row or column forms a fixed permutation of $\{1,\dots,n\}$, taken for concreteness to be $(1,\dots,n)$. More generally, the enumeration and probabilistic arguments presented here extend to the occurrence of any prescribed permutation as a row or column of an equi-$n$-square. We derive exact and asymptotic formulas for the number of consecutive equi-$n$-squares, showing precisely how their proportion among all equi-$n$-squares rapidly approaches zero as $n\to\infty$.
  We also analyze the distribution of consecutive equi-$n$-squares under uniform random sampling and explore connections to algebraic structures, interpreting equi-$n$-squares and consecutive equi-$n$-squares as Cayley tables. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with Monte Carlo simulations for small values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Sidon subsets of perfect difference sets, featuring a human-assisted proof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve a $1000 Erd\H{o}s prize problem, complete with formal verification generated by a large language model.
  In over a dozen papers, beginning in 1976 and spanning two decades, Paul Erd\H{o}s repeatedly posed one of his "favourite" conjectures: every finite Sidon set can be extended to a finite perfect difference set. We establish that {1, 2, 4, 8, 13} is a counterexample to this conjecture.
  During the preparation of this paper, we discovered that although this problem was presumed to be open for half a century, Marshall Hall, Jr. published a different counterexample three decades before Erd\H{o}s first posed the problem. With a healthy skepticism of this apparent oversight, and out of an abundance of caution, we used ChatGPT to vibe code a Lean proof of both Hall's and our counterexamples.</description>

      <title>An exact Ramsey number of large bipartite graphs versus odd wheel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey number for the pair of graphs $\mathbb{K}_{1,n}$ (star) versus $W_{m}$ (wheel) has been extensively studied. In contrast, the Ramsey number of $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ versus the wheel is not yet explored due to the bit more structural complexity of $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ compared to the star. In this article, we have established an exact value of $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ versus $W_{m}$ for large $n$ and $m$. In particular, we have proved \begin{equation*} R(\mathbb{K}_{2,n}, W_{m})=3n+4, \end{equation*} whenever $n$ and $m$ are sufficiently large integers satisfying $n\geq4m$ and $m$ is an odd integer. This proves the $W_{m}$-goodness of $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$. Our proof combines probabilistic methods with an analysis of structural dependencies. As part of the argument, we resolve a structural rigidity question concerning highly dependent neighbourhoods (Lemma 3.12).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study structural and topological properties of nested set complexes of matroids with arbitrary building sets, proving that these complexes are vertex decomposable and admit convex ear decompositions. These results unify and generalize several recent and classical theorems on Bergman complexes and augmented Bergman complexes of matroids. As a first application, we show that the $h$-vector of a nested set complex is strongly flawless and, in particular, top-heavy. We then specialize to the boundary complex of the Deligne--Mumford--Knudsen moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0, n}$ of rational stable marked curves, which coincides with the complex of trees, establishing new structural decomposition theorems and deriving combinatorial formulas for its face enumeration polynomials.</description>

      <title>Relation between broadcast domination and multipacking numbers on chordal and other hyperbolic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a graph $ G = (V, E) $ with a vertex set $ V $ and an edge set $ E $, a function
  $ f : V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, . . . , diam(G)\} $ is called a \emph{broadcast} on $ G $. For each
  vertex $ u \in V $, if there exists a vertex $ v $ in $ G $ (possibly, $ u = v $) such that $ f (v) &gt; 0 $ and
  $ d(u, v) \leq f (v) $, then $ f $ is called a dominating broadcast on $ G $. The cost of the dominating broadcast $f$ is the quantity $ \sum_{v\in V}f(v) $. The minimum cost of a dominating broadcast is the broadcast domination number of $G$, denoted by $ \gamma_{b}(G) $.
  A multipacking is a set $ S \subseteq V $ in a
  graph $ G = (V, E) $ such that for every vertex $ v \in V $ and for every integer $ r \geq 1 $, the
  ball of radius $ r $ around $ v $ contains at most $ r $ vertices of $ S $, that is, there are at most
  $ r $ vertices in $ S $ at a distance at most $ r $ from $ v $ in $ G $. The
  multipacking number of $ G $ is the maximum cardinality of a multipacking of $ G $ and
  is denoted by $ mp(G) $.
  We show that, for any connected chordal graph $G$, $\gamma_{b}(G)\leq \big\lceil{\frac{3}{2} mp(G)\big\rceil}$. We also show that $\gamma_b(G)-mp(G)$ can be arbitrarily large for connected chordal graphs by constructing an infinite family of connected chordal graphs such that the ratio $\gamma_b(G)/mp(G)=10/9$, with $mp(G)$ arbitrarily large. Moreover, we show that $\gamma_{b}(G)\leq \big\lfloor{\frac{3}{2} mp(G)+2\delta\big\rfloor} $ holds for all $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs. In addition, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to construct a multipacking of a $\delta$-hyperbolic graph $G$ of size at least $ \big\lceil{\frac{2mp(G)-4\delta}{3} \big\rceil} $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the fundamentals of a new theory of convex geometry -- which we call "broken line convex geometry". This is a theory of convexity where the ambient space is the rational tropicalization of a cluster variety, as opposed to an ambient vector space. In this theory, line segments are replaced by broken line segments, and we adopt the notion of convexity in [CMN21]. We state and prove broken line convex geometry versions of many standard results from usual convex geometry.</description>

Abstract: We develop several combinatorial notions about laminations, some with clear implications for parameter space. We introduce a simplified class of laminations called finite dynamical laminations (FDL). In order to count FDL, we introduce sibling portraits, of which we provide a comprehensive counting theorem. We provide a characterization of which periodic polygons appear in invariant laminations. We introduce the pullback tree. The base of the pullback tree is a set of laminations, and we show that those laminations are proper and invariant, and all laminations in the base of the pullback tree correspond to a polynomial. We define the generational FDL graph, and it provides combinatorial information about polynomial parameter space.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds with relative norm: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are used abundantly in many areas of mathematics and data science. Many bounds (such as the above two) involve the spectral norm of the noise matrix and are sharp in worst case analysis.
  In order to refine these classical bounds, we introduce a new parameter, which we refer to as the relative norm. This parameter measures the strength of the action of the noise matrix on the relevant eigenvectors of the ground matrix. It has turned out that in a number of situations, we can use the relative norm as a replacement for the spectral norm. This has led to a number of notable improvements under certain sets of assumptions, which are frequently met in practice. For instance, our new results apply very well in the case when the noise matrix is random.
  For the purpose of our study, we introduce a new method of analysis, which combines the classical contour integral argument with new (combinatorial) ideas. This method is robust and of independent interest.
  In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces (Davis-Kahan type results). Perturbation bounds for eigenspaces are essential in statistics and theoretical computer science, and thus deserve a special treatment. Furthermore, this will lay the ground for the more technical treatment of general matrix functionals, which appears in a future paper.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the seminal polynomial partitioning theorems of Guth and Katz to a set of semi-Pfaffian sets. Specifically, given a set $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian function is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\vec{q}$ of length $r$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. Also, under some mild conditions on $\vec{q}$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a Pfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$ defined with respect to $\vec{q}$, such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P')$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. To do so, given a $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we establish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ that $\mathcal{X}$ intersects; that is, we prove that the number of connected components of $(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)) \cap \mathcal{X}$ is at most $\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive Pfaffian versions of Szemer\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds on the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.</description>

      <title>A phase transition in Erd\H{o}s-Barak random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study monotone paths in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs on numbered vertices. Benjamini &amp; Tzalik established a phase transition at $p = \frac{\log n}{n}$ for this model. We refine the critical value to $p = \frac{\log n - \log \log n }{n}$ and identify the critical window of order $\Theta(1/n)$.</description>
