      <title>An eigenring construction for free groups and free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a commutative unital ring. For a $k$-algebra $A$ with a multiplicative submodule $J$, we have a canonical subquotient algebra $\mathrm{E}_{A}(J)$ called the eigenring. In the case where $J$ is a left ideal, an adjunction exists between the category of $A$-modules and that of $\mathrm{E}_{A}(J)$-modules. The derived functors associated with this adjunction recover several well-known homological invariants, including group (co)homology and Hochschild (co)homology.
  The purpose of this paper is to present an extension of these constructions, where $k$-algebras are replaced with monads within a specified bicategory. This approach may be regarded as a categorification of eigenrings, given that monads in the bicategory are equivalent with $k$-linear categories. Furthermore, we generalize the aforementioned adjunction, demonstrating how the associated derived functors provide examples of functor homology.
  For a category $\mathcal{C}$, a module over $\mathcal{C}$ is defined as a functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to the category of $k$-modules and $k$-linear maps. In the case where $\mathcal{C}$ is either the opposite category of free groups or that of free modules over a ring $R$, specific types of modules over $\mathcal{C}$ naturally emerge within the context of algebraic topology. These include polynomial modules, analytic modules, outer modules and primitively generated modules. The majority of this paper is devoted to applying the general framework to the study of these module types. The categorification of eigenrings leads to a unified framework in which these types are characterized by certain internal data of the monad $\mathtt{L}_{\mathcal{C}}$ associated with $\mathcal{C}$. In applications, we obtain calculations of particular functor homologies and uncover new aspects of the above module types.</description>

      <title>A formal characterization of discrete condensed objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, proposes a generalization of topology with better categorical properties. It replaces the concept of a topological space by that of a condensed set, which can be defined as a sheaf on a certain site of compact Hausdorff spaces. Since condensed sets are supposed to be a generalization of topological spaces, one would like to be able to study the notion of discreteness. There are various ways to define what it means for a condensed set to be discrete. In this paper we describe them, and prove that they are equivalent. The results have been fully formalized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>

      <title>On The Axioms Of $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$-Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adhesive and quasiadhesive categories provide a general framework for the study of algebraic graph rewriting systems. In a quasiadhesive category any two regular subobjects have a join which is again a regular subobject. Vice versa, if regular monos are adhesive, then the existence of a regular join for any pair of regular subobjects entails quasiadhesivity. It is also known (quasi)adhesive categories can be embedded in a Grothendieck topos via a functor preserving pullbacks and pushouts along (regular) monomorphisms. In this paper we extend these results to $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-adhesive categories, a concept recently introduced to generalize the notion of (quasi)adhesivity. We introduce the notion of $\mathcal{N}$-adhesive morphism, which allows us to express $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-adhesivity as a condition on the subobjects's posets. Moreover, $\mathcal{N}$-adhesive morphisms allows us to show how an $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$-adhesive category can be embedded into a Grothendieck topos, preserving pullbacks and $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-pushouts.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories. Their lengths yield invariants for these categories. We then focus on composition series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. We construct composition series of different lengths, for some smooth projective rational surfaces and for certain smooth threefolds. On the other hand, we prove that for derived categories of finite dimensional representations of Dynkin and extended Dynkin quivers, for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length. If this property would also hold for the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in $10$ general points, then Krah's phantom subcategory would have infinite length. In particular, it would have infinite chain of thick subcategories.</description>
