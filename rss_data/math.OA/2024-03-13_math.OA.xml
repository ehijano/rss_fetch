      <title>Applications of $\mathrm{C}^*$-classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide some background on the category of classifiable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras, whose objects are infinite-dimensional, simple, separable, unital $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras that have finite nuclear dimension and satisfy the universal coefficient theorem, and describe some applications of the classification of objects in, and morphisms into, this category.</description>

      <title>On conjugacy and perturbation of subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conjugacy orbits of certain types of subalgebras in tracial von Neumann algebras. For any separable II$_1$ factor $N_0$ we construct a highly indecomposable non Gamma II$_1$ factor $N$ such that $N_0 \subset N$ and moreover every von Neumann subalgebra of $N$ with Haagerup's property admits a unique embedding up to unitary conjugation. Such a factor necessarily has to be non separable, but we show that it can be taken of density character $2^{\aleph_0}$. On the other hand we are able to construct for any separable II$_1$ factor $M_0$, a separable II$_1$ factor $M$ containing $M_0$ such that every property (T) subfactor admits a unique embedding into $M$ up to uniformly approximate unitary equivalence; i.e., any pair of embeddings can be conjugated up to a small uniform $2$-norm perturbation.</description>

      <title>Powers and roots of partial isometric covariant representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isometric covariant representations play an important role in the study of Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. In this article, we study partial isometric covariant representations and explore under what conditions powers and roots of partial isometric covariant representations are also partial isometric covariant representations.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz operators with symmetric, alternating and anti-symmetric separately radial symbols on the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetric separately radial (with corresponding group $S_n\rtimes \mathbb{T}^n$) and alternating separately radial (with corresponding group $A_n\rtimes \mathbb{T}^n$) symbols, as well as the associated Toeplitz operators on the weighted Bergman spaces on the unit ball on $\mathbb{C}^n$. Using a purely representation theoretic approach we obtain that the $C^*$-algebras generated by each family of such Toeplitz operators is commutative. Furthermore, we show that the symmetric separately radial Toeplitz operators are more general than radial Toeplitz operators, i.e., every radial Toeplitz operator is a symmetric separately radial.</description>

      <title>Paired $E_0$-Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes we prove two main results:
  1) It is well-known that two strongly continuous $E_0$-semigroups on $B(H)$ can be paired if and only if they have anti-isomorphic Arveson systems. For a new notion of pairing (which coincides only for $B(H)$ with the existing one), we show: For a von Neumann algebra $B$, a strongly continuous $E_0$-semigroup on $B$ and a strongly continuous $E_0$-semigroup on $B'$ can be paired if and only if their product systems are commutants of each other.
  2) On the way to prove the former, en passant we have to fill in a long standing important gap in the theory of intertwiner product systems \`a la Arveson (known, so far, only for $B(H)$ in the separable case): Intertwiner product systems of faithful strongly continuous $E_0$-semigroups on von Neumann algebras have sufficiently many strongly continuous sections.
  Both results are out of reach for Arveson's methods [Arv89,Arv90] (which work only in the case $B(H)$; see Remark 1.6, especially, Footnote (f)) and based on the alternative approach from Skeide [Ske16].</description>

      <title>Quasinormalizers in crossed products of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the dynamics of the action $\alpha$ of a discrete group $G$ on a von Neumann algebra $M$, and structural properties of the associated crossed product inclusion $L(G) \subseteq M \rtimes_\alpha G$, and its intermediate subalgebras. This continues a thread of research originating in classical structural results for ergodic actions of discrete, abelian groups on probability spaces. A key tool in the setting of a noncommutative dynamical system is the set of quasinormalizers for an inclusion of von Neumann algebras. We show that the von Neumann algebra generated by the quasinormalizers captures analytical properties of the inclusion $L(G) \subseteq M \rtimes_\alpha G$ such as the Haagerup Approximation Property, and is essential to capturing "almost periodic" behavior in the underlying dynamical system. Our von Neumann algebraic point of view yields a new description of the Furstenberg-Zimmer distal tower for an ergodic action on a probability space, and we establish new versions of the Furstenberg-Zimmer structure theorems for general, tracial $W^*$-dynamical systems. We present a number of examples contrasting the noncommutative and classical settings which also build on previous work concerning singular inclusions of finite von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Normal coactions extend to the C*-envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a normal coaction of a discrete group on an operator algebra extends to a normal coaction on the C*-envelope. This resolves an open problem considered by Kakariadis, Katsoulis, Laca, and X. Li, and provides an elementary proof of a prominent result of Sehnem. As an application, we resolve a question of Li by identifying the C*-envelope of the operator algebra arising from a groupoid-embeddable category and of cancellative right LCM monoids. This latter class includes many examples of monoids that are not group-embeddable.</description>

      <title>The Space of Traces of the Free Group and Free Products of Matrix Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the space of traces of the free group $F_d$ on $2\leq d \leq \infty $ generators is a Poulsen simplex, i.e., every trace is a pointwise limit of extreme traces. This fails for many virtually free groups. The same result holds for free products of the form $C(X_1)*C(X_2)$ where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are compact metrizable spaces without isolated points. Using a similar strategy, we show that the space of traces of the free product of matrix algebras $M_n(\mathbb{C}) * M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a Poulsen simplex as well, answering a question of Musat and R\ordam for $n \geq 4$. Similar results are shown for certain faces of the simplices above, such as the face of finite-dimensional traces or amenable traces.</description>

      <title>Solving the p-Riccati Equations and Applications to the Factorisation of Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solutions of the equation f^{ (p--1) }+ f^p = h^p in the unknown function f overan algebraic function field of characteristic p are very closely linked to the structure and fac-torisations of linear differential operators with coefficients in function fields of characteristic p.However, while being able to solve this equation over general algebraic function fields is necessaryeven for operators with rational coefficients, no general resolution method has been developed.We present an algorithm for testing the existence of solutions in polynomial time in the ``size''of h and an algorithm based on the computation of Riemann-Roch spaces and the selection ofelements in the divisor class group, for computing solutions of size polynomial in the ``size'' of hin polynomial time in the size of h and linear in the characteristic p, and discuss its applicationsto the factorisation of linear differential operators in positive characteristic p.</description>
