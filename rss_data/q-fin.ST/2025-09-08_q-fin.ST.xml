      <title>Predicting Market Troughs: A Machine Learning Approach with Causal Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides robust, new evidence on the causal drivers of market troughs. We demonstrate that conclusions about these triggers are critically sensitive to model specification, moving beyond restrictive linear models with a flexible DML average partial effect causal machine learning framework. Our robust estimates identify the volatility of options-implied risk appetite and market liquidity as key causal drivers, relationships misrepresented or obscured by simpler models. These findings provide high-frequency empirical support for intermediary asset pricing theories. This causal analysis is enabled by a high-performance nowcasting model that accurately identifies capitulation events in real-time.</description>

      <title>The use of financial and sustainability ratios to map a sector. An approach using compositional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The article aims to visualise in a single graph fish and meat processing company groups in Spain with respect to long-term solvency, energy, waste and water intensity and gender employment gap.
  Design/methodology/approach: The selected financial, environmental and social indicators are ratios, which require specific statistical analysis methods to prevent severe skewness and outliers. We use the compositional data methodology and the principal-component analysis biplot.
  Findings: Fish-processing companies have more homogeneous financial, environmental and social performance than their meat-processing counterparts. Specific company groups in both sectors can be identified as poor performers in some of the indicators. Firms with higher solvency tend to be less efficient in energy and water use. Two clusters of company groups with similar performances are identified.
  Research limitations/implications: As of now, few firms publish reports according to the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. In future research larger samples will be available.
  Social Implications: Firm groups can visually see their areas of improvement in their financial, environmental and social performance compared to their competitors in the sector.
  Originality/value: This is the first time in which visualization tools have combined financial, environmental and social indicators. All individual firms can be visually ordered along all indicators simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Beta: A Causal Take on CAPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return contemporaneously \emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral portfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this interpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \to R_{i,t}$ conflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its constituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator contradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the admissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$, and an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \emph{fork}, $Z \to \{R_m, R_i\}$, not $R_m \to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a causal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the underlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain exposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import index-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\ equity data, we show that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any genuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with modest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be read as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed factor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for what remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we address the question of the Multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis method that has been subject to some controversies since its inception almost two decades ago. To this end we propose several new options to deal with negative cross-covariance among two time series, that may serve to construct a more robust view of the multifractal spectrum among the series. We compare these novel options with the proposals already existing in the literature, and we provide fast code in C, R and Python for both new and the already existing proposals. We test different algorithms on synthetic series with an exact analytical solution, as well as on daily price series of ethanol and sugar in Brazil from 2010 to 2023.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of estimating the Hurst parameter of rough stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Han \&amp; Schied, 2023, \textit{arXiv 2307.02582}], an easily computable scale-invariant estimator $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ was constructed to estimate the Hurst parameter of the drifted fractional Brownian motion $X$ from its antiderivative. This paper extends this convergence result by proving that $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ also consistently estimates the Hurst parameter when applied to the antiderivative of $g \circ X$ for a general nonlinear function $g$. We also establish an almost sure rate of convergence in this general setting. Our result applies, in particular, to the estimation of the Hurst parameter of a wide class of rough stochastic volatility models from discrete observations of the integrated variance, including the rough fractional stochastic volatility model.</description>
