      <title>Exploring Large-Volume GAGG Scintillators for use in MeV Gamma-Ray Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray astrophysics in the MeV band is an exciting field in astronomy due to its potential for multi-messenger astrophysics. It has, however, remained under-explored when compared to other wavelengths. One reason for this observational gap is the difficulties with measuring these high-energy photons and the requirement of large amounts of detection material. In this work, we investigate the usage of large-volume GAGG scintillators for use as a calorimeter in future MeV telescopes. We developed a $5\times5$ array calorimeter utilizing $1\times1\times6 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ GAGG crystals with C-series SiPM readout. The calorimeter was tested at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Facility (HIGS) with monoenergetic beams ranging from $2-25 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. Finally, we also investigated larger $1\times1\times8 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ crystals and characterized their response across their depth when their surface treatment is either polished or frosted.</description>

      <title>Results from the CsI Calorimeter onboard the 2023 ComPair Balloon Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ComPair gamma-ray telescope is a technology demonstrator for a future gamma-ray telescope called the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO). The instrument is composed of four subsystems, a double-sided silicon strip detector, a virtual Frisch grid CdZnTe calorimeter, a CsI:Tl based calorimeter, and an anti-coincidence detector (ACD). The CsI calorimeter's goal is to measure the position and energy deposited from high-energy events. To demonstrate the technological readiness, the calorimeter has flown onboard a NASA scientific balloon as part of the GRAPE-ComPair mission and accumulated around 3 hours of float time at an altitude of 40 km. During the flight, the CsI calorimeter observed background radiation, Regener-Pfotzer Maximum, and several gamma-ray activation lines originating from aluminum.</description>

      <title>Simons Observatory: Pre-deployment Performance of a Large Aperture Telescope Optics Tube in the 90 and 150 GHz Spectral Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory will map the temperature and polarization over half of the sky, at millimeter wavelengths in six spectral bands from the Atacama Desert in Chile. These data will provide new insights into the genesis, content, and history of our Universe; the astrophysics of galaxies and galaxy clusters; objects in our solar system; and time-varying astrophysical phenomena. This ambitious new instrument suite, initially comprising three 0.5 m small-aperture telescopes and one 6 m large aperture telescope, is designed using a common combination of new technologies and new implementations to realize an observatory significantly more capable than the previous generation. In this paper, we present the pre-deployment performance of the first mid-frequency "optics tube" which will be fielded on the large aperture telescope with sensitivity to the 90 and 150 GHz spectral bands. This optics tube contains lenses, filters, detectors, and readout components, all of which operate at cryogenic temperatures. It is one of seven that form the core of the large aperture telescope receiver in its initial deployment. We describe this optics tube, including details of comprehensive testing methods, new techniques for beam and passband characterization, and its measured performance. The performance metrics include beams, optical efficiency, passbands, and forecasts for the on-sky performance of the system. We forecast a sensitivity that exceeds the requirements of the large aperture telescope with greater than 30% margin in each spectral band, and predict that the instrument will realize diffraction-limited performance and the expected detector passbands.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long term observations and space missions have generated a wealth of data on the magnetic fields of the Earth and other solar system planets. planetMagfields is a Python package designed to have all the planetary magnetic field data currently available in one place and to provide an easy interface to access the data. planetMagfields focuses on planetary bodies that generate their own magnetic field, namely Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Ganymede. planetMagfields provides functions to compute as well as plot the magnetic field on the planetary surface or at a distance above or under the surface. It also provides functions to filter out the field to large or small scales as well as to produce .vts files to visualize the field in 3D using Paraview, VisIt or similar rendering software. Lastly, the planetMagfields repository also provides a Jupyter notebook for easy interactive visualizations.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Positioning for Deep Sea Neutrino Telescopes with a System of Piezo Sensors Integrated into Glass Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Position calibration in the deep sea is typically done by means of acoustic multilateration using three or more acoustic emitters installed at known positions. Rather than using hydrophones as receivers that are exposed to the ambient pressure, the sound signals can be coupled to piezo ceramics glued to the inside of existing containers for electronics or measuring instruments of a deep sea infrastructure. The ANTARES neutrino telescope operated from 2006 until 2022 in the Mediterranean Sea at a depth exceeding 2000m. It comprised nearly 900 glass spheres with 432mm diameter and 15mm thickness, equipped with photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light from tracks of charged elementary particles. In an experimental setup within ANTARES, piezo sensors have been glued to the inside of such - otherwise empty - glass spheres. These sensors recorded signals from acoustic emitters with frequencies from 46545 to 60235Hz. Two waves propagating through the glass sphere are found as a result of the excitation by the waves in the water. These can be qualitatively associated with symmetric and asymmetric Lamb-like waves of zeroth order: a fast (early) one with $v_e \approx 5$mm/$\mu$s and a slow (late) one with $v_\ell \approx 2$mm/$\mu$s. Taking these findings into account improves the accuracy of the position calibration. The results can be transferred to the KM3NeT neutrino telescope, currently under construction at multiple sites in the Mediterranean Sea, for which the concept of piezo sensors glued to the inside of glass spheres has been adapted for monitoring the positions of the photomultiplier tubes.</description>

      <title>A Fast Radio Burst monitor with a Compact All-Sky Phased Array (CASPA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short-duration radio transients that occur at random times in host galaxies distributed all over the sky. Large field of view instruments can play a critical role in the blind search for rare FRBs. We present a concept for an all-sky FRB monitor using a compact all-sky phased array (CASPA), which can efficiently achieve an extremely large field of view of $\sim10^4$ square degrees. Such a system would allow us to conduct a continuous, blind FRB search covering the entire southern sky. Using the measured FRB luminosity function, we investigate the detection rate for this all-sky phased array and compare the result to a number of other proposed large field-of-view instruments. We predict a rate of a few FRB detections per week and determine the dispersion measure and redshift distributions of these detectable FRBs. This instrument is optimal for detecting FRBs in the nearby Universe and for extending the high-end of the FRB luminosity function through finding ultraluminous events. Additionally, this instrument can be used to shadow the new gravitational-wave observing runs, detect high energy events triggered from Galactic magnetars and search for other bright, but currently unknown transient signals.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Design of Detector Assembly for DIXE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse X-ray Explorer (DIXE) is a proposed X-ray spectroscopic survey experiment for the China Space Station. Its detector assembly (DA) contains the transition edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeter and readout electronics based on the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) on the cold stage. The cold stage is thermally connected to the ADR stage, and a Kevlar suspension is used to stabilize and isolate it from the 4 K environment. TES and SQUID are both sensitive to the magnetic field, so a hybrid shielding structure consisting of an outer Cryoperm shield and an inner niobium shield is used to attenuate the magnetic field. In addition, IR/optical/UV photons can produce shot noise and thus degrade the energy resolution of the TES microcalorimeter. A blocking filter assembly is designed to minimize the effects. In it, five filters are mounted at different temperature stages, reducing the probability of IR/optical/UV photons reaching the detector through multiple reflections between filters and absorption. This paper will describe the preliminary design of the detector assembly and its optimization.</description>

      <title>Radial velocities: direct application of Pierre Connes' shift finding algorithm to Cross-Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pipelines of state-of-the-art spectrographs dedicated to planet detection provide, for each exposure, series of Cross-Correlation Functions (CCFs) built with a Binary Mask (BM), and the absolute radial velocity (RV) derived from Gaussian fit of a weighted average CCF$_{tot}$ of the CCFs. Here we tested the benefits of the application of the shift finding algorithm developed by Pierre Connes directly to the total CCF$_{tot}$, comparing the resulting RV shifts (DRVs) with the results of the Gaussian fits. In a second step, we investigated how the individual DRV profiles along the velocity grid can be used as an easy tool for detection of stellar line shape variations. We tested this new algorithm on 1151 archived spectra of the K2.5 V star HD 40307 obtained with ESO/ESPRESSO during a one-week campaign in 2018. Tests were performed based on the comparison of DRVs with RVs from Gaussian fits. DRV profiles along the velocity grid (DRV(i)) were scrutinized and compared with direct CCF$_{tot}$ ratios. The dispersion of residuals from a linear fit to RVs from 406 spectra recorded within one night, was found to be $\sigma$=1.03 and 0.83 ms$^{-1}$ for the Gaussian fit and the new algorithm respectively, a significant 20\% improvement in accuracy. The two full one-week series obtained during the campaign were also fitted with a 3-planet system Keplerian model. The residual divergence between data and best-fit model is significantly smaller for the new algorithm than for the Gaussian fit. This new algorithm is an easy tool allowing to obtain additional diagnostics on the RV measurements in series of exposures. It increases the accuracy of velocity variation determinations. Also, departures from constancy of the DRVi profiles, as well as varying differences between RVs from this new method and RVs from a Gaussian fit provide diagnostics of line shape variations due to stellar activity.</description>

      <title>Ground-based Image Deconvolution with Swin Transformer UNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As ground-based all-sky astronomical surveys will gather millions of images in the coming years, a critical requirement emerges for the development of fast deconvolution algorithms capable of efficiently improving the spatial resolution of these images. By successfully recovering clean and high-resolution images from these surveys, our objective is to help deepen our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution through accurate photometric measurements. We introduce a two-step deconvolution framework using a Swin Transformer architecture. Our study reveals that the deep learning-based solution introduces a bias, constraining the scope of scientific analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel third step relying on the active coefficients in the sparsity wavelet framework. By conducting a performance comparison between our deep learning-based method and Firedec, a classical deconvolution algorithm, we analyze a subset of the EDisCS cluster samples. We demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of resolution recovery, generalization to different noise properties, and computational efficiency. Not only does the analysis of this cluster sample assess the efficiency of our method, but it also enables us to quantify the number of clumps within these galaxies in relation to their disc colour. This robust technique holds promise for identifying structures in the distant universe from ground-based images.</description>

      <title>Sub-percent Characterization and Polarimetric Performance Analysis of Commercial Micro-polarizer Array Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization imaging can yield crucial information in multiple applications of remote sensing, such as characterization of clouds, aerosols, and the Aurora Borealis. Some applications require sub-percent polarimetric sensitivity and accuracy in determining the Stokes parameters, which can be a challenge to attain. In 2018, Sony released a low-cost CMOS-based imaging chip with integrated micro-polarizer array for general polarization measurements. We implement the calibration steps required for these Sony chips to reach sub-percent polarimetric accuracies. To analyze their performances, we have compared the characteristics of four different detector packages by three manufacturers housing either the monochromatic version or the RGB color variant. We present a comprehensive overview of the effects that these characteristics have on the polarimetric performance of the camera. They include dark noise, behavior over different gain settings, detector/pixel artifacts, and polarimetric effects determined by polarizer extinction ratios, polarizer orientations, and accuracy of polarimetric zero points due to differential pixel gains. In addition to calibrations using unpolarized light and fully linearly polarized light, we assess the polarimetric sensitivity within a tilting and rotating glass-plate set-up. We discuss the benefits of adding a rotating half-wave plate as an additional temporal modulator to generically mitigate some of the detector effects, and achieve better polarimetric sensitivity/accuracy albeit at the expense of lower temporal resolution. We conclude by presenting and discussing the polarimetric limits to which we were able to calibrate the detector effects for practical purposes. By reaching a compound absolute polarimetric uncertainty of less than a percent, these very compact, low-cost detectors are enabled for a multitude of scientific goals.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy with JWST NIRSpec: Diagnostics and Homogeneous Case Study of WASP-39 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JWST has ushered in a new era of exoplanet transit spectroscopy. Among the JWST instruments, the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) has the most extensive set of configurations for exoplanet time series observations. The NIRSpec Prism and G395H grating represent two extremes in NIRSpec instrument modes, with the Prism spanning a wider spectral range (0.6-5.3 $\mu$m at lower resolution (R$\sim$100) compared to G395H (2.87-5.14 $\mu$m; R$\sim$2700). In this work, we develop a new data reduction framework, JexoPipe, to conduct a homogeneous assessment of the two NIRSpec modes for exoplanet spectroscopy. We use observations of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b obtained as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanets ERS program to assess the spectral quality and stability between the two instrument modes at different epochs. We explore the noise sources, effect of saturation, and offsets in transmission spectra between the different instrument modes and also between the two G395H NRS detectors. We find an inter-detector offset in G395H of $\sim$ 40-50 ppm, consistent with recent studies. We find evidence for correlated noise in the Prism white light curve. We find the G395H spectrum to be of higher precision compared to the Prism at the same resolution. We also compare the JexoPipe spectra with those reported from other pipelines. Our work underscores the need for robust assessment of instrument performance and identification of optimal practices for JWST data reduction and analyses.</description>

Abstract: Context: Traditional one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres introduce systematic modelling errors into spectroscopic analyses of FGK-type stars. Aims: We present an updated version of the STAGGER-grid of 3D model atmospheres, and explore the accuracy of post-processing methods in preparation for spectral synthesis. Methods: New and old models were (re)computed following an updated workflow, including an updated opacity binning technique. Spectroscopic tests were performed in 3D LTE for a grid of 216 fictitious Fe I lines, spanning a wide range in oscillator strength, excitation potential and central wavelength, and eight model atmospheres that cover the stellar atmospheric parameter range (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) of FGK-type stars. Using this grid, the impact of vertical and horizontal resolution, and temporal sampling of model atmospheres on spectroscopic diagnostics was tested. Results: We find that downsampling the horizontal mesh from its original size of 240 x 240 grid cells to 80 x 80 cells, i.e. sampling every third grid cell, introduces minimal errors on the equivalent width and normalized line flux across the line and stellar parameter space. Regarding temporal sampling, we find that sampling ten statistically independent snapshots is sufficient to accurately model the shape of spectral line profiles. For equivalent widths, a subsample consisting of only two snapshots is sufficient, introducing an abundance error of less than 0.015 dex. Conclusions: We have computed 32 new model atmospheres and recomputed 116 old model atmospheres present in the original grid. The public release of the STAGGER-grid contains 243 models, excluding models with [Fe/H] = -4.00, and the processed snapshots can be used to improve the accuracy of spectroscopic analyses.</description>

      <title>A reference meteor magnitude for intercomparable fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rate at which meteors pass through Earth's atmosphere has been measured or estimated many times over; existing flux measurements span at least 12 astronomical magnitudes, or roughly five decades in mass. Unfortunately, the common practice of scaling flux to a universal reference magnitude of +6.5 tends to collapse the magnitude or mass dimension. Furthermore, results from different observation networks can appear discrepant due solely to the use of different assumed population indices, and readers cannot resolve this discrepancy without access to magnitude data. We present an alternate choice of reference magnitude that is representative of the observed meteors and minimizes the dependence of flux on population index. We apply this choice to measurements of recent Orionid meteor shower fluxes to illustrate its usefulness for synthesizing independent flux measurements.</description>

      <title>A complete framework for cosmological emulation and inference with CosmoPower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coherent, re-usable python framework which further builds on the cosmological emulator code CosmoPower. In the current era of high-precision cosmology, we require high-accuracy calculations of cosmological observables with Einstein-Boltzmann codes. For detailed statistical analyses, such codes often incur high costs in terms of computing power, making parameter space exploration costly, especially for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM analyses. Machine learning-enabled emulators of Einstein-Boltzmann codes have emerged as a solution to this problem and have become a common way to perform fast cosmological analyses. To enable generation, sharing and use of emulators for inference, we define standards for robustly describing, packaging and distributing them, and present software for easily performing these tasks in an automated and replicable manner. We provide examples and guidelines for generating your own sufficiently accurate emulators and wrappers for using them in popular cosmological inference codes. We demonstrate our framework by presenting a suite of high-accuracy emulators for the CAMB code's calculations of CMB $C_\ell$, $P(k)$, background evolution, and derived parameter quantities. We show that these emulators are accurate enough for both $\Lambda$CDM analysis and a set of single- and two-parameter extension models (including $N_{\rm eff}$, $\sum m_{\nu}$ and $w_0 w_a$ cosmologies) with stage-IV observatories, recovering the original high-accuracy Einstein-Boltzmann spectra to tolerances well within the cosmic variance uncertainties across the full range of parameters considered. We also use our emulators to recover cosmological parameters in a simulated cosmic-variance limited experiment, finding results well within $0.1 \sigma$ of the input cosmology, while requiring typically $\lesssim1/50$ of the evaluation time than for the full Einstein-Boltzmann computation.</description>

      <title>GRASS II: Simulations of Potential Granulation Noise Mitigation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated version of GRASS (the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator, Palumbo et al. 2022) which now uses an expanded library of 22 solar lines to empirically model time-resolved spectral variations arising from solar granulation. We show that our synthesis model accurately reproduces disk-integrated solar line profiles and bisectors, and we quantify the intrinsic granulation-driven radial-velocity (RV) variability for each of the 22 lines studied. We show that summary statistics of bisector shape (e.g., bisector inverse slope) are strongly correlated with the measured anomalous, variability-driven RV at high pixel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. Further, the strength of the correlations vary both line by line and with the summary statistic used. These correlations disappear for individual lines at the typical spectral resolutions and SNRs achieved by current EPRV spectrographs; so we use simulations from GRASS to demonstrate that they can, in principle, be recovered by selectively binning lines that are similarly affected by granulation. In the best-case scenario (high SNR and large number of binned lines), we find that a $\lesssim$30$\%$ reduction in the granulation-induced root mean square (RMS) RV can be achieved, but that the achievable reduction in variability is most strongly limited by the spectral resolution of the observing instrument. Based on our simulations, we predict that existing ultra-high-resolution spectrographs, namely ESPRESSO and PEPSI, should be able to resolve convective variability in other, bright stars.</description>

      <title>A multi-cubic-kilometre neutrino telescope in the western Pacific Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation neutrino telescopes with significantly improved sensitivity are required to pinpoint the sources of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube and uncover the century-old puzzle of cosmic ray origins. A detector near the equator will provide a unique viewpoint of the neutrino sky, complementing IceCube and other neutrino telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere. Here we present results from an expedition to the north-eastern region of the South China Sea, in the western Pacific Ocean. A favorable neutrino telescope site was found on an abyssal plain at a depth of $\sim$ 3.5km. At depths below 3km, the sea current speed, water absorption and scattering lengths for Cherenkov light, were measured to be $v_{\mathrm{c}}&lt;$10cm/s, $\lambda_{\mathrm{abs} }\simeq$ 27m and $\lambda_{\mathrm{sca} }\simeq$ 63m, respectively. Accounting for these measurements, we present the design and expected performance of a next-generation neutrino telescope, TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT). With its advanced photon-detection technology and large dimensions, TRIDENT expects to observe the IceCube steady source candidate NGC 1068 with 5$\sigma$ significance within 1 year of operation. This level of sensitivity will open a new arena for diagnosing the origin of cosmic rays and probing fundamental physics over astronomical baselines.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stellar Rotation Periods Using XGBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to develop a computationally inexpensive approach, based on machine learning techniques, to accurately predict thousands of stellar rotation periods. The innovation in our approach is the use of the XGBoost algorithm to predict the rotation periods of Kepler targets by means of regression analysis. Therefore, we focused on building a robust supervised machine learning model to predict surface stellar rotation periods from structured data sets built from the Kepler catalogue of K and M stars. We analysed the set of independent variables extracted from Kepler light curves and investigated the relationships between them and the ground truth. Using the extreme gradient boosting method, we obtained a minimal set of variables that can be used to build machine learning models for predicting stellar rotation periods. Our models are validated by predicting the rotation periods of about 2900 stars. The results are compatible with those obtained by classical techniques and comparable to those obtained by other recent machine learning approaches, with the advantage of using much fewer predictors. Restricting the analysis to stars with rotation periods of less than 45 days, our models are on average 96 % correct. We have developed an innovative approach, based on a machine learning method, to accurately fit the rotation periods of stars. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the best models generated by the proposed methodology are competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches, with the advantage of being computationally cheaper, easy to train, and relying on small sets of predictors.</description>

      <title>Optical turbulence profiling at the Table Mountain Facility with the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration GEO downlink</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first measurement of the atmospheric optical turbulence profile using the transmitted beam from a satellite laser communication terminal. A Ring Image Next Generation Scintillation Sensor (RINGSS) instrument for turbulence profiling, as described in Tokovinin (MNRAS, 502.1, 2021, 747-808), was deployed at the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Table Mountain Facility (TMF) in California. The optical turbulence profile was measured with the downlink optical beam from the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) Geostationary satellite. LCRD conducts links with the Optical Communication Telescope Laboratory ground station and the RINGSS instrument was co-located at TMF to conduct measurements. Turbulence profiles were measured at day and night and atmospheric coherence lengths were compared with other turbulence monitors such as a solar scintillometer and Polaris motion monitor. RINGSS sensitivity to boundary layer turbulence, a feature not provided by many profilers, is also shown to agree with a boundary layer scintillometer at TMF (R=0.85). Diurnal evolution of optical turbulence and measured profiles are presented. The correlation of RINGSS with other turbulence monitors (R=0.75-0.86) demonstrates the concept of free-space optical communications turbulence profiling, which could be adopted as a way to support optical ground stations in a future Geostationary feeder link network. These results also provide further evidence that RINGSS, a relatively new instrument concept, correlates well with other instruments in daytime and nighttime turbulence.</description>

      <title>TESS Free-floating Planet Candidate Is Likely a Stellar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet candidate in the light curve of the star TIC 107150013 observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has recently been announced. A short-duration (~0.5 day), low-amplitude (~0.06 mag) brightening in the TESS light curve was interpreted as a short-timescale gravitational microlensing event. However, the purported event occurred far from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane (l~ 239 deg, b ~ -5 deg), on a relatively nearby (~3.2 kpc) star, making the microlensing interpretation unlikely. Here, we report the archival photometric observations of TIC 107150013 collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2018 through 2020. The archival OGLE light curve reveals periodic variability indicative of starspots on the surface of the star. The presence of starspots indicates magnetic activity of the star, which may also manifest as stellar flares. We interpret the brightening of TIC 107150013 seen in the TESS data as the stellar flare. We present similar flaring stars detected in the archival OGLE data, mimicking short-timescale, low-amplitude microlensing events. Such stars may be a source of non-negligible false positive detections in the planned space-based microlensing surveys.</description>
