      <title>Markovian Promoter Models: A Mechanistic Alternative to Hill Functions in Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks are typically modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with phenomenological Hill functions to represent transcriptional regulation. While computationally efficient, Hill functions lack mechanistic grounding and cannot capture stochastic promoter dynamics. We present a hybrid Markovian-ODE framework that explicitly models discrete promoter states while maintaining computational tractability. Our approach tracks individual transcription factor binding events as a continuous-time Markov chain, coupled with deterministic ODEs for molecular concentrations. We validate this framework on seven gene regulatory systems spanning basic to advanced complexity: the GAL system, repressilator, Goodwin oscillator, toggle switch, incoherent feed-forward loop, p53-Mdm2 oscillator, and NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Comparison with stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) ground truth demonstrates that Markovian promoter models achieve similar accuracy to full stochastic simulations while being 10-100$\times$ faster. Our framework provides a mechanistic foundation for gene regulation modeling and enables investigation of promoter-level stochasticity in complex regulatory networks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Emergence of Selection Prior to Biological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selection is central to biological evolution, yet there has been no general experimental framework for quantifying selection in chemical systems before life. Here we demonstrate that selection in a prebiological chemical system can be directly quantified. Assembly Theory predicts that selection corresponds to a transition from undirected to directed exploration of chemical possibility space, measurable through the amount of Assembly, A, which integrates molecular assembly index with observed copy number. By analysing peptide ensembles produced under diverse polymerisation conditions, we show that undirected reactions explore sequence space almost uniformly, yielding exploration ratios of 0.85-0.95, whereas reactions influenced by evolved proteases generate markedly lower ratios (0.51-0.75) and elevated A, consistent with selective reinforcement of specific assembly pathways. Across multiple environments and amino-acid combinations, the exploration ratio and ensemble assembly A robustly distinguish directed from undirected exploration, establishing a general, experimentally tractable metric for detecting and measuring selection in chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Inference for Single Cell Omics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory inference is used to order single-cell omics data along a path that reflects a continuous transition between cells. This approach is useful for studying processes like cell differentiation, where a stem cell matures into a specialized cell type, or investigating state changes in pathological conditions. In the current article, we provide a general introduction to trajectory inference, explaining the concepts and assumptions underlying the different methods. We then briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different trajectory inference methods. We also describe best practices for using trajectory inference, such as how to validate the results and how to interpret them in the context of biological knowledge. Finally, the article highlights some applications of trajectory inference in single-cell omics research. These applications include studying cell differentiation, development, and disease.</description>
