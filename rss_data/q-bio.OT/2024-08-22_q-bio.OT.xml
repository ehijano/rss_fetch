      <title>Patterns of Transposable Element Distribution Around Chromatin Ligation Points Revealed by Micro-C Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a significant portion of eukaryotic genomes, yet their role in chromatin organization remains poorly understood. This study investigates the distribution patterns of TEs around chromatin ligation points (LPs) identified through Micro-C experiments in human cells. We analyzed the density of various TE families within a 100kb window centered on LPs, focusing on major families such as Alu and LINE-1 (L1) elements. Our findings reveal distinct, non-random distribution patterns that differ between TE families and exhibit consistent strand-specific biases. These patterns were reproducible across two independent datasets and showed marked differences from random genomic distributions. Notably, we observed family-specific variations in TE density near LPs, with some families showing depletion at LPs followed by periodic fluctuations in density. The consistency of these patterns across TE families and their orientation relative to chromosome arms suggest a fundamental relationship between TEs and higher-order chromatin structure. Our results provide new insights into the potential role of TEs in genome organization and challenge the notion of TEs as passive genomic components. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the functional implications of TE distribution in chromatin architecture and gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Effect of IBA concentration and water soaking on rooting hardwood cuttings of black mulberry (Morus nigra L.)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research was conducted at the College of Agricultural Sciences Engineering/University of Sulaimani/ Kurdistan Region-Iraqi to investigate effects of different concentrations of IBA (0, 3000, 4000 and 5000 ppm) and soaking in water for 24 hours on propagation black mulberry (Morus nigra L.) by hardwood cuttings. In this research the parameters of rooting percentage, root number, root length, sprout bud number, shoot length and shoot diameter were measured. Effect of individual factors showed that the highest rooting percentage (15%) was achieved in cuttings soaked in water for 24 hours, as well as improving other traits. Also, the best (23.33%) rooting was found in cuttings dipped in 4000 ppm IBA. Interaction effects of the two factors showed that cuttings treated with 4000 ppm IBA and soaked in water for 24 hours gave the highest (40%) rooting, and the highest other root and shoot traits were achieved in the same interaction as well.</description>

      <title>Comment on Miscalibration of the Honeybee Odometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a point-by-point response to a non-peer-reviewed document titled The Miscalibration of the Honeybee Odometer [arXiv:2405.12998], authored by L. Luebbert and L. Pachter, that was published on arXiv on 8 May 2024 and subsequently publicised via social and mainstream media. The authors never contacted Srinivasan or Tautz personally with their queries, nor did they seek clarification. They do not work in this research area, and they have drawn several unjustified conclusions that reflect a limited understanding of the data they have examined.</description>

      <title>biorecap: an R package for summarizing bioRxiv preprints with a local LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The establishment of bioRxiv facilitated the rapid adoption of preprints in the life sciences, accelerating the dissemination of new research findings. However, the sheer volume of preprints published daily can be overwhelming, making it challenging for researchers to stay updated on the latest developments. Here, I introduce biorecap, an R package that retrieves and summarizes bioRxiv preprints using a large language model (LLM) running locally on nearly any commodity laptop. biorecap leverages the ollamar package to interface with the Ollama server and API endpoints, allowing users to prompt any local LLM available through Ollama. The package follows tidyverse conventions, enabling users to pipe the output of one function as input to another. Additionally, biorecap provides a single wrapper function that generates a timestamped CSV file and HTML report containing short summaries of recent preprints published in user-configurable subject areas. By combining the strengths of LLMs with the flexibility and security of local execution, biorecap represents an advancement in the tools available for managing the information overload in modern scientific research. The biorecap R package is available on GitHub at https://github.com/stephenturner/biorecap under an open-source (MIT) license.</description>
