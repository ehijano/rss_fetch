      <title>Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Black-Box Distributive Expanded Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a finite set of finitary operation symbols. An $\Omega$-expanded group is a group (written additively and called the additive group of the $\Omega$-expanded group) with an $\Omega$-algebra structure. We use the black-box model of computation in $\Omega$-expanded groups. In this model, elements of a finite $\Omega$-expanded group $H$ are represented (not necessarily uniquely) by bit strings of the same length, say, $n$. Given representations of elements of $H$, equality testing and the fundamental operations of $H$ are performed by an oracle.
  Assume that $H$ is distributive, i.e., all its fundamental operations associated with nonnullary operation symbols in $\Omega$ are distributive over addition. Suppose $s=(s_1,\dots,s_m)$ is a generating system of $H$. In this paper, we present probabilistic polynomial-time black-box $\Omega$-expanded group algorithms for the following problems: (i) given $(1^n,s)$, construct a generating system of the additive group of $H$, (ii) given $(1^n,s,(t_1,\dots,t_k))$ with $t_1,\dots,t_k\in H$, find a generating system of the additive group of the ideal in $H$ generated by $\{t_1,\dots,t_k\}$, and (iii) given $(1^n,s)$, decide whether $H\in\mathfrak V$, where $\mathfrak V$ is an arbitrary finitely based variety of distributive $\Omega$-expanded groups with nilpotent additive groups. The error probability of these algorithms is exponentially small in $n$. In particular, this can be applied to groups, rings, $R$-modules, and $R$-algebras, where $R$ is a fixed finitely generated commutative associative ring with $1$. Rings and $R$-algebras may be here with or without $1$, where $1$ is considered as a nullary fundamental operation.</description>

      <title>Strong Low Degree Hardness for the Number Partitioning Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the number partitioning problem (NPP) one aims to partition a given set of $N$ real numbers into two subsets with approximately equal sum. The NPP is a well-studied optimization problem and is famous for possessing a statistical-to-computational gap: when the $N$ numbers to be partitioned are i.i.d. standard gaussian, the optimal discrepancy is $2^{-\Theta(N)}$ with high probability, but the best known polynomial-time algorithms only find solutions with a discrepancy of $2^{-\Theta(\log^2 N)}$. This gap is a common feature in optimization problems over random combinatorial structures, and indicates the need for a study that goes beyond worst-case analysis.
  We provide evidence of a nearly tight algorithmic barrier for the number partitioning problem. Namely we consider the family of low coordinate degree algorithms (with randomized rounding into the Boolean cube), and show that degree $D$ algorithms fail to solve the NPP to accuracy beyond $2^{-\widetilde O(D)}$. According to the low degree heuristic, this suggests that simple brute-force search algorithms are nearly unimprovable, given any allotted runtime between polynomial and exponential in $N$. Our proof combines the isolation of solutions in the landscape with a conditional form of the overlap gap property: given a good solution to an NPP instance, slightly noising the NPP instance typically leaves no good solutions near the original one. In fact our analysis applies whenever the $N$ numbers to be partitioned are independent with uniformly bounded density.</description>

      <title>Flexible constraint satisfiability and a problem in semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.03127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability. We show the \texttt{NP}-completeness of $2$-robust monotone 1-in-3 3SAT in order to give very small examples of finite algebras with \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. In particular we give a $3$-element algebra with this property, and solve a widely stated problem by showing that the $6$-element Brandt monoid has \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. These are the smallest possible sizes for a general algebra and a semigroup to exhibit \texttt{NP}-hardness for the membership problem of finite algebras in finitely generated varieties.</description>

      <title>Work-Efficient Parallel Counting via Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A canonical approach to approximating the partition function of a Gibbs distribution via sampling is simulated annealing. This method has led to efficient reductions from counting to sampling, including:
  $\bullet$ classic non-adaptive (parallel) algorithms with sub-optimal cost (Dyer-Frieze-Kannan '89; Bez\'akov\'a-\v{S}tefankovi\v{c}-Vazirani-Vigoda '08);
  $\bullet$ adaptive (sequential) algorithms with near-optimal cost (\v{S}tefankovi\v{c}-Vempala-Vigoda '09; Huber '15; Kolmogorov '18; Harris-Kolmogorov '24).
  We present an algorithm that achieves both near-optimal total work and efficient parallelism, providing a reduction from counting to sampling with logarithmic depth and near-optimal work. As consequences, we obtain work-efficient parallel counting algorithms for several important models, including the hardcore and Ising models within the uniqueness regime.</description>
