      <title>Trading-R1: Financial Trading with LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions. Trading-R1 Terminal will be released at https://github.com/TauricResearch/Trading-R1.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Feedback in Equity Markets: Asymmetries, Retail Heterogeneity, and Structural Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how sentiment shocks propagate through equity returns and investor clientele using four independent proxies with sign-aligned kappa-rho parameters. A structural calibration links a one standard deviation innovation in sentiment to a pricing impact of 1.06 basis points with persistence parameter rho = 0.940, yielding a half-life of 11.2 months. The impulse response peaks around the 12-month horizon, indicating slow-moving amplification. Cross-sectionally, a simple D10-D1 portfolio earns 4.0 basis points per month with Sharpe ratios of 0.18-0.85, consistent with tradable exposure to the sentiment factor. Three regularities emerge: (i) positive sentiment innovations transmit more strongly than negative shocks (amplification asymmetry); (ii) effects are concentrated in retail-tilted and non-optionable stocks (clientele heterogeneity); and (iii) responses are state-dependent across volatility regimes - larger on impact in high-VIX months but more persistent in low-VIX months. Baseline time-series fits are parsimonious (R2 ~ 0.001; 420 monthly observations), yet the calibrated dynamics reconcile modest impact estimates with sizable long-short payoffs. Consistent with Miller (1977), a one standard deviation sentiment shock has 1.72-8.69 basis points larger effects in low-breadth stocks across horizons of 1-12 months, is robust to institutional flows, and exhibits volatility state dependence - larger on impact but less persistent in high-VIX months, smaller on impact but more persistent in low-VIX months.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Liquidity in BTC-Denominated Prediction Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction markets have gained adoption as on-chain mechanisms for aggregating information, with platforms such as Polymarket demonstrating demand for stablecoin-denominated markets. However, denominating in non-interest-bearing stablecoins introduces inefficiencies: participants face opportunity costs relative to the fiat risk-free rate, and Bitcoin holders in particular lose exposure to BTC appreciation when converting into stablecoins. This paper explores the case for prediction markets denominated in Bitcoin, treating BTC as a deflationary settlement asset analogous to gold under the classical gold standard. We analyse three methods of supplying liquidity to a newly created BTC-denominated prediction market: cross-market making against existing stablecoin venues, automated market making, and DeFi-based redirection of user trades. For each approach we evaluate execution mechanics, risks (slippage, exchange-rate risk, and liquidation risk), and capital efficiency. Our analysis shows that cross-market making provides the most user-friendly risk profile, though it requires active professional makers or platform-subsidised liquidity. DeFi redirection offers rapid bootstrapping and reuse of existing USDC liquidity, but exposes users to liquidation thresholds and exchange-rate volatility, reducing capital efficiency. Automated market making is simple to deploy but capital-inefficient and exposes liquidity providers to permanent loss. The results suggest that BTC-denominated prediction markets are feasible, but their success depends critically on the choice of liquidity provisioning mechanism and the trade-off between user safety and deployment convenience.</description>

      <title>Equity Premium Prediction: Taking into Account the Role of Long, even Asymmetric, Swings in Stock Market Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through a novel approach, this paper shows that substantial change in stock market behavior has a statistically and economically significant impact on equity risk premium predictability both on in-sample and out-of-sample cases. In line with Auer's ''Bullish ratio'', a ''Bullish index'' is introduced to measure the changes in stock market behavior, which we describe through a ''fluctuation detrending moving average analysis'' (FDMAA) for returns. We consider 28 indicators. We find that a ''positive shock'' of the Bullish Index is closely related to strong equity risk premium predictability for forecasts based on macroeconomic variables for up to six months. In contrast, a ''negative shock'' is associated with strong equity risk premium predictability with adequate forecasts for up to nine months when based on technical indicators.</description>
