      <title>Evidence of Floquet electronic steady states in graphene under continuous-wave mid-infrared irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-induced phenomena in materials can exhibit exotic behavior that extends beyond equilibrium properties, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling electronic phases. So far, non-equilibrium phenomena in solids have been predominantly explored using femtosecond laser pulses, which generate transient, ultra-fast dynamics. Here, we investigate the steady non-equilibrium regime in graphene induced by a continuous-wave (CW) mid-infrared laser. Our transport measurements reveal signatures of a long-lived Floquet phase, where a non-equilibrium electronic population is stabilized by the interplay between coherent photoexcitation and incoherent phonon cooling. The observation of non-equilibrium steady states using CW lasers opens a new regime for low-temperature Floquet phenomena, paving the way toward Floquet engineering of steady-state phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic and Extrinsic $p$-type Dopability of Atomically Thin $\beta$-TeO$_2$ from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) $\beta$-TeO$_2$ has gained attention as a promising material for optoelectronic and power device applications, thanks to its transparency and high hole mobility. However, the underlying mechanism behind its $p$-type conductivity and dopability remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the intrinsic and extrinsic point defects in monolayer and bilayer $\beta$-TeO$_2$, the latter of which has been experimentally synthesized, using the HSE+D3 hybrid functional. Our results reveal that most intrinsic defects are unlikely to contribute to $p$-type doping in 2D $\beta$-TeO$_2$. Moreover, Si contamination could further impair $p$-type conductivity. Since the point defects do not contribute to $p$-type conductivity, we propose two possible mechanisms for hole conduction: hopping conduction via localized impurity states, and substrate effects. We also explored substitutional $p$-type doping in 2D $\beta$-TeO$_2$ with 10 trivalent elements. Among these, the Bi dopant is found to exhibit a relatively shallow acceptor transition level. However, most dopants tend to introduce deep localized states, where hole polarons become trapped at Te's lone pairs. Interestingly, monolayer $\beta$-TeO$_2$ shows potential advantages over bilayers due to reduced self-compensation effects for $p$-type dopants. These findings provide valuable insights into defect engineering strategies for future electronic applications involving 2D $\beta$-TeO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition in nonchiral Rice-Mele model with bond disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rice-Mele model consists of a one-dimensional lattice with two sublattice sites in each unit cell subjected to a staggered sublattice potential. The onsite potential constitutes a mass term that breaks chiral symmetry. In this paper, we show that a topological phase transition is induced in this model by disordering intracell and intercell hopping energies unequally. For small enough mass, the phase transition is accompanied by anomalous localization, which is accounted for in terms of geometric means of random variables. Anomalous localization is insusceptible to mass. In contrast, the critical disorder strength at which the phase transition takes place decreases as mass increases, and eventually becomes invariable for large enough mass. For large enough mass, we show that the phase transition is characterized by arithmetic means instead of geometric means.</description>

      <title>Wigner-function formalism for the detection of single microwave pulses in a resonator-coupled double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dots (DQD) coupled to superconducting microwave resonators offer a promising platform for the detection of single microwave photons. In previous works, the photodetection was studied for a monochromatic source of microwave photons. Here, we theoretically analyze the photodetection of single microwave pulses. The photodetection in this case can be seen as a non-linear filtering process of an incoming signal, the pulse, to an outgoing one, the photocurrent. This analogy to signal processing motivated the derivation of a Wigner-function formalism which provides a compelling visualization of the time and frequency properties of the photodetector for low intensities. We find a trade-off between detecting the time and the frequency of the incoming photons in agreement with the time-energy uncertainty relation. As the intensity of the source increases, the photodetection is influenced by coherent Rabi oscillations of the DQD. Our findings give insight into the time-dependent properties of microwave photons interacting with electrons in a DQD-resonator hybrid system and provide guidance for experiments on single microwave pulse detection.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous study of acoustic and optic phonon scattering of electrons and holes in undoped $\mathrm{GaAs}$/$\mathrm{Al_{x} Ga_{1-x} As}$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of phonon coupling in doped semiconductors via electrical transport measurements is challenging due to unwanted temperature-induced effects such as dopant ionisation and parallel conduction. Here, we study phonon scattering in 2D electrons and holes in the $1.6-92.5$K range without the use of extrinsic doping, where both acoustic and longitudinal optic (LO) phonons come into effect. We use undoped GaAs/$\mathrm{Al_{x} Ga_{1-x} As}$ heterostructures and examine the temperature dependence of the sample resistivity, extracting phonon coupling constants and the LO activation energy. Our results are consistent with results obtained through approaches other than transport measurements, and highlight the benefit of this approach for studying electron-phonon and hole-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topology in the quantum Hall effect of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall phases have recently emerged as a platform to investigate non-Hermitian topology in condensed-matter systems. This platform is particularly interesting due to its tunability, which allows to modify the properties and topology of the investigated non-Hermitian phases by tuning external parameters of the system such as the magnetic field. Here, we show the tunability of non-Hermitian topology chirality in a graphene heterostructure using a gate voltage. By changing the charge carrier density, we unveil some novel properties specific to different quantum Hall regimes. First, we find that the best quantization of the non-Hermitian topological invariant is interestingly obtained at very high filling factor rather than on well-quantized quantum Hall plateaus. This is of particular importance for the efficient operation of devices based on non-Hermitian topology. Moreover, we observe an additional non-Hermitian topological phase in the insulating nu=0 quantum Hall plateau, which survives at lower fields than the opening of the nu=0 gap, confirming a recent prediction of a disorder-induced trivial phase. Our results evidence graphene as a promising platform for the study of non-Hermitian physics and of emergent phases in such topological devices.</description>

      <title>Metastability in individual magnetic vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles play a crucial role in different fields such as biomedicine or information and quantum technologies. These applications require nanoparticles with a single, well-defined energy minimum, free of metastable states, and characterized by narrow switching field distributions. Here, we demonstrate that high-transition-temperature nanoSQUIDs can be successfully applied to the characterization of individual nanodiscs hosting magnetic vortices. We present measurements performed under varying temperature and external magnetic field, revealing signatures of ubiquitous, multiple metastable configurations. We also demonstrate that metastability can be reduced by introducing an intended asymmetry. NanoSQUID measurements can be applied to optimize the fabrication of on-demand spin-texture states, such as degenerated vortices or particles with fixed circulation and deterministic and narrow switching probabilities.</description>

      <title>Pull-in features of nanoswitches in the Casimir regime with account of contact repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cantilever tip of a nanoswitch in close proximity to the ground plate is considered with account of electrostatic, elastic, van der Waals (Casimir), and also contact repulsive forces. The van der Waals (Casimir) and contact repulsive forces are computed for a Si cantilever and either Au or Ni ground plates using the Lifshitz theory and the method of pairwise summation with account of surface roughness. It is shown that at short separations an impact of the van der Waals (Casimir) force leads to the pull-in and collapse of a cantilever onto the ground plate if the contact repulsion is disregarded. Taking into consideration contact repulsion, the nanoswitch is demonstrated to have the stable cyclic behavior with no pull-in when switching voltage on and off.</description>

      <title>Beam dynamics induced by the quantum metric of exceptional rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological physics has broadened its scope from the study of topological insulating phases to include nodal phases containing band structure singularities. The geometry of the corresponding quantum states is described by the quantum metric which provides a theoretical framework for explaining phenomena that conventional approaches fail to address. The field has become even broader by encompassing non-Hermitian singularities: in addition to Dirac, Weyl nodes, or nodal lines, it is now common to encounter exceptional points, exceptional or Weyl rings, and even Weyl spheres. They give access to fascinating effects that cannot be reached within the Hermitian picture. However, the quantum geometry of non-Hermitian singularities is not a straightforward extension of the Hermitian one, remaining far less understood. Here, we study experimentally and theoretically the dynamics of wave packets at exceptional rings stemming from Dirac points in a photonic honeycomb lattice. First, we demonstrate a transition between conical diffraction and non-Hermitian broadening in real space. Next, we predict and demonstrate a new non-Hermitian effect in the reciprocal space, induced by the non-orthogonality of the eigenstates. We call it transverse non-Hermitian drift, and its description requires biorthogonal quantum metric. The non-Hermitian drift can be used for applications in beam steering.</description>

      <title>Hidden topology in flat-band topological insulators: strong, weak and square-root topological states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study a previously unexplored class of topological states protected by hidden chiral symmetries that are local, that is, that protect against any off-diagonal disorder. We derive their related topological invariant for the first time, and show that these previously unidentified symmetries can act together with standard chiral symmetries to increase the protection of the end modes, using the Creutz ladder as an example. Finally, thanks to local hidden symmetries, we show that the diamond necklace chain can have three different types of topological end modes: strong, weak or square-root, with some of the states inheriting their topology from others. This marks the first time a square-root topological insulator is identified as its own parent.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and violations of bulk-edge correspondence in a hydrodynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence is a wide-ranging principle that applies to topological matter, as well as a precise result established in a large and growing number of cases. According to the principle, the distinctive topological properties of matter, thought of as extending indefinitely in space, are equivalently reflected in the excitations running along its boundary, when one is present. Indices encode those properties, and their values, when differing, are witness to a violation of that correspondence. We address such violations, as they are encountered in a hydrodynamic context. The model concerns a shallow layer of fluid in a rotating frame and provides a local description of waves propagating either across the oceans or along a coastline; it becomes topological when suitably modified at short distances. The edge index is sensitive to boundary conditions, as exemplified in earlier work, hence exhibiting a violation. Here we present classification of all (local, self-adjoint) boundary conditions and a parameterization of their manifold. They come in four families, distinguished in part by the degree of their underlying differential operators. Essentially, that degree counts the degrees of freedom of the hydrodynamic field that are constrained at the boundary by way of their normal derivatives. Generally, both the correspondence and its violation are typical. Within families though, the maximally possible amount of violation is increasing with its degree. Several indices of interest are charted for all boundary conditions. A single spectral mechanism for the onset of violations is furthermore identified. The role of a symmetry is investigated.</description>

      <title>CUT-E as a $1/N$ expansion for multiscale molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular polaritons arise when the collective coupling between an ensemble of $N$ molecules and an optical mode exceeds individual photon and molecular linewidths. The complexity of their description stems from their multiscale nature, where the local dynamics on each molecule can, in principle, be influenced by the collective behavior of the entire ensemble. To address this, we previously introduced a formalism called collective dynamics using truncated equations (CUT-E). CUT-E approaches the problem in two stages. First, it exploits permutational symmetries to obtain a substantial simplification of the problem. However, this is often insufficient for parameter regimes relevant to most experiments. Second, it takes the exact solution of the problem in the $N\to\infty$ limit as a reference and derives systematic $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ corrections. Here we provide a novel derivation of CUT-E based on recently developed bosonization techniques. We lay down its connections with $1/N$ expansions that are ubiquitous in other fields of physics, and present previously unexplored key aspects of this formalism, including various types of approximations and extensions to high excitation manifolds.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Properties of Two-Dimensional Lepidocrocite Titanium Dioxide Based Heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures reveal novel physicochemical phenomena at different length scales, that are highly desirable for technological applications. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures constructed by stacking 2D TiO2 and 2D MoSSe monolayers to form TiO2-MoSSe heterojunction. The heterostructure formation is found to be exothermic, indicating stability. We find that by varying the atomic species at the interfaces the electronic structure can be considerably altered, due to the differences in charge transfer, arising from the inherent electronegativity of the atoms. We demonstrate that the heterostructures possess a type II or type III band alignment, depending on the atomic termination of MoSSe at the interface. The observed charge transfer occurs from MoSSe to TiO2. Our results suggest that Janus interface enables the tuning of electronic properties, providing understanding of the possible applications of the TiO2-MoSSe heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Plasma-Metal Junction:A Junction With Negative Turn-On Voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike junctions in solid-state devices, a plasma-metal junction (pm-junction) is a junction of classical and quantum electrons. The plasma electrons are Maxwellain in nature, while metal electrons obey the Fermi-Dirac distribution. In this experiment, the current-voltage characteristics of solid-state devices that form homo or hetero-junction are compared to the pm-junction. Observation shows that the turn-on voltage for pn-junction is 0.5V and decreases to 0.24V for metal-semiconductor junction. However, the pm-junction's turn-on voltage was lowered to a negative value of -7.0V. The devices with negative turn-on voltage are suitable for high-frequency operations. Further, observations show that the current-voltage characteristics of the pm-junction depend on the metal's work function, and the turn-on voltage remains unchanged. This result validates the applicability of the energy-band model for the pm-junction. We present a perspective metal-oxide-plasma (MOP), a gaseous electronic device, as an alternative to metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS), based on the new understanding developed.</description>

      <title>Side-gate modulation of supercurrent in InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InSb nanoflags, due to their intrinsic spin-orbit interactions, are an interesting platform in the study of planar Josephson junctions. Ballistic transport, combined with high transparency of the superconductor/semiconductor interfaces, was reported to lead to interesting phenomena such as the Josephson diode effect. The versatility offered by the planar geometry can be exploited to manipulate both carrier concentration and spin-orbit strength by electrical means. Here we present experimental results on InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions fabricated with side-gates placed in close proximity to the junction. We show that side-gates can efficiently modulate the current through the junction, both in the dissipative and in the dissipation-less regimes, similarly to what obtained with a conventional back-gate. Furthermore, the side-gates can be used to influence the Fraunhofer interference pattern induced by the presence of an external out-of-plane magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quantum information capacity in a 1D topological system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</description>

      <title>Controlling Goos-H\"anchen shifts in phosphorene via barrier and well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of the double potentials (barrier, well) on the Goos-H\"anchen (GH) shifts in phosphorene. We determine the solutions of the energy spectrum associated with the five regions that make up our system. By studying the phase shifts, we find that the GH shifts are highly sensitive to the incident energy, the $y$ directional wave vector, the potential heights and widths. To validate our findings, we perform a numerical analysis of the GH shifts as a function of the transmission probability under various conditions. In particular, we observe a consistent pattern in which a positive peak in the GH shift is always followed by a negative valley, a behavior evident at all potential height values. Notably, the energies at which the GH shift changes sign coincide exactly with the points at which transmission drops to zero. In particular, the transmission resonances that occur just before and just after the transmission gap region are strongly correlated with the points at which the GH shift changes sign. This study advances our understanding of how the double potential influences the GH shift behaviors in phosphorene. The ability to fine-tune the GH shifts by changing system parameters suggests potential applications in optical and electronic devices using this two-dimensional material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the celebrated Stern-Gerlach experiment an inhomogeneous static magnetic field separates a beam of charge-neutral atoms with opposite spins, thereby driving a ``spin current" normal to the propagation direction. Here we generalize it to the dynamic scenario by demonstrating a spin transfer between an AC inhomogeneous magnetic field and intraband electrons or charge-neutral excitons and phonons. We predict that parametric pumping can efficiently radiate their DC spin currents from local AC magnetic sources with van der Waals semiconductors as prototypes. This mechanism brings a unified and efficient paradigm in the spin transport of distinct mobile carriers.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in a singular flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the search of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, the conventional wisdom is to start from a flat Chern band isolated from the rest of the Hilbert space by band gaps, so that many-body interaction can be projected to a landscape that mimics a Landau level. Singular flat bands (SFB), which share protected touching points with other dispersive bands, represent another type of flat landscapes differing from Landau levels and Chern bands in topological and geometric properties. Here we report the finding of FQAH phases in a SFB, which emerges in the bipartite limit of the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. At 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the SFB, FQAH effects are demonstrated using density matrix renormalisation group calculations with all bands, as well as exact diagonalization calculations with the two touching bands. Gapping the band touching can turn the SFB into a nearly flat Chern band, but counter-intuitively this suppresses the FQAH effect, as the gap opening introduces strong inhomogeneity to the quantum geometry. An optical scheme to realize such SFB for cold atoms is provided. Our findings uncover a new arena for the exploration of fractional quantum Hall physics beyond the Landau level and Chern insulator paradigms.</description>

      <title>Circuit QED theory of direct and dual Shapiro steps with finite-size transmission line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of direct and dual Shapiro steps for a Josephson junction coupled to a finite-size transmission line resonator. We treat both problems through a circuit QED approach with a large, but finite number of photon modes. For the dual case, we do not assume the (approximate) charge-phase duality, but include the full multi-band dynamics for the Josephson junction. Mean-field equations within such Hamiltonian approach reproduce the result obtained through a dissipative classical equation when the number of transmission line modes is large enough. To account for quantum and thermal fluctuations, we go beyond the mean-field treatment within a truncated Wigner approach. The fluctuations are shown to modify both the direct and the dual steps. We show how the dual steps are very sensitive to these fluctuations and identify the key physical parameters for the junction and the transmission line controlling their robustness, which is essential for applications to close the quantum metrological triangle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-dimensional chain of elongated anisotropic magnetic islands on a nonmagnetic substrate with dipolar interactions and an applied magnetic field transverse to the chain is considered. With the long axes of the islands perpendicular to the chain, the system allows for three uniform metastable states: (1) tilted dipoles with magnetization at an oblique angle to the chain, (2) transverse dipoles with magnetization perpendicular to the chain, and (3) alternating transverse dipoles with no net magnetization. The uniform magnetic field controls their stabilities and is analyzed for its ability to cause transitions among the states. The energy and frequency eigenvalues are determined for small-amplitude traveling wave deviations of the dipoles. The results are summarized in a phase diagram in the field/anisotropy plane, that highlights the multistable properties of this type of system.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Induced Cooling in Double Quantum Dots: Achieving Millikelvin Temperatures to Reduce Thermal Noise around Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a leading technology due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, maintaining these qubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems. This paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling system, where the DQDs act as refrigerants to reduce the local phonon environment around computational qubits. The cooling process occurs in two distinct stages: the first step involves microwave-induced state depopulation combined with fast cyclic detuning to transfer the DQD's population to the ground state, effectively lowering the DQD's temperature. In the second step, the cooled DQD interacts with and absorbs phonons resonant with the DQD spin energy, thereby filtering out these phonons that contribute to spin-lattice relaxation in the surrounding environment. This study focuses on the first step, presenting detailed calculations and numerical results that demonstrate the feasibility of achieving local DQD temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The sensitivity of the cooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic return time is analyzed, while the phonon filtering in the second step will require further investigation.</description>

      <title>Classification of Higher-Order Van Hove Singularities in Kagome Topological Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in band structures featuring higher-order Van Hove singularities (HOVHS), we investigate a spinless fermion kagome system characterized by nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping amplitudes. While NN hopping preserves time-reversal symmetry, NNN hopping, akin to chiral hopping on the Haldane lattice, breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to the formation of topological bands with Chern numbers ranging from $C = \pm 1$ to $C = \pm 4$. We perform analytical and numerical analysis of the energy bands near the high-symmetry points $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}$, $\pm \boldsymbol{K}$, and $\boldsymbol{M_i}$ ($i=1,2,3$), which uncover a rich and complex landscape of HOVHS, controlled by the magnitude and phase of the NNN hopping. We observe power-law divergences in the density of states (DOS), $\rho(\epsilon) \sim |\epsilon|^{-\nu}$, with exponents $\nu = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4$, which can significantly affect the anomalous Hall response at low temperatures when the Fermi level crosses the HOVHS. Additionally, the NNN hopping induces the formation of higher Chern number bands $C = \pm 2, \pm 4$ in the middle of the spectrum obeying a sublattice interference whereupon electronic states are maximally localized in each of the sublattices when the momentum approaches the three high-symmetry points $\boldsymbol{M_i}$ ($i=1,2,3$) on the Brillouin zone boundary. This classification of HOVHS in kagome systems provides a platform to explore unconventional electronic orders induced by electronic correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time evolution of topological systems is an active area of interest due to their expected applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we analyze the dynamics of a noninteracting spinless fermion chain in its topological phase, quenched out of equilibrium by a Hamiltonian belonging to the same symmetry class. Due to particle-hole symmetry, the bulk properties of the system remain intact throughout its evolution. However, the boundary properties may be drastically altered, with the initially localized Majorana edge modes extending across the chain. Up to a timescale $t^*$, identified by area-law behavior of the entanglement entropy, these extended edge modes are an example of exotic effects in topological systems out of equilibrium. Further, while local disorder can be utilized to preserve localization and increase $t^*$, we still identify nontrivial dynamics in the Majorana polarization and Loschmidt echo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of detection of microwave photons with a flux qubit-based detector is presented. We consider semiclassical approximation with the electromagnetic field being in a coherent state. Flux qubit is considered as a multilevel quantum system (qudit). By solving the Lindblad equation, we describe the time evolution of occupations of the qudit's levels for readout and reset stages of detection. When considering the reset stage, the time evolution is described by multiple avoided-level crossings, thus providing a multilevel Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) problem. In addition to numerical calculations, we present an approximate solution for the description of the reset stage dynamics based on the adiabatic-impulse approximation and rate equation approach. Our theory may be useful for the theoretical description of driven-dissipative dynamics of qudits, including applications such as single-photon detection.</description>

      <title>Topological Heavy Fermion Principle For Flat (Narrow) Bands With Concentrated Quantum Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general principle for the low-energy theory of narrow bands with concentrated Berry curvature and Fubini-Study metric in the form of a map to Anderson-"+" models composed of heavy fermions hybridizing and interacting with semi-metallic modes. This map resolves the obstruction preventing topological bands from being realized in a local Hamiltonian acting on the low-energy degrees of freedom. The concentrated quantum geometry is reproduced through band inversion with a dispersive semi-metal, leaving a nearly flat, trivial band which becomes the heavy fermion. This representation is natural when the narrow band is not energetically isolated on the scale of the interaction and an enlarged Hilbert space is inescapable, but also provides analytical insight into the projected-interaction limit. First exemplified in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we extend it to (1) the twisted checkerboard, which we find has a chiral symmetric stable anomaly that forbids a lattice realization at all energies, and (2) the Lieb lattice with gapless flat bands, where we show the heavy fermions can be obtained by minimizing a Euclidean instanton action to saturate its BPS bound. The heavy fermion approach is widely applicable and physically transparent: heavy electrons carry the strong correlations and dispersive electrons carry the topology. This simple picture unifies the dichotomous phenomena observed in TBG and points to connections between moir\'e and stoichiometric materials.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of low-energy matter properties such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity via cavity quantum electrodynamics engineering has been suggested as a way to enhance these many-body collective phenomena. In this work, we investigate the effective interactions between low-energy matter excitations induced by the off-resonant coupling with cavity electromagnetic modes. We extend previous work by going beyond the dipole approximation accounting for the full polarization and magnetization densities of matter. We further include the often neglected diamagnetic interaction and, for the cavity, we consider general linear absorbing media with possibly non-local and non-reciprocal response. We demonstrate that, even in this general scenario, the effective cavity-induced interactions between the matter degrees of freedom are of electrostatic and magnetostatic nature. This confirms the necessity of a multimode description for cavity engineering of matter systems where the low-energy assumption holds. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for studying the influence of general optical environments on extended low-energy matter excitations.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly modifies conserved currents, introducing new contributions. For Maxwell gauge fields, this leads to a contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral magnetic effect, which is widely discussed in the literature. In the case of gravitational fields, as we demonstrate, the anomaly induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the potential manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and hydrodynamics in chiral media, and we also comment on backreaction effects in electrodynamics. In each case, we observe the systematic appearance of Beltrami-type fields. In electrodynamics and hydrodynamics, a Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector parallel to its own curl. We propose a generalization of Beltrami fields for tensorial gravitational perturbations, calling the respective solutions to the gravitational equations gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics of chiral media, vorticity asymptotically forms a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09353</link>

Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <title>Tuning Electric Polarization via Exchange Striction Interaction in CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ by Sr-Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate polarization contributions from both thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) and intrinsic magnetically induced electric polarization. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.</description>
