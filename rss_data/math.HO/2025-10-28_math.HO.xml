      <title>Derangements and Generalizations: A Counting Note on the Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a concise historical background to Montmort's matching problem and its modern variants such as the hat-check problem, then develop a unified counting framework for fixed-point-free allocations. Using elementary recurrence and inclusion-exclusion arguments, we derive closed forms for derangements, rectangular injections, and partial l-matchings, and we combine them into a single formula. We also provide exact counts for the number of fixed points and Poisson limit laws. This note thus offers a compact, self-contained synthesis linking classical results with their two principal generalizations in a single scheme.</description>

      <title>The Mathematisation of the World: Uncovering the Socio-Economic Tensions for Ethics in Mathematics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematisation of the socio-economic sphere, where mathematics actively constructs social reality, presents a challenge for studies on ethics in mathematics and its education. While existing scholarship on ethics in mathematics offers insights, it often remains philosophically driven and disconnected from other relevant disciplines. This paper addresses this gap by asking how debates on ethics in mathematics and its education can be connected with economic sociology, and what socio-economic tensions become visible through this connection. Drawing from concepts such as imagined futures, varieties of capitalism, and variegated capitalism, we synthesise a new perspective. This analysis reveals six interconnected tensions: a socio-economic valuation gap regarding ethics education; the multifaceted implementation of mathematics across different capitalist systems; its material opaqueness; a growing gap between economic power and social unaccountability; the enclosure of imagination limiting sustainable futures; and the erosion of multilateralism, which challenges critical pedagogy. The paper's contribution is a first step towards a structural socio-economic framework that links the limited literature on ethics in mathematics with these broader sociological perspectives.</description>

      <title>Fraudulent Publishing in Mathematics: A European Call to Action and How Information Infrastructure Can Help</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IMU-ICIAM working group's new report on Fraudulent Publishing in the Mathematical Sciences documents how gaming of bibliometrics, predatory outlets and paper-mill activity are eroding trust in research, mathematics included. This short EMS note brings that analysis home to Europe. We urge readers to recognise the warning signs of fraudulent publishing, to report serious irregularities so that they can be investigated and sanctioned, and to reflect critically on their own editorial and reviewing practices. We then sketch why Europe is well placed to lead a structural response: a decade of policy development on open science; mature infrastructures for data, software and scholarly communication; and new capacity for community-led diamond open access. Finally, we outline developments towards non-print contributions across member countries including the growth of formal proofs (e.g. with Lean and Isabelle) and we highlight the role of zbMATH Open as a European quality signal that can help editors, reviewers and authors steer clear of problematic venues.</description>

      <title>Hegel and Modern Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02367v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we sketch how some fundamental concepts of modern topology (as well as logic and category theory) can be understood philosophically in the light of Hegel's Science Logic as well how modern topological concepts can provide concrete illustrations of many of the concepts and deductions that Hegel used. Also these modern concepts can in turn be very powerful hermeneutic tools permitting a more rigorous and thorough grasp of Hegelian concepts. This paper can be seen as a continuation of our paper \cite{pro} where we argued that the prototypes of many fundamental notions of modern topology were already found in Aristotle's Physics. More generally it is hoped that this note makes a case for the possibility of a rigorous enriching interaction and mutual support between philosophy on one hand and modern logic and mathematics on the other. This paper is obviously meant only as a preliminary sketch and to offer some motivation for exploring in a more detailed and thorough way the subjects discussed.</description>

      <title>Analysis and X-ray tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.06557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are lecture notes for the course "Analysis and X-ray tomography". The course is a broad overview of various tools in analysis that can be used to study X-ray tomography. The focus is on tools and ideas, not so much on technical details and minimal assumptions. Only very basic functional analysis is assumed as background. Exercise problems are included.</description>
