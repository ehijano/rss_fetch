      <title>Categories of Games and their Fra\"iss\'e Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relying on recent generalizations of the Fra\"iss\'e theory to a broader category-theoretic context, we study the class of abstract finite games played between two players and show the existence of an infinitetly countable game which is ultrahomogeneous and universal with respect to said class. Certain peculiarities of our game categories which clash with the usual framework found in the literature then lead us to formulate weaker category-theoretic properties which still yield a universal and ultrahomogeneous Fra\"iss\'e limit, thus further generalizing the categorical framework for a Fra\"iss\'e theory.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Arithmetical Structure and Distribution of Lucky Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we will use elementary number theory techniques to investigate a sequence of integers defined by a sifting process called the lucky numbers. Ulam introduced lucky numbers as a sieve-based analogue of prime numbers. We derive an exact formula for the $n$th lucky number, providing a new tool for quantitative analysis. We formulate and prove a version of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for lucky numbers. This theorem provides an entirely new viewpoint on number theory. Building on the fundamental theorem, we introduce foundational definitions and analogues of arithmetical functions. Additionally, we prove an analogue of Bertrand's postulate for lucky numbers. Finally, we use the formula for the $n$th lucky number to prove a new result on the order of magnitude of the gaps between consecutive lucky numbers. We obtain an asymptotic bound that is much stronger than the best known bound for primes, and therefore obtain the first result that is known for lucky numbers but still conjectured to be true for primes. Together, these results establish a foundation for the arithmetic theory of lucky numbers and contribute to a broader understanding of sieve-generated sequences.</description>

      <title>Least Absolute Deviation Utility for Trapezoidal Fuzzy Preference Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference relations (PRs) are widely used to model expert judgments because they allow for eliciting the decision-makers' opinions from pairwise comparisons. Traditionally, PRs have been elicited using real numbers. However, in real-world decision-makers usually feel more comfortable using linguistic expressions closer to natural language. In this context, our purpose is to extend the classical idea of PR into the environment of Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers (TrFNs) by addressing several drawbacks in current research. Existing fuzzy extensions for Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPRs) and Multiplicative Preference Relations (MPRs) assume that the notion of neutrality must be modeled by a crisp real number, which fails to capture the subjective and diverse ways in which decision-makers may perceive indifference. Moreover, current research lacks a theoretical framework that unifies both FPRs and MPRs for fuzzy numbers and simultaneously generalizes the involved classical notions (e.g., reciprocity, consistency) from the perspective of fuzzy arithmetic. Therefore, we introduce the notion of neutral TrFN, a fuzzy number that can model indifference on a certain fuzzy scale. This provides a flexible representation of neutrality, leading to a more realistic extension of PRs into the fuzzy environment. Building upon this, we propose the Trapezoidal FPR (TrFPR), analyze its properties and how reciprocity and consistency are extended using fuzzy arithmetic. Furthermore, we introduce the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) utility vector associated with a consistent TrFPR and develop an optimization model to derive it from an inconsistent TrFPR to compute priority values. These ideas are also extended to MPRs in the fuzzy domain. Finally, the applicability of the proposed LAD utility method is demonstrated in evaluating land development projects, where comparison with fuzzy AHP illustrates its superiority.</description>

      <title>A flow and transport model for simulation of microbial enhanced oil recovery processes at core scale and laboratory conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general 3D flow-and-transport model in porous media is derived using an axiomatic continuum-mechanics approach and implemented with the finite element method to simulate microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) at core scale under laboratory conditions. The development pipeline (conceptual -&gt; mathematical -&gt; numerical -&gt; computational) is detailed. The model captures clogging/declogging from biomass, changes in interfacial tension due to biosurfactant, and the resulting impact on relative permeability, capillary pressure, and residual oil saturation via a trapping-number framework. The flow model is validated (Buckley-Leverett and coreflood benchmarks); transport (microbes/nutrients/surfactant) is validated against Hendry et al. 1997 breakthrough data. Finally, the model accurately predicts a Berea-core MEOR case study using field microbes and brine, matching recovery histories with small RMS error. Owing to its generality, the framework can be extended to other EOR scenarios and constitutive laws.</description>

      <title>Two-Channel Filter Banks on Joint Time-Vertex Graphs with Oversampled Graph Laplacian Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the limitations of conventional critically sampled graph filter banks in joint time-vertex signal processing, which require decomposing the joint graph into bipartite subgraphs and thus cannot fully exploit all temporal and spatial edges in a single-stage transform, we introduce the joint time-vertex oversampled graph Laplacian matrix. This operator enables the construction of bipartite extensions that preserve all edges of the original joint graph and supports redundant multiresolution representations. Based on this operator, we design two-channel joint time-vertex oversampled graph filter banks and develop efficient oversampling extensions using a $K$-coloring strategy. The proposed framework is applied to both graph signal and image/video denoising, modeling images as graph signals to leverage structural relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in decomposition, reconstruction, and denoising, achieving notable performance improvements over critically sampled and existing methods.</description>

      <title>Inner products for strongly regular near-vector spaces and duality for finite dimensional near-vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a duality theory for all finite-dimensional near-vector spaces and introduce a notion of inner product tailored to the broad and natural class of strongly regular near-vector spaces. This generalized construction extends the classical inner product beyond the classical framework, yielding rich families of examples on multiplicative near-vector spaces. Within this setting, several familiar norms-such as those that fail to produce Hilbert spaces in the classical sense-emerge naturally as genuine inner-product-type norms. A further contribution is the extension of the theory of generalized (weighted) means to arbitrary complex datasets. This extension unifies and generalizes the classical power and geometric means, carrying them beyond the domain of positive reals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19867v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we derive and evaluate some infinite integrals involving the product of a generalized logarithm and polynomial functions in the denominator. These integrals are expressed in terms of finite series involving the Hurwitz-Lerch zeta function. We produce special cases of these integrals in terms of other special functions and fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>A Sieve on Rational Imbalances and the First Appearance of Denominators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a sieve that enumerates rational ``imbalances'' of the form $(p-q)/(p+q)$ for integers $p\ge2$ and $1\le q&lt;p$, ordered lexicographically by $(p,q)$. Each imbalance is reduced to lowest terms, and we record the sequence of distinct denominators as they first appear.
  We show that every positive integer occurs exactly once as such a denominator, and that its first appearance coincides with the unit fraction $1/d$.
  We then prove that the sieve, when viewed as a map from pairs $(p,q)$ to reduced fractions, enumerates all rational numbers in $(-1,1)$ without repetition, extend it symmetrically to all of $\mathbb{Q}$, and discuss its connections to hyperbolic geometry and rational enumeration theory.</description>

      <title>Sine laws on semigroups with an anti-automorphism: A left-translation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stetk\ae r's matrix method is a useful tool for analyzing functional equations on semigroups involving a homomorphism $\sigma$. However, this method fails when $\sigma$ is an anti-automorphism because the underlying right-regular representation reverses composition order. To resolve this, we introduce a new approach based on a key conjugation identity. Let $J$ denote the operator of composition with $\sigma$; then the identity $J R(\sigma(y)) J = L(y)$ provides the foundation for our method. This identity restores a well-behaved representation via left translations, making the matrix method applicable again. This left-translation approach is illustrated with several concrete examples from matrix groups and symmetric groups. Using this approach, we extend Stetk\ae r's main structural theorem for the generalized sine law on semigroups to the anti-automorphic setting. For linearly independent solutions, we show that the equation implies a simpler addition law and that the solutions obey the same transformation rules ($f\circ\sigma=\beta f$, etc.) as in the homomorphic case.</description>
