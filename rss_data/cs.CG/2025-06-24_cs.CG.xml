      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the Plane with Four Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The translational tiling problem, dated back to Wang's domino problem in the 1960s, is one of the most representative undecidable problems in the field of discrete geometry and combinatorics. Ollinger initiated the study of the undecidability of translational tiling with a fixed number of tiles in 2009, and proved that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $11$ polyominoes is undecidable. The number of polyominoes needed to obtain undecidability was reduced from $11$ to $7$ by Yang and Zhang, and then to $5$ by Kim. We show that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $4$ (disconnected) polyominoes is undecidable in this paper.</description>

      <title>Fractality of Wireless Mesh Networks: Dimensional Effects on Network Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) depend on the spatial distribution of nodes, which directly influences connectivity, routing efficiency, and overall network performance. Conventional models typically assume uniform or random node placement, which inadequately represent the complex, hierarchical spatial patterns observed in practical deployments. In this study, we present a novel algorithm that constructs WMN topologies with tunable fractal dimensions, allowing precise control over spatial self-similarity. By systematically varying the fractal dimension, the algorithm generates network layouts spanning a continuum of spatial complexities, ranging from sparse fragmented clusters to dense, cohesive structures. Through NS-3 simulations, Key performance metrics including throughput, latency, jitter, and packet delivery ratio were evaluated across a range of fractal dimensions. Comparative evaluations against classical random, small-world, and scale-free network models reveal that high-dimensional fractal topologies achieve enhanced resilience and throughput under equivalent conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fractal geometry as a design paradigm for scalable and efficient WMN architectures.</description>

      <title>The CompGIT package: a computational tool for Geometric Invariant Theory quotie</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe CompGIT, a SageMath package to describe Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) quotients of projective space by simple groups. The implementation is based on algorithms described by Gallardo--Martinez-Garcia--Moon--Swinarski. In principle the package is sufficient to describe any GIT quotient of a projective variety by a simple group -- in practice it requires that the user can construct an equivariant embedding of the polarised variety into projective space. The package describes the non-stable and unstable loci up to conjugation by the group, as well as describing the strictly polystable loci. We discuss potential applications of the outputs of CompGIT to algebraic geometry problems, a well as suggesting directions for future developments.</description>

      <title>Subcoloring of (Unit) Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subcoloring of a graph is a partition of its vertex set into subsets (called colors), each inducing a disjoint union of cliques. It is a natural generalization of the classical proper coloring, in which each color must instead induce an independent set. Similarly to proper coloring, we define the subchromatic number of a graph as the minimum integer k such that it admits a subcoloring with k colors, and the corresponding problem k-Subcoloring which asks whether a graph has subchromatic number at most k. In this paper, we initiate the study of the subcoloring of (unit) disk graphs. One motivation stems from the fact that disk graphs can be seen as a dense generalization of planar graphs where, intuitively, each vertex can be blown into a large clique--much like subcoloring generalizes proper coloring. Interestingly, it can be observed that every unit disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most 7 colors. We first prove that the subchromatic number can be 3-approximated in polynomial-time in unit disk graphs. We then present several hardness results for special cases of unit disk graphs which somehow prevents the use of classical approaches for improving this result. We show in particular that 2-subcoloring remains NP-hard in triangle-free unit disk graphs, as well as in unit disk graphs representable within a strip of bounded height. We also solve an open question of Broersma, Fomin, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, and Woeginger (2002) by proving that 3-Subcoloring remains NP-hard in co-comparability graphs. Finally, we prove that every $n$-vertex disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most $O(\log^3(n))$ colors and present a $O(\log^2(n))$-approximation algorithm for computing the subchromatic number of such graphs. This is achieved by defining a decomposition and a special type of co-comparability disk graph, called $\Delta$-disk graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Origami flip graph of the $2\times n$ Miura-ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an origami crease pattern $C=(V,E)$, a straight-line planar graph embedded in a region of $\mathbb{R}^2$, we assign each crease to be either a mountain crease (which bends convexly) or a valley crease (which bends concavely), creating a mountain-valley (MV) assignment $\mu:E\to\{-1,1\}$. An MV assignment $\mu$ is locally valid if the faces around each vertex in $C$ can be folded flat under $\mu$. In this paper, we investigate locally valid MV assignments of the Miura-ori, $M_{m,n}$, an $m\times n$ parallelogram tessellation used in numerous engineering applications. The origami flip graph $OFG(C)$ of $C$ is a graph whose vertices are locally valid MV assignments of $C$, and two vertices are adjacent if they differ by a face flip, an operation that swaps the MV-parity of every crease bordering a given face of $C$. We enumerate the number of vertices and edges in $OFG(M_{2,n})$ and prove several facts about the degrees of vertices in $OFG(M_{2,n})$. By finding recurrence relations, we show that the number of vertices of degree $d$ and $2n-a$ (for $0\leq a$) are both described by polynomials of particular degrees. We then prove that the diameter of $OFG(M_{2,n})$ is $\lceil \frac{n^2}{2}\rceil$ using techniques from 3-coloring reconfiguration graphs.</description>

      <title>Skeletal Cut Loci on Convex Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a convex polyhedron P, the cut locus C(x) with respect to a point x is a tree of geodesic segments (shortest paths) on P that includes every vertex. We say that P has a skeletal cut locus if there is some x in P such that C(x) subset Sk(P), where Sk(P) is the 1-skeleton of P. At a first glance, there seems to be very little relation between the cut locus and the 1-skeleton, as the first one is an intrinsic geometry notion, and the second one specifies the combinatorics of P.
  In this paper we study skeletal cut loci, obtaining four main results. First, given any combinatorial tree T, there exists a convex polyhedron P and a point x in P with a cut locus that lies in Sk(P), and whose combinatorics match T. Second, any (non-degenerate) polyhedron P has at most a finite number of points x for which C(x) subset Sk(P). Third, we show that almost all polyhedra have no skeletal cut locus. Fourth, we provide a combinatorial restriction to the existence of skeletal cut loci.
  Because the source unfolding of P with respect to x is always a non-overlapping net for P, and because the boundary of the source unfolding is the (unfolded) cut locus, source unfoldings of polyhedra with skeletal cut loci are edge-unfoldings, and moreover "blooming," avoiding self-intersection during an unfolding process. We also explore partially skeletal cut loci, leading to partial edge-unfoldings; i.e., unfoldings obtained by cutting along some polyhedron edges and cutting some non-edges.</description>
