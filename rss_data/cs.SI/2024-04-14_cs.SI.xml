      <title>The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-19 Infections Among Dutch Students: A Study Using Population-Level Registry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of different social interactions is key to improving epidemic models. Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period.
  Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\%, and 4.7--7.9\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\%) and school-level (34\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.</description>

      <title>Interest Maximization in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, organizations use viral marketing strategies to promote their products through social networks. It is expensive to directly send the product promotional information to all the users in the network. In this context, Kempe et al. \cite{kempe2003maximizing} introduced the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which identifies $k$ most influential nodes (spreader nodes), such that the maximum number of people in the network adopts the promotional message.
  Many variants of the IM problem have been studied in the literature, namely, Perfect Evangelising Set (PES), Perfect Awareness Problem (PAP), etc. In this work, we propose a maximization version of PAP called the \IM{} problem. Different people have different levels of interest in a particular product. This is modeled by assigning an interest value to each node in the network. Then, the problem is to select $k$ initial spreaders such that the sum of the interest values of the people (nodes) who become aware of the message is maximized.
  We study the \IM{} problem under two popular diffusion models: the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) and the Independent Cascade Model (ICM). We show that the \IM{} problem is NP-Hard under LTM. We give linear programming formulation for the problem under LTM. We propose four heuristic algorithms for the \IM{} problem: \LBE{} (\LB{}), Maximum Degree First Heuristic (\MD{}), \PBE{} (\PB{}), and Maximum Profit Based Greedy Heuristic (\MP{}). Extensive experimentation has been carried out on many real-world benchmark data sets for both diffusion models. The results show that among the proposed heuristics, \MP{} performs better in maximizing the interest value.</description>

      <title>BOND: Bootstrapping From-Scratch Name Disambiguation with Multi-task Promoting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From-scratch name disambiguation is an essential task for establishing a reliable foundation for academic platforms. It involves partitioning documents authored by identically named individuals into groups representing distinct real-life experts. Canonically, the process is divided into two decoupled tasks: locally estimating the pairwise similarities between documents followed by globally grouping these documents into appropriate clusters. However, such a decoupled approach often inhibits optimal information exchange between these intertwined tasks. Therefore, we present BOND, which bootstraps the local and global informative signals to promote each other in an end-to-end regime. Specifically, BOND harnesses local pairwise similarities to drive global clustering, subsequently generating pseudo-clustering labels. These global signals further refine local pairwise characterizations. The experimental results establish BOND's superiority, outperforming other advanced baselines by a substantial margin. Moreover, an enhanced version, BOND+, incorporating ensemble and post-match techniques, rivals the top methods in the WhoIsWho competition.</description>

      <title>Toxic Synergy Between Hate Speech and Fake News Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hate speech on social media is a pressing concern. Understanding the factors associated with hate speech may help mitigate it. Here we explore the association between hate speech and exposure to fake news by studying the correlation between exposure to news from low-credibility sources through following connections and the use of hate speech on Twitter. Using news source credibility labels and a dataset of posts with hate speech targeting various populations, we find that hate speakers are exposed to lower percentages of posts linking to credible news sources. When taking the target population into account, we find that this association is mainly driven by anti-semitic and anti-Muslim content. We also observe that hate speakers are more likely to be exposed to low-credibility news with low popularity. Finally, while hate speech is associated with low-credibility news from partisan sources, we find that those sources tend to skew to the political left for antisemitic content and to the political right for hate speech targeting Muslim and Latino populations. Our results suggest that mitigating fake news and hate speech may have synergistic effects.</description>

      <title>Relational Prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social Event Detection (SED) aims to identify significant events from social streams, and has a wide application ranging from public opinion analysis to risk management. In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solutions have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, GNN-based methods often struggle with noisy and missing edges between messages, affecting the quality of learned message embedding. Moreover, these methods statically initialize node embedding before training, which, in turn, limits the ability to learn from message texts and relations simultaneously. In this paper, we approach social event detection from a new perspective based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), and present RPLM_SED (Relational prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection). We first propose a new pairwise message modeling strategy to construct social messages into message pairs with multi-relational sequences. Secondly, a new multi-relational prompt-based pairwise message learning mechanism is proposed to learn more comprehensive message representation from message pairs with multi-relational prompts using PLMs. Thirdly, we design a new clustering constraint to optimize the encoding process by enhancing intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster dispersion, making the message representation more distinguishable. We evaluate the RPLM_SED on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that the RPLM_SED model achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline, online, low-resource, and long-tail distribution scenarios for social event detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient GPU Implementation of Static and Incrementally Expanding DF-P PageRank for Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PageRank is a widely used centrality measure that "ranks" vertices in a graph by considering the connections and their importance. In this report, we first introduce one of the most efficient GPU implementations of Static PageRank, which recomputes PageRank scores from scratch. It uses a synchronous pull-based atomics-free PageRank computation, with the low and high in-degree vertices being partitioned and processed by two separate kernels. Next, we present our GPU implementation of incrementally expanding (and contracting) Dynamic Frontier with Pruning (DF-P) PageRank, which processes only a subset of vertices likely to change ranks. It is based on Static PageRank, and uses an additional partitioning between low and high out-degree vertices for incremental expansion of the set of affected vertices with two additional kernels. On a server with an NVIDIA A100 GPU, our Static PageRank outperforms Hornet and Gunrock's PageRank implementations by 31x and 5.9x respectively. On top of the above, DF-P PageRank outperforms Static PageRank by 2.1x on real-world dynamic graphs, and by 3.1x on large static graphs with random batch updates.</description>

      <title>When Science Locks In, Can AI Help?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past century, the purpose of scientific practices has undergone a profound transformation, from an intellectual pursuit to a problem-solving enterprise, leading to an increasing risk of path dependency in scientific endeavors. Our research, analyzing 41 million research articles from the past six decades, emphasizes the concern of science lock-in by identifying and measuring two types of innovations in science: complementary and substitutive. Over the past six decades, the fraction of complementary innovation has risen to become the majority, while the fraction of substitutive innovation has declined to become the minority, revealing two different mechanisms of innovation: recombination and substitution. Amidst the increasing knowledge burden for innovation, while current AIs may excel in idea recombination due to their strong memory capabilities, their potential to contribute to the substitution mechanism remains uncertain, as they lack the ability to forget.</description>

      <title>Non-robustness of diffusion estimates on networks with measurement error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network diffusion models are used to study things like disease transmission, information spread, and technology adoption. However, small amounts of mismeasurement are extremely likely in the networks constructed to operationalize these models. We show that estimates of diffusions are highly non-robust to this measurement error. First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable. Possible solutions, such as estimating the measurement error or implementing widespread detection efforts, still face difficulties because the number of missed links are so small. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations on simulated networks, and real networks from three settings: travel data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the western US, a mobile phone marketing campaign in rural India, and in an insurance experiment in China.</description>
