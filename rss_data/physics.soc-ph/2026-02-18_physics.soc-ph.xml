      <title>Condensed Past, Thick Present: Evolutionary Approach to the Conscious Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the conceptual convergence between Lee Smolin's Causal Theory of Views, Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, and contemporary psychological accounts of the functions of consciousness. Although formulated within different domains -- physics, biology, and psychology -- all three frameworks, in one form or another, appeal to processes of transition from uncertainty to certainty, in which novelty arises through the resolution of surprise. According to the first two approaches, these transitions are realized within particular temporo-spatial gaps, which themselves evolve and become increasingly elaborate as organization grows. By tracing the structural and functional parallels between these frameworks, the paper proposes an account of how the evolution and the gradual elaboration of novelty, surprise, and these temporo-spatial gaps may be linked to the emergence and progressive development of consciousness, up to its highest forms addressed by psychology.</description>

      <title>The Nexus of Quantum Technology, Intellectual Property, and National Security: An LSI Test for Securing the Quantum Industrial Commons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our world of power and national security is increasingly probabilistic: like a quantum wavefunction, it encodes multiple plausible futures until policy choices and shocks collapse them into observable outcomes. Quantum technologies have moved from laboratory curiosities to strategic infrastructure, with an approaching 'event horizon' reflected in recent United States strategic assessments -- incl. the U.S. --China Economic and Security Review Commission's (USSC) call for a Quantum First posture by 2030- and in parallel White House initiatives aimed at securing critical inputs and accelerating trusted innovation. Government research further documents that China's quantum program is centrally mobilized under military-civil fusion, and that its consequential advantages may arise not only from computing milestones but also from sensing and cryptanalytic applications, thereby sharpening the need for a values based deterrence by denial governance posture. The Article's central claim is that the U.S. and its allies should pursue security-sufficient openness, operationalized through a least-trade-restrictive, security-sufficient, innovation-preserving (LSI) test that disciplines both state and private action. The LSI test integrates emerging instruments of economic statecraft to create secure closed loop enclaves for high-sensitivity collaborative R&amp;D. The Article's contribution is an implementable coalition playbook, offering empirically anchored criteria, templates, and differentiated guardrails -- incl. red zone domains where denial is the default -- to avoid both over-securitization and under-securitization. Properly applied, LSI reduces the risk of a self-defeating Silicon Curtain while establishing standards-first interoperability as a stabilizing eigenstate of the international order and enabling RQT by design to shape trusted adoption pathways beyond the coalition, incl. in the majority world.</description>

      <title>One Rule to Bring Them All: Investigating Transport Connectivity in Public Transport Route Generation for Equitable Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a city-wide public transport network poses a dual challenge: achieving computational efficiency while ensuring spatial equity for different population groups. We investigate whether AI-based optimization hybrid neuroevolutionary methods combining graph neural networks with evolutionary algorithms - can scale Transit Network Design Problem (TNDP) solutions from synthetic tests to real urban networks while preserving social fairness. Our contribution is to introduce a transport connectivity-aware accessibility metric that bases optimization on principles of equitable accessibility rather than traditional trade-offs between passenger and operator costs. The results show a noticeable improvement in network resilience by improving algebraic connectivity on synthetic datasets, and highlight the ambiguity of applying network generation to real data.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Game Theory Model for Sustainable UN Financing: Addressing Global Public Goods Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel cooperative game theory model designed to improve the United Nations' current funding mechanisms, which predominantly rely on voluntary contributions. By shifting from a Nash equilibrium framework, where member states act in self-interest, to a cooperative model, the proposed approach aligns each country's financial contributions with the benefits they derive from UN activities. The model ensures a more sustainable and equitable system by introducing personalized pricing based on derived utility. Using agent-based simulations, the research demonstrates that the suggested approach increases global utility, reduces free-rider issues, and creates a more efficient resource allocation system. The findings suggest that the proposed model can optimize UN funding, ensuring a more stable and effective framework for global public goods provision, while considering the varying economic capacities of member states. Further research is recommended to assess the political viability of the model.</description>

      <title>Structural Divergence Between AI-Agent and Human Social Networks in Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large populations of AI agents are increasingly embedded in online environments, yet little is known about how their collective interaction patterns compare to human social systems. Here, we analyze the full interaction network of Moltbook, a platform where AI agents and humans coexist, and systematically compare its structure to well-characterized human communication networks. Although Moltbook follows the same node-edge scaling relationship observed in human systems, indicating comparable global growth constraints, its internal organization diverges markedly. The network exhibits extreme attention inequality, heavy-tailed and asymmetric degree distributions, suppressed reciprocity, and a global under-representation of connected triadic structures. Community analysis reveals a structured modular architecture with elevated modularity and comparatively lower community size inequality relative to degree-preserving null models. Together, these findings show that AI-agent societies can reproduce global structural regularities of human networks while exhibiting fundamentally different internal organizing principles, highlighting that key features of human social organization are not universal but depend on the nature of the interacting agents.</description>

      <title>Social Contagion and Bank Runs: An Agent-Based Model with LLM Depositors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital banking and online communication have made modern bank runs faster and more networked than the canonical queue-at-the-branch setting. While equilibrium models explain why strategic complementarities generate run risk, they offer limited guidance on how beliefs synchronize and propagate in real time. We develop a process-based agent-based model that makes the information and coordination layer explicit. Banks follow cash-first withdrawal processing with discounted fire-sale liquidation and an endogenous stress index. Depositors are heterogeneous in risk tolerance and in the weight placed on fundamentals versus social information, communicating on a heavy-tailed network calibrated to Twitter activity during March 2023. Depositor behavior is generated by a constrained large language model that maps each agent's information set into a discrete action and an optional post; we validate this policy against laboratory coordination evidence and theoretical benchmarks. Across 4,900 configurations and full LLM simulations, three findings emerge. Within-bank connectivity raises the likelihood and speed of withdrawal cascades holding fundamentals fixed. Cross-bank contagion exhibits a sharp phase transition near spillover rates of 0.10. Depositor overlap and network amplification interact nonlinearly, so channels weak in isolation become powerful in combination. In an SVB, First Republic, and regional bank scenario disciplined by crisis-era data, the model reproduces the observed ordering of failures and predicts substantially higher withdrawal rates among uninsured depositors. The results frame social correlation as a measurable amplifier of run risk alongside balance-sheet fundamentals.</description>

      <title>Travel Time Prediction from Sparse Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Travel time prediction is central to transport geography and planning's accessibility analyses, sustainable transportation infrastructure provision, and active transportation interventions. However, calculating accurate travel times, especially for driving, requires either extensive technical capacity and bespoke data, or resources like the Google Maps API that quickly become prohibitively expensive to analyze thousands or millions of trips necessary for metropolitan-scale analyses. Such obstacles particularly challenge less-resourced researchers, practitioners, and community advocates. This article argues that a middle-ground is needed to provide reasonably accurate travel time predictions without extensive data or computing requirements. It introduces a free, open-source minimally-congested driving time prediction model with minimal cost, data, and computational requirements. It trains and tests this model using the Los Angeles, California urban area as a case study by calculating naive travel times from open data then developing a random forest model to predict travel times as a function of those naive times plus open data on turns and traffic controls. Validation shows that this interpretable machine learning method offers a superior middle-ground technique that balances reasonable accuracy with minimal resource requirements.</description>

      <title>Environment-Driven Emergence of Higher-Order Collective Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behavior is commonly attributed to direct interactions among system components. Using a minimal stochastic model, we show that higher-order collective structure can instead emerge from shared stochastic environments, even in the absence of interactions. Quantified via the O-information, environmental fluctuations induce both redundant and synergistic dependencies, with the latter occupying larger regions of the correlation space. We establish a no-go theorem showing that time-independent coupling between the system variables and a shared stochastic environment rules out synergistic higher-order behavior. Crucially, this constraint can be overcome dynamically: transitions between redundancy and synergy arise from time-dependent environmental coupling or from the nontrivial interplay between shared environments and direct interactions. Together, these results identify environmental mediation as a distinct mechanism of higher-order collective organization beyond the conventional interaction-centric paradigm.</description>

      <title>The Skeletal Trap: Mapping Spatial Inequality and Ghost Stops in Ankara's Transit Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ankara's public transport crisis is commonly framed as a shortage of buses or operational inefficiency. This study argues that the problem is fundamentally morphological and structural. The city's leapfrog urban expansion has produced fragmented peripheral clusters disconnected from a rigid, center-oriented bus network. As a result, demand remains intensely concentrated along the Kizilay-Ulus axis and western corridors, while peripheral districts experience either chronic under-service or enforced transfer dependency. The deficiency is therefore not merely quantitative but rooted in the misalignment between urban macroform and network architecture. The empirical analysis draws on a 173-day operational dataset derived from route-level passenger and trip reports published by EGO under the former "Transparent Ankara" initiative. To overcome the absence of stop-level geospatial data, a Connectivity-Based Weighted Distribution Model reallocates passenger volumes to 1 km x 1 km grid cells using network centrality. The findings reveal persistent center-periphery asymmetries, structural bottlenecks, and spatially embedded accessibility inequalities.</description>

      <title>Household size can explain 40% of the variance in cumulative COVID-19 incidence across Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Household size impacts the spread of respiratory infectious diseases: Larger households tend to boost transmission by acquiring external infections more frequently and subsequently transmitting them back into the community. Furthermore, mandatory interventions primarily modulate contagion between households rather than within them. We developed an approach to quantify the role of household size in epidemics by separating within-household from out-household transmission, and found that household size explains 41% of the variability in cumulative COVID-19 incidence across 34 European countries (95% confidence interval: [15%, 46%]). The contribution of households to the overall dynamics can be quantified by a boost factor that increases with the effective household size, implying that countries with larger households require more stringent interventions to achieve the same levels of containment. This suggests that households constitute a structural (dis-)advantage that must be considered when designing and evaluating mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>How to Detect Information Voids Using Longitudinal Data from Social Media and Web Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of the attention economy, where content producers compete for the attention of users, relies on two key forces: information supply and demand. This study leverages the feedback loop between these forces to develop a method for detecting and quantifying information voids, i.e., periods in which little or no reliable information is available on a given topic. Using a case study on COVID-19 vaccines rollout in six European countries, and drawing on data from multiple platforms including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Wikipedia, and online news outlets, we examine how information voids emerge, persist and correlate with a decline in the proportion of high-quality information circulating online. By conceptualising information voids as a specific regime of information spreading, we also quantify their counterpart, information overabundance, which constitute a central component of the current definition of infodemic. We show that information voids are associated with a higher prevalence of misinformation, thus representing problematic hotspots in which individuals are more likely to be misled by low-quality online content. Overall, our findings provide empirical support for the inclusion of information voids in mechanistic explanations of misinformation emergence.</description>

      <title>SVD Incidence Centrality: A Unified Spectral Framework for Node and Edge Analysis in Directed Networks and Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes and edges in directed networks remains a fundamental challenge across domains from social influence to biological regulation. Most existing centrality measures face a critical limitation: they either discard directional information through symmetrization or produce sparse, implementation-dependent rankings that obscure structural importance. We introduce a unified spectral framework for centrality analysis in directed networks grounded in the Singular value decomposition of the incidence matrix. The proposed approach derives both vertex and edge centralities via the pseudoinverse of Hodge Laplacians, yielding dense and well-resolved rankings that overcome the sparsity limitations commonly observed in betweenness centrality for directed graphs. Unlike traditional measures that require graph symmetrization, our framework naturally preserves directional information, enabling principled hub/authority analysis while maintaining mathematical consistency through spectral graph theory. The method extends naturally to hypergraphs through the same mathematical foundation. Experimental validation on real-world networks demonstrates the framework's effectiveness across diverse domains where traditional centrality measures encounter limitations due to implementation dependencies and sparse outputs.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Weighted Communicability Curvature as a Structural Driver of Dengue Spread: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis of Recife (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\phi \approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>

Abstract: To model dense crowds, the usual recourse to oversimplified (circular) pedestrian shapes and contact forces shows limitations. To help modellers overcome these limitations, we propose an open-source numerical tool. It consists of a Python library that generates 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds based on anthropometric data, and a C++ library that computes mechanical contacts with other agents and with obstacles, and evolves the crowd's configuration. Additionally, we provide an online platform with a user-friendly graphical interface for the Python library, and scripts to call the C++ library from Python. The tool enables users to implement their own decisional layer, i.e., to control the agents' choices of desired velocities.</description>
