      <title>Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA): The Properties of Quasar Host Galaxies: Star Formation Histories and Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the star formation history and stellar populations of a sample of 205 Type I quasar host galaxies (0.1$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.35) and compared with normal (non-active) galaxies of the same mass and redshift within the volume of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) redshift survey. We find that quasar host galaxies tend to be star-forming galaxies ($\sim$ 80%) lying on the star-forming MS; the fraction of quasar host galaxies that are quiescent ($\sim$ 20%) is lower than the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the comparison sample of normal galaxies (54%). We find that the mean star formation rate of quasar host galaxies has increased over the past 100 Myr by a factor of 2--3, but these galaxies were star-forming at all times previously. Our data are more consistent with quasar activity originating together with an increase in the star formation rate of otherwise normal galaxies, similar to episodic star formation in normal spirals. We argue that this indicates that secular processes and minor mergers may be the favored triggers of nuclear activity in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>A reconciliation of the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina statistics for semi-classical simulations of annihilation photons correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two photons from the ground state para-positronium annihilation are emitted in a maximally entangled singlet state of orthogonal polarizations. In case of the Compton scattering of both photons the phenomenon of quantum entanglement leads to a measurable increase in the azimuthal correlations of scattered photons, as opposed to a classical description treating the two scattering events as independent. The probability of the scattering of the system of the entangled photons is described by the Pryce-Ward cross section dependent on a difference of the azimuthal scattering angles in the fixed coordinate frame, while the independent scattering of single photons is described by the Klein-Nishina cross section dependent on the azimuthal angle relative to each photon's initial polarization. Since the singlet state of orthogonal polarizations is rotationally invariant, it does not carry any physical information on the initial polarizations of the single annihilation photons. In such bipartite state the angular origin for the Klein-Nishina cross section is undefined, making the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina descriptions mutually exclusive. However, semi-classical simulations of the joint Compton scattering of entangled photons - implementing the Pryce-Ward cross section, but still treating the two photons as separate entities - can reconcile the Pryce-Ward correlations with the Klein-Nishina statistics for single photons by implementing a modified version of a scattering cross section presented in this work.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of Higgs Hadronic Decay Modes at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expected precision at the FCC-ee on the product $\sigma\times\mathcal{B}(H\rightarrow b\bar{b}, c\bar{c},s\bar{s},gg)$ of Higgs boson production cross sections times branching ratios of hadronic decays is presented. This study provides the first comprehensive determination of all major hadronic Higgs decay modes in a combined fit at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders, using both Higgs-strahlung ($ZH$) and Vector boson fusion ($\nu\bar{\nu} H$) production processes, with a full treatment of interference effects in the $\nu\bar{\nu} jj$ final state. It assumes four identical IDEA detectors collecting $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=240$ and $365\,$GeV. The combination of all channels across both energies, with full covariance between production and decay modes, yields a production cross-section times branching-ratio precision at the percent to per-mil level for the dominant hadronic final states ($b\bar{b}, c\bar{c},gg$). These results provide a comprehensive input to the determination of Higgs coupling projections at the FCC-ee, and they establish for the first time sensitivity to the rare decay $H\rightarrow s\bar{s}$, demonstrating that FCC-ee has the potential to provide evidence of the strange-quark Yukawa coupling.</description>

      <title>SlotFlow: Amortized Trans-Dimensional Inference with Slot-Based Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the number of distinct components contributing to an observation, while simultaneously estimating their parameters, remains a long-standing challenge across signal processing, astrophysics, and neuroscience. Classical trans-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) provide asymptotically exact inference but can be computationally expensive. Instead, modern deep learning provides a faster alternative to inference but typically assume fixed component counts, sidestepping the core challenge of trans-dimensionality. To address this, we introduce SlotFlow, a deep learning architecture for trans-dimensional amortized inference. The architecture processes time-series observations, which we represent jointly in the frequency and time domains through parallel encoders. A classifier produces a distribution over component counts K, and its MAP estimate specifies the number of slots instantiated. Each slot is parameterized by a shared conditional normalizing flow trained via permutation-invariant Hungarian matching. On sinusoidal decomposition with up to 10 overlapping components and Gaussian noise, SlotFlow achieves 99.85% cardinality accuracy and well-calibrated parameter posteriors, with systematic biases well below one posterior standard deviation. Direct comparison with RJMCMC shows close agreement in amplitude and phase, with Wasserstein distances $W_2 &lt; 0.01$ and $&lt; 0.03$, indicating that shared global context captures inter-component structure despite a factorized posterior. Frequency posteriors remain centered but exhibit 2-3x broader intervals, consistent with an encoder bottleneck in retaining long-baseline phase coherence. The method delivers a $\sim 10^6\times$ speedup over RJMCMC, suggesting applicability to time-critical workflows in gravitational-wave astronomy, neural spike sorting, and object-centric vision.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimization in high dimensional space by deep kernel learning augmented genetic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration of complex high-dimensional spaces presents significant challenges in fields such as molecular discovery, process optimization, and supply chain management. Genetic Algorithms (GAs), while offering significant power for creating new candidate spaces, often entail high computational demands due to the need for evaluation of each new proposed solution. On the other hand, Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) efficiently navigates the spaces of preselected candidate structures but lacks generative capabilities. This study introduces an approach that amalgamates the generative power of GAs to create new candidates with the efficiency of DKL-based surrogate models to rapidly ascertain the behavior of new candidate spaces. This DKL-GA framework can be further used to build Bayesian Optimization (BO) workflows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through the optimization of the FerroSIM model, showcasing its broad applicability to diverse challenges, including molecular discovery and battery charging optimization.</description>

      <title>Development of systematic uncertainty-aware neural network trainings for binned-likelihood analyses at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network training method capable of accounting for the effects of systematic variations of the data model in the training process and describe its extension towards neural network multiclass classification. The procedure is evaluated on the realistic case of the measurement of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion in the $\tau\tau$ decay channel at the CMS experiment. The neural network output functions are used to infer the signal strengths for inclusive production of Higgs bosons as well as for their production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion. We observe improvements of 12 and 16% in the uncertainty in the signal strengths for gluon and vector-boson fusion, respectively, compared with a conventional neural network training based on cross-entropy.</description>
