      <title>Validation of NSFsim as a Grad-Shafranov Equilibrium Solver at DIII-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma shape is a significant factor that must be considered for any Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) as it has significant consequences for plasma stability and core confinement. A new simulator, NSFsim, has been developed based on a historically successful code, DINA, offering tools to simulate both transport and plasma shape. Specifically, NSFsim is a free boundary equilibrium and transport solver and has been configured to match the properties of the DIII-D tokamak. This paper is focused on validating the Grad-Shafranov (GS) solver of NSFsim by analyzing its ability to recreate the plasma shape, the poloidal flux distribution, and the measurements of the simulated diagnostic signals originating from flux loops and magnetic probes in DIII-D. Five different plasma shapes are simulated to show the robustness of NSFsim to different plasma conditions; these shapes are Lower Single Null (LSN), Upper Single Null (USN), Double Null (DN), Inner Wall Limited (IWL), and Negative Triangularity (NT). The NSFsim results are compared against real measured signals, magnetic profile fits from EFIT, and another plasma equilibrium simulator, GSevolve. EFIT reconstructions of shots are readily available at DIII-D, but GSevolve was manually ran by us to provide simulation data to compare against.</description>

      <title>Streamer discharge simulations in humid air: uncertainty in input data and sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the choice of input data affects simulations of positive streamers in humid air, focusing on H2O cross sections, photoionization models, and chemistry sets. Simulations are performed in air with a mole fraction of 0%, 3% or 10% H2O using an axisymmetric fluid model. Five H2O cross section sets are considered, which lead to significant differences in the resulting electron attachment coefficient. As a result, the streamer velocity can vary by up to about 50% with 10% H2O. We compare results with three photoionization models: the Naidis model for humid air, the Aints model for humid air, and the standard Zheleznyak model for dry air. With the Naidis and in particular the Aints model, there is a significant reduction in photoionization with higher humidities. This results in higher streamer velocities and maximal electric fields, and it can also cause streamer branching in our axisymmetric simulations. Three humid air chemistry sets are considered. Differences between these sets, particularly in the formation of water clusters around positive ions, cause the streamer velocity to vary by up to about 50% with 10% H2O. A sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most important chemical reactions in these chemistries.</description>

      <title>Near-ideal relaxed MHD in slab geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the solutions of the relaxed MHD model (RxMHD) of Dewar \&amp; Qu [J. Plasma Phys. {\bf 88}, 835880101 (2022)]. This model is a generalization of Taylor relaxation that allows the ideal Ohm's law constraint to be included, and this offers a pathway to extend the multi-region relaxed MHD (MRxMHD) model. By constructing solutions numerically, we show that the RxMHD model of Dewar \&amp; Qu is mathematically well-defined and computationally feasible for constructing MHD equilibria. We also show that a cross-field flow can exist without enforcing an arbitrary constraint on the angular momentum (as is done in the case of MRxMHD with flow), and a pressure profile with a small gradient due to the Bernoulli flow. Our results also demonstrate the self-organization of fully relaxed regions during the optimization, which was an important motivation behind developing this model.</description>

      <title>On unipolar and bipolar HiPIMS pulse configurations to enhance energy flux to insulating surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) delivers a high target power in short pulses, enhancing the ionization and energy of sputtered atoms and providing thus more possibilities to control the film properties. This study explores the effect of various pulse configurations (unipolar HiPIMS, bipolar HiPIMS, chopped unipolar, and chopped bipolar HiPIMS) to increase energy flux to an insulated surface (e.g., substrate or growing film). The chopped bipolar HiPIMS configuration, featuring several short positive pulses replacing a single long positive pulse, is introduced, and the total energy fluxes are subsequently measured using a passive thermal probe. Moreover, the effect of the probe's capacitance with respect to the ground is systematically investigated by connecting an external capacitor. Results show that for an insulated surface with low capacitance, bipolar pulse configurations do not significantly increase energy flux to the surface due to its rapid charging by plasma ions. Conversely, high surface capacitance facilitates an increase in energy flux, as a large potential difference between the plasma and the surface remains even for a long positive pulse. For medium surface capacitance (tens of nF), chopping the positive pulse in bipolar HiPIMS effectively increases the energy delivered to the film by discharging the surface in the off-times. The thermal probe measurements also confirm that energy to the film can be increased for unipolar HiPIMS configurations by splitting the negative pulse into several shorter pulses.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic magnetization of primordial plasma by virial shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy-cluster virial (structure-formation accretion) shock observations are shown to imply $\gtrsim1\%$ magnetization of a layer extending $\gtrsim10^{16}$ Debye lengths downstream, challenging the modelling of high Alfv\'en-Mach collisionless shocks. Unlike similar shocks in supernova remnants or relativistic shocks in $\gamma$-ray burst afterglows, where macroscopic magnetized layers were detected but purportedly attributed to preexisting or non-resonant cosmic-ray streaming-seeded substructure, the upstream of strong virial shocks is both weakly magnetized and pristine. Hence, some mechanism must generate large-scale and possibly self-similar magnetic sub-structure out of the accreted primordial plasma; such a mechanism may dominate other high-Mach shock systems, too.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model of Cosmic Ray Propagation and Radio Extreme Scattering Events from Intermittent Interstellar Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittent magnetic structures are a plausible candidate for explaining cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion rates derived from observed CR energy spectra. Independently, studies of extreme scattering events (ESEs) of radio quasars and pulsar scintillation have hinted that very straight, large-aspect-ratio, magnetic current sheets may be responsible for the localized large scattering of radio waves. The required shortest axis of the typical structures producing ESEs is of the same scale ($\sim$AU) as the gyroradii of $\sim$GeV CRs. In this paper, we propose that the same magnetic/density sheets can produce large scattering of both CRs and radio waves. We demonstrate that the geometry and volume filling factor of the sheets derived from quasar ESEs can explain the observed mean free path of GeV CRs without introducing free parameters. The model places constraints on the sheet geometry, such as straightness and large aspect ratio, and assumes the statistics of the sheets are similar throughout the Galactic volume. We, therefore, discuss observational tests of the sheet model, which includes observations of echoes in pulsars and fast radio bursts, gravitationally lensed quasars, the distribution of ESE durations, and spatial correlations between ESE events and rotation-measure fluctuations. Such tests will be enabled by upcoming wide-field radio instruments, including Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and Deep Synoptic Array 2000 Antennas (DSA-2000).</description>

      <title>Macroscopic arrow of time from multiscale perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal ($T$) symmetry, but the $T$ symmetry is strongly broken in the macroscopic world. In this Perspective, I review $T$ symmetry breaking frameworks: \textit{second law of thermodynamics, multiscale energy transfer}, and \textit{open systems}. In driven dissipative nonequilibrium systems, including turbulence, the multiscale energy flux from large scales to small scales helps determine the arrow of time. In addition, open systems are often irreversible due to particle and energy exchanges between the system and the environment. Causality is another important factor that breaks the $T$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>New Methods for Computer Tomography Based Ion Thruster Diagnostics and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-destructive X-ray imaging of thruster parts and assemblies down to the scale of several micrometers is a key technology for electric propulsion research and engineering. It allows for thorough product assurance, rapid state acquisition and implementation of more detailed simulation models to understand the physics of device wear and erosion.
  Being able to inspect parts as 3D density maps allows insight into inner structures hidden from observation. Generating these density maps and also constructing three dimensional mesh objects for further processing depends on the achievable quality of the reconstruction, which is the inverse of Radon's transformation connecting a stack of projections taken from different angles to the original object's structure. Reconstruction is currently flawed by strong mathematical artifacts induced by the many aligned parts and stark density contrasts commonly found in electric propulsion thrusters.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of three-dimensional Yukawa or dust crystals from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I calculate the elastic properties of three-dimensional Yukawa or dust crystals using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The elastic properties are computed by deforming (compressing/expanding) the dust crystals along different directions. The stress and strain of the deformed crystal are used to calculate elastic properties. The bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio are determined as a function of shielding parameter $\kappa$ and strong coupling parameter $\Gamma$. The bulk and shear modulus values at 0 K temperature are well consistent with the previous literature results, while results with finite temperatures are new. It is found that the values of shear modulus depend on the initial distribution of particles in the MD simulations, namely random, BCC, and FCC. Additionally, the characteristic curve of the shear modulus as a function of the strong coupling parameter is non-monotonic, reaching a minimum value near the solid-liquid boundary of the Yukawa system.</description>

      <title>Stability of Crossed-Field Amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research examines the stability of crossed-field amplifiers (CFAs) and characterizes their different modes of operation: amplification, driven oscillation, and self-excited oscillation. The CFA used in this paper is the Recirculating Planar Crossed-Field Amplifier (RPCFA), which is a high power (MW) pulsed (300 ns) amplifier that operates around 3 GHz. Initially, the RPCFA is shown to be a stable amplifier with moderate gain (5.1 dB), but by either reducing the anode-cathode (AK) gap spacing or increasing the driving current, the amplifier operation transitions from amplification to oscillation. Depending on the operating conditions, these oscillations are either driven by the input RF signal or self-excited. These self-excited oscillations can have a lower synchronization phase velocity than the maximum velocity in the electron beam, implying that slower electrons within the Brillouin hub can interact with electromagnetic modes on the RF circuit. A cold tube analysis of the RPCFA shows that the Q-factor of certain modes on the RF circuit varies significantly when the AK gap geometry of the RPCFA is altered which leads to a discrete shift in operating frequency. The operation of the RPCFA close to Hull cutoff is found to share some key features of magnetically insulated transmission line oscillators (MILO) that could also explain the dramatic frequency shift. Instantaneous phase analysis by Hilbert transforms can be used, in conjunction with the frequency and output power analysis, to determine the onset of the transition from amplification to oscillation, and to characterize the oscillation.</description>

      <title>Contrasting thermodynamic and hydrodynamic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using \textit{hydrodynamic entropy} we quantify the multiscale disorder in Euler and hydrodynamic turbulence. These examples illustrate that the hydrodynamic entropy is not extensive because it is not proportional to the system size. Consequently, we cannot add hydrodynamic and thermodynamic entropies, which measure disorder at macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. In this paper, we also discuss the hydrodynamic entropy for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and Ising spins.</description>
