      <title>Insurance products with guarantees in an affine setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make medium- and long-term insurance products attractive, it is essential to enable participation in stock market returns. However, to eliminate downside risk, guarantees must be included, which naturally leads to the challenge of valuing such contracts within a unified insurance-finance framework. We develop a general setup that allows for the joint modelling of financial markets, mortality and policyholder behaviour. Within this framework, we propose a general affine approach and derive explicit valuation formulas for variable annuities and related contracts, while retaining computational tractability due to the affine structure. The model permits flexible dependence between mortality and equity dynamics, as supported by empirical evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, surrender intensities are modelled as functions of the underlying affine process, thereby introducing market dependence into lapse behaviour. The resulting framework combines analytical tractability with sufficient flexibility to capture key features of long-term insurance products.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Self- and Cross-Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an offline nonparametric estimator for concave multi-asset propagator models based on a dataset of correlated price trajectories and metaorders. Compared to parametric models, our framework avoids parameter explosion in the multi-asset case and yields confidence bounds for the estimator. We implement the estimator using both proprietary metaorder data from Capital Fund Management (CFM) and publicly available S&amp;P order flow data, where we augment the former dataset using a metaorder proxy. In particular, we provide unbiased evidence that self-impact is concave and exhibits a shifted power-law decay, and show that the metaorder proxy stabilizes the calibration. Moreover, we find that introducing cross-impact provides a significant gain in explanatory power, with concave specifications outperforming linear ones, suggesting that the square-root law extends to cross-impact. We also measure asymmetric cross-impact between assets driven by relative liquidity differences. Finally, we demonstrate that a shape-constrained projection of the nonparametric kernel not only ensures interpretability but also slightly outperforms established parametric models in terms of predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Path-dependent Kyle equilibrium model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.06395v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an auction type equilibrium model with an insider in line with the one originally introduced by Kyle in 1985 and then extended to the continuous time setting by Back in 1992. The novelty introduced with this paper is that we deal with a general price functional depending on the whole past of the aggregate demand, i.e. we work with path-dependency. By using the functional It\^o calculus, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an equilibrium. Furthermore, we consider both the cases of a risk-neutral and a risk-averse insider.</description>

      <title>Default Resilience and Worst-Case Effects in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the resilience of a network of banks to joint price fluctuations of the external assets in which they have shared exposures, and evaluate the worst-case effects of the possible default contagion. Indeed, when the prices of certain external assets either decrease or increase, all banks exposed to them experience varying degrees of simultaneous shocks to their balance sheets. These coordinated and structured shocks have the potential to exacerbate the likelihood of defaults. In this context, we introduce first a concept of {default resilience margin}, $\epsilon^*$, i.e., the maximum amplitude of asset prices fluctuations that the network can tolerate without generating defaults. Such threshold value is computed by considering two different measures of price fluctuations, one based on the maximum individual variation of each asset, and the other based on the sum of all the asset's absolute variations. For any price perturbation having amplitude no larger than $\epsilon^*$, the network absorbs the shocks remaining default free. When the perturbation amplitude goes beyond $\epsilon^*$, however, defaults may occur. In this case we find the worst-case systemic loss, that is, the total unpaid debt under the most severe price variation of given magnitude. Computation of both the threshold level $\epsilon^*$ and of the worst-case loss and of a corresponding worst-case asset price scenario, amounts to solving suitable linear programming problems.}</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Factor-Augmented Models for Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasts are vital in modern finance for risk management, portfolio allocation, and strategic decision-making. However, existing methods face key limitations. Fully multivariate models, while comprehensive, are computationally infeasible for realistic portfolios. Factor models, though efficient, primarily use static factor loadings, failing to capture evolving volatility co-movements when they are most critical. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, model-agnostic Factor-Augmented Volatility Forecast framework. Our approach employs a time-varying factor model to extract a compact set of dynamic, cross-sectional factors from realized volatilities with minimal computational cost. These factors are then integrated into both statistical and AI-based forecasting models, enabling a unified system that jointly models asset-specific dynamics and evolving market-wide co-movements. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across two prominent asset classes-large-cap U.S. technology equities and major cryptocurrencies-over both short-term (1-day) and medium-term (7-day) horizons. Using a suite of linear and non-linear AI-driven models, we consistently observe substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and economic value. Notably, a practical pairs-trading strategy built on our forecasts delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and profitability, particularly under adverse market conditions.</description>
