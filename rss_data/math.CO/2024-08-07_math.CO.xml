      <title>Random Tur\'an Problems for Hypergraph Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ is the maximum number of edges in an $F$-free subgraph of the random $r$-uniform hypergraph $G_{n,p}^r$. We prove general results which (informally) shows that if $F$ is an $r_0$-graph, then upper bounds for $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^{r_0},F)$ can be lifted into upper bounds for $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^{r},F^{(r)})$ where $F^{(r)}$ is the $r$-uniform expansion of $F$, i.e.\ the hypergraph obtained from $F$ by inserting $r-r_0$ distinct vertices into each edge of $F$. These results unify and generalize most known upper bounds for random Tur\'an numbers of degenerate hypergraphs of uniformity at least 3, and also provide new tight bounds for the random Tur\'an numbers of expansions of theta graphs and complete bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of phylogenetic systems and electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a graphical map, a new correspondence between circular electrical networks and circular planar split systems. When restricted to the planar circular electrical case, this graphical map finds the split system associated uniquely to the Kalmanson resistance distance of the dual network, matching the induced split system familiar from phylogenetics. This is extended to compactifications of the respective spaces, taking cactus networks to the newly defined compactified split systems. The graphical map preserves both components and cactus structure, allowing an elegant enumeration of induced phylogenetic split systems.</description>

      <title>Sidorenko's conjecture for subdivisions and theta substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Sidorenko's conjecture asserts that for every bipartite graph $H$, the number of homomorphisms from $H$ to a graph $G$ with given edge density is minimized when $G$ is pseudorandom. We prove that for any graph $H$, a graph obtained from replacing edges of $H$ by generalized theta graphs consisting of even paths satisfies Sidorenko's conjecture, provided a certain divisibility condition on the number of paths. To achieve this, we prove unconditionally that bipartite graphs obtained from replacing each edge of a complete graph with a generalized theta graph satisfy Sidorenko's conjecture, which extends a result of Conlon, Kim, Lee and Lee [J. Lond. Math. Soc., 2018].</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Low-rank Tensor Recovery from Uniformly Random Entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a generic tensor $T\in \mathbb{F}^{n\times n\times \dots\times n}$ of order $k$ and CP rank $d$ can be uniquely recovered from $n\log n+dn\log \log n +o(n\log \log n) $ uniformly random entries with high probability if $d$ and $k$ are constant and $\mathbb{F}\in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$. The bound is tight up to the coefficient of the second leading term and improves on the existing $O(n^{\frac{k}{2}}{\rm polylog}(n))$ upper bound for order $k$ tensors. The bound is obtained by showing that the projection of the Segre variety to a random axis-parallel linear subspace preserves $d$-identifiability with high probability if the dimension of the subspace is $n\log n+dn\log \log n +o(n\log \log n) $ and $n$ is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Deformed Intersections of Half-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the classification problems concerning extended deformations of convex polyhedra and real hyperplane arrangements in the following senses: combinatorial equivalence of face posets, normal equivalence on normal fans of convex polyhedra, and sign equivalence on half-spaces. The extended deformations of convex polyhedra arise from parallel translations of given half-spaces and hyperplanes, whose normal vectors give rise to the so-called ``derived arrangement'' proposed by Rota as well as Crapo in different forms. We show that two extended deformations of convex polyhedra are normally (combinatorially, as a consequence) equivalent if they are parameterized by the same open face of the derived arrangement. Note that these extended deformations are based on parallel translations of the given hyperplanes. It allows us to study three deformations of real hyperplane arrangements: parallel translations, conings, and elementary lifts, whose configuration spaces are parameterized by open faces of the derived arrangement. Consequently, it gives a characterization of the normal, combinatorial, and sign equivalences of those three deformations via the derived arrangement. Additionally, the relationships among these three equivalence relations are discussed, and several new descriptions of real derived arrangements associated with faces and sign vectors of real hyperplane arrangements are provided.</description>

      <title>More results on the spectral radius of graphs with no odd wheels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, the spectral radius $\lambda_{1}(G)$ of $G$ is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. An odd wheel $W_{2k+1}$ with $k\geq2$ is a graph obtained from a cycle of order $2k$ by adding a new vertex connecting to all the vertices of the cycle. Let ${\rm SPEX}(n,W_{2k+1})$ be the set of $W_{2k+1}$-free graphs of order $n$ with the maximum spectral radius. Very recently, Cioab\u{a}, Desai and Tait \cite{CDT2} characterized the graphs in ${\rm SPEX}(n,W_{2k+1})$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $k\geq2$ and $k\neq4,5$. And they left the case $k=4,5$ as a problem. In this paper, we settle this problem. Moreover, we completely characterize the graphs in ${\rm SPEX}(n,W_{2k+1})$ when $k\geq4$ is even and $n\equiv2~(\mod4)$ is sufficiently large. Consequently, the graphs in ${\rm SPEX}(n,W_{2k+1})$ are characterized completely for any $k\geq2$ and sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Cooperative colorings of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a class $\mathcal{H}$ of $m$ hypergraphs ${H}_1, {H}_2, \ldots, {H}_m$ with the same vertex set $V$, a cooperative coloring of them is a partition $\{I_1, I_2, \ldots, I_m\}$ of $V$ in such a way that each $I_i$ is an independent set in ${H}_i$ for $1\leq i\leq m$. The cooperative chromatic number of a class $\mathcal{H}$ is the smallest number of hypergraphs from $\mathcal{H}$ that always possess a cooperative coloring. For the classes of $k$-uniform tight cycles, $k$-uniform loose cycles, $k$-uniform tight paths, and $k$-uniform loose paths, we find that their cooperative chromatic numbers are all exactly two utilizing a new proved set system partition theorem, which also has its independent interests and offers a broader perspective. For the class of $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraphs with sufficient large maximum degree $d$, we prove that its cooperative chromatic number has lower bound $\Omega(\log_k d)$ and upper bound $\text{O}\left(\frac{d}{\ln d}\right)^{\frac{1}{k-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal and oriented Fano planes, triangular embeddings of $K_7,$ and geometrical representations of the Frobenius group $F_{21}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present some geometrical representations of the Frobenius group of order $21$ (henceforth, $F_{21}$). The main focus is on investigating the group of common automorphisms of two orthogonal Fano planes and the automorphism group of a suitably oriented Fano plane. We show that both groups are isomorphic to $F_{21},$ independently of the choice of the two orthogonal Fano planes and of the choice of the orientation.
  We show, moreover, that any triangular embedding of the complete graph $K_7$ into a surface is isomorphic to the classical toroidal biembedding and hence is face $2$-colorable, with the two color classes defining a pair of orthogonal Fano planes. As a consequence, we show that, for any triangular embedding of $K_7$ into a surface, the group of the automorphisms that preserve the color classes is the Frobenius group of order $21.$
  This way we provide three geometrical representations of $F_{21}$. Also, we apply the representation in terms of two orthogonal Fano planes to give an alternative proof that $F_{21}$ is the automorphism group of the Kirkman triple system of order $15$ that is usually denoted as #61.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KKM theorem, due to Knaster, Kuratowski, and Mazurkiewicz in 1929, is a fundamental result in fixed-point theory, which has seen numerous extensions and applications. In this paper we survey old and recent generalizations of the KKM theorem and their applications in the areas of piercing numbers, mass partition, fair division, and matching theory. We also give a few new results utilizing KKM-type theorems, and discuss related open problems.</description>

      <title>Local permutation polynomials and their companions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gutierrez and Urroz (2023) have proposed a family of local permutation polynomials over finite fields of arbitrary characteristic based on a class of symmetric subgroups without fixed points called $e$-Klenian groups. The polynomials within this family are referred to as $e$-Klenian polynomials. Furthermore, they have shown the existence of companions for the $e$-Klenian polynomials when the characteristic of the finite field is odd. Here, we present three new families of local permutation polynomials over finite fields of even characteristic. We also consider the problem of the existence of companions for the $e$-Klenian polynomials over finite fields of even characteristic. More precisely, we prove that over finite fields of even characteristic, the $0$-Klenian polynomials do not have any companions. However, for $e \geq 1$, we explicitly provide a companion for the $e$-Klenian polynomials. Moreover, we provide a companion for each of the new families of local permutation polynomials that we introduce.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of subshifts and infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the complexity functions of subshifts up to asymptotic equivalence. The complexity function of every aperiodic function is non-decreasing, submultiplicative and grows at least linearly. We prove that conversely, every function satisfying these conditions is asymptotically equivalent to the complexity function of a recurrent subshift, equivalently, a recurrent infinite word. Our construction is explicit, algorithmic in nature and is philosophically based on constructing certain 'Cantor sets of integers', whose 'gaps' correspond to blocks of zeros. We also prove that every non-decreasing submultiplicative function is asymptotically equivalent, up a linear error term, to the complexity function of a minimal subshift.</description>

      <title>The Comma Sequence is Finite in Other Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The comma sequence (1, 12, 35, 94, \dots) is the lexicographically earliest sequence such that the difference of consecutive terms equals the concatenation of the digits on either side of the comma separating them. The behavior of a ``generalized comma sequence'' depends on the base the numbers are written in, as well as the sequence's initial values. We provide a computational proof that all comma sequences in bases 3 through 19, as well as 22 and 23, are finite. Relying on a combinatorial conjecture, Angelini et al.~estimated that the final element of a comma sequence in base $b$ should be roughly $\exp(O(b))$. We prove their conjecture, but provide evidence that the correct estimate is actually $\exp(O(b \log b))$.</description>

      <title>Rapid mixing of the down-up walk on matchings of a fixed size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and let $m^*(G)$ denote the size of a maximum matching in $G$. We show that for any $\delta &gt; 0$ and for any $1 \leq k \leq (1-\delta)m^*(G)$, the down-up walk on matchings of size $k$ in $G$ mixes in time polynomial in $n$. Previously, polynomial mixing was not known even for graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, and our result makes progress on a conjecture of Jain, Perkins, Sah, and Sawhney [STOC, 2022] that the down-up walk mixes in optimal time $O_{\Delta,\delta}(n\log{n})$.
  In contrast with recent works analyzing mixing of down-up walks in various settings using the spectral independence framework, we bound the spectral gap by constructing and analyzing a suitable multi-commodity flow. In fact, we present constructions demonstrating the limitations of the spectral independence approach in our setting.</description>

Abstract: After Gross, Hacking, Keel, Kontsevich [GHKK18] introduced the theta basis which is shown to be indexed by its highest term exponent in cluster variables of any given seed, we are interested in all the non-vanishing exponents in these cluster variables. We prove that the coefficients of the exponents of any cluster variable of type $A_n$ are log-concave. We show that the cluster monomials of $A_2$ type are log-concave. As for larger generality, we conjecture that the log-concavity of cluster monomials is also true.</description>

      <title>Co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. Associate a graph $\mathcal{E}_G$ (called the co-Engel graph of $G$) with $G$ whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $[x, {}_k y] \neq 1$ and $[y, {}_k x] \neq 1$ for all positive integer $k$. This graph, under the name ``Engel graph'', was introduced by Abdollahi. Let $L(G)$ be the set of all left Engel elements of $G$. In this paper, we realize the induced subgraph of co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups $G$ induced by $G \setminus L(G)$. We write $\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ to denote the subgraph of $\mathcal{E}_G$ induced by $G \setminus L(G)$. We also compute genus, various spectra, energies and Zagreb indices of $\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ for those groups. As a consequence, we determine (up to isomorphism) all finite non-Engel group $G$ such that the clique number is at most $4$ and $\mathcal{E}^-$ is toroidal or projective. Further, we show that $\coeng{G}$ is super integral and satisfies the E-LE conjecture and the Hansen--Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture for the groups considered in this paper.</description>

Abstract: The derived graph of a voltage graph consisting of a single vertex and two loops of different voltages is a circulant graph with two generators. We characterize the automorphism groups of connected, two-generator circulant graphs, and give their determining and distinguishing number, and when relevant, their cost of 2-distinguishing. We do the same for the subdivisions of connected, two-generator circulant graphs obtained by replacing one loop in the voltage graph with a directed cycle.</description>

      <title>Partition regularity of Pythagorean pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a core partition regularity problem in Ramsey theory by proving that every finite coloring of the positive integers contains monochromatic Pythagorean pairs, i.e., $x,y\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x^2\pm y^2=z^2$ for some $z\in \mathbb{N}$. We also show that partitions generated by level sets of multiplicative functions taking finitely many values always contain Pythagorean triples. Our proofs combine known Gowers uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions with a novel and rather flexible approach based on concentration estimates of multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Primed decomposition tableaux and extended queer crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous work introduced a category of extended queer crystals, whose connected normal objects have unique highest weight elements and characters that are Schur $Q$-polynomials. The initial models for such crystals were based on semistandard shifted tableaux. Here, we introduce a simpler construction using certain "primed" decomposition tableaux, which slightly generalize the decomposition tableaux used in work of Grantcharov et al. This leads to a new, shorter proof of the highest weight properties of the normal subcategory of extended queer crystals. Along the way, we analyze a primed extension of Grantcharov et al.'s insertion scheme for decomposition tableaux.</description>

      <title>The common basis complex and the partial decomposition poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, the common basis complex of $V$ is the simplicial complex whose vertices are the proper non-zero subspaces of $V$, and $\sigma$ is a simplex if and only if there exists a basis $B$ of $V$ that contains a basis of $S$ for all $S\in \sigma$. This complex was introduced by Rognes in 1992 in connection with stable buildings. In this article, we prove that the common basis complex is homotopy equivalent to the proper part of the poset of partial direct sum decompositions of $V$. Moreover, we establish this result in a more general combinatorial context, including the case of free groups, matroids, vector spaces with non-degenerate sesquilinear forms, and free modules over commutative Hermite rings, such as local rings or Dedekind domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conjecture an extension to Bressoud's 1996 generalization of Borwein's famous 1990 conjecture. We then state a few infinite hierarchies of non-negative $q$-series identities which are interesting examples of our proposed conjecture and Bressoud's generalized conjecture. Finally, using certain positivity-preserving transformations for $q$-binomial coefficients, we prove the non-negativity of the infinite families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address partition regularity problems for homogeneous quadratic equations. A consequence of our main results is that, under natural conditions on the coefficients $a,b,c$, for any finite coloring of the positive integers, there exists a solution to $ax^2+by^2=cz^2$ where $x$ and $y$ have the same color (and similar results for $x,z$ and $y,z$). For certain choices of $(a,b,c)$, our result is conditional on an Elliott-type conjecture. Our proofs build on and extend previous arguments of the authors dealing with the Pythagorean equation. We make use of new uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions and concentration estimates for multiplicative functions along arbitrary binary quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fourier transform plays a central role in many geometric and combinatorial problems cast in vector spaces over finite fields. In general, sets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform are less structured, more `random', and can often be analysed more easily. In many cases obtaining good \emph{uniform} bounds is not possible, even if `most' points admit good pointwise bounds. Motivated by this, we propose a more nuanced approach where one seeks to bound the $L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform instead of only the maximum. We explore this idea by considering several examples and find that a rich theory emerges. Further, we provide various applications of this new approach; including to sumset type problems, the finite fields distance conjecture, and the problem of counting $k$-simplices inside a given set.</description>

      <title>The commutant of divided difference operators, Klyachko's genus, and the comaj statistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Hamaker-Pechenik-Speyer-Weigandt, Nenashev, Pechenik-Weigandt] are studied certain operators on polynomials and power series that commute with all divided difference operators $\partial_i$. We introduce a second set of "martial" operators {\martial_i} that generate the full commutant, and show how a Hopf-algebraic approach naturally reproduces the operators $\xi^\nu$ from [Nenashev]. We then pause to study Klyachko's homomorphism $H^*(Fl(n)) \to H^*($the permutahedral toric variety$)$, and extract the part of it relevant to Schubert calculus, the "affine-linear genus''. This genus is then re-obtained using Leibniz combinations of the {\martial_i}. We use Nadeau-Tewari's $q$-analogue of Klyachko's genus to study the equidistribution of $\ell$ and comaj on $[n]\choose k$, generalizing known results on $S_n$.</description>

      <title>Wythoff's Nim with Finite Alterations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wythoff's Nim is a variant of 2-pile Nim in which players are allowed to take any positive number of stones from pile 1, or any positive number of stones from pile 2, or the same positive number from both piles. The player who makes the last move wins. It is well-known that the P-positions (losing positions) are precisely those where the two piles have sizes $\{\lfloor \phi n \rfloor, \lfloor \phi^2n \rfloor \}$ for some integer $n\geq 0$, and $\phi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2 = 1.6180\cdots$.
  In this paper we consider an altered form of Wythoff's Nim where an arbitrary finite set of positions are designated to be P or N positions. The values of the remaining positions are computed in the normal fashion for the game. We prove that the set of P-positions of the altered game closely resembles that of a translated normal Wythoff game. In fact the fraction of overlap of the sets of P-positions of these two games approaches $1$ as the pile sizes being considered go to infinity.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Degenerate Simplex Pivots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplex algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms to solve linear programs (LPs). Starting at an extreme point solution of an LP, it performs a sequence of basis exchanges (called pivots) that allows one to move to a better extreme point along an improving edge-direction of the underlying polyhedron. A key issue in the simplex algorithm's performance is degeneracy, which may lead to a (potentially long) sequence of basis exchanges which do not change the current extreme point solution. In this paper, we prove that it is always possible to limit the number of consecutive degenerate pivots that the simplex algorithm performs to $n-m-1$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of equality constraints of a given LP in standard equality form.</description>

Abstract: We have revised the softness property introduced by J\"org Brendle and Haim Judah (perfect sets of random reals. Israel J. Math., 83(1-2):153-176, 1993), to present a new definition of a class of posets called $\sigma$-soft-linked. Our work demonstrates that these posets work well to preserve the evasion number as well as the bounding number small in generic extensions. Furthermore, we establish a connection between our concept and the Fr\'echet-linked notion introduced by Diego A. Mej\'ia (Matrix iterations with vertical support restrictions. In Proceedings of the 14th1 and 15th Asian Logic Conferences, pages 213-248. World Sci. Publ., Hackensack, NJ, 2019).</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

      <title>The Support Designs of Several Families of Lifted Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generator matrix of a linear code $\C$ over $\gf(q)$ is also a matrix of the same rank $k$ over any extension field $\gf(q^\ell)$ and generates a linear code of the same length, same dimension and same minimum distance over $\gf(q^\ell)$, denoted by $\C(q|q^\ell)$ and called a lifted code of $\C$. Although $\C$ and their lifted codes $\C(q|q^\ell)$ have the same parameters, they have different weight distributions and different applications. Few results about lifted linear codes are known in the literature. This paper proves some fundamental theory for lifted linear codes, and studies the support $2$-designs of the lifted projective Reed-Muller codes, lifted Hamming codes and lifted Simplex codes. In addition, this paper settles the weight distributions of the lifted Reed-Muller codes of certain orders, and investigates the support $3$-designs of these lifted codes. As a by-product, an infinite family of three-weight projective codes over $\gf(4)$ is obtained.</description>

      <title>Rumour Spreading Depends on the Latent Geometry and Degree Distribution in Social Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study push-pull rumour spreading in small-world models for social networks where the degrees follow a power-law. In a non-geometric setting Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread fast (SODA 2012). On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs), which has been found to be a good theoretical and empirical fit for social networks. Our result is two-fold: with classical Euclidean geometry both slow and fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the prevalence of weak ties in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries between those two regimes. Depending on the parameters, fast spreading may either mean polylogarithmic time or even doubly logarithmic time. Secondly, we show that rumour spreading is always fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Classical Euclidean Geometry fails to capture such ties.
  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths. A vertex of degree $d$ can transmit the rumour efficiently to a vertex of larger degree by a chain of length $3$, where one of the two intermediaries has constant degree, and the other has degree $d^{c}$ for some constant $c&lt;1$.</description>
