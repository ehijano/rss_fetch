      <title>An Agentic AI Workflow to Simplify Parameter Estimation of Complex Differential Equation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter identification for mechanistic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models underpins prediction and control in several applications, yet remains a labor-intensive and brittle process: datasets are noisy and partial, models can be stiff or misspecified, and differentiable implementations demand framework expertise. An agentic AI workflow is presented that converts a lightweight, human-readable specification into a compiled, parallel, and differentiable calibration pipeline. Users supply an XML description of the problem and fill in a Python code skeleton; the agent automatically validates consistency between spec and code, and auto-remediates common pathologies. It transforms Python callables into pure JAX functions for efficient just-in-time compilation and parallelization. The system then orchestrates a two-stage search comprising global exploration of the parameter space followed by gradient-based refinement. The result is an AD-native, reproducible workflow that lowers the barrier to advanced calibration while preserving expert control. An open-source implementation with a documented API and examples is released, enabling rapid movement from problem statement to fitted, auditable models with minimal boilerplate.</description>

      <title>A Unified Data-Driven Framework for Efficient Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery drives progress across disciplines, from fundamental physics to industrial applications. However, identifying physical laws automatically from gathered datasets requires identifying the structure and parameters of the formula underlying the data, which involves navigating a vast search space and consuming substantial computational resources. To address these issues, we build on the Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem and Taylor's theorem to create a unified representation of diverse formulas, which introduces latent variables to form a two-stage structure. To minimize the search space, we initially focus on determining the structure of the latent formula, including the relevant contributing inputs, the count of latent variables, and their interconnections. Following this, the process of parameter identification is expedited by enforcing dimensional constraints for physical relevance, favoring simplicity in the formulas, and employing strategic optimization techniques. Any overly complex outcomes are refined using symbolic regression for a compact form. These general strategic techniques drastically reduce search iterations from hundreds of millions to just tens, significantly enhancing the efficiency of data-driven formula discovery. We performed comprehensive validation to demonstrate FIND's effectiveness in discovering physical laws, dimensionless numbers, partial differential equations, and uniform critical system parameters across various fields, including astronomy, physics, chemistry, and electronics. The excellent performances across 11 distinct datasets position FIND as a powerful and versatile tool for advancing data-driven scientific discovery in multiple domains.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Driven Hierarchical Sampling for Unbalanced Continual Malware Detection with Time-Series Update-Based Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Android malware detection continues to face persistent challenges stemming from long-term concept drift and class imbalance, as evolving malicious behaviors and shifting usage patterns dynamically reshape feature distributions. Although continual learning (CL) mitigates drift, existing replay-based methods suffer from inherent bias. Specifically, their reliance on classifier uncertainty for sample selection disproportionately prioritizes the dominant benign class, causing overfitting and reduced generalization to evolving malware. To address these limitations, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided CL framework. First, we introduce a hierarchical balanced sampler that employs a dual-phase uncertainty strategy to dynamically balance benign and malicious samples while simultaneously selecting high-information, high-uncertainty instances within each class. This mechanism ensures class equilibrium across both replay and incremental data, thereby enhancing adaptability to emerging threats. Second, we augment the framework with a vector retrieval mechanism that exploits historical malware embeddings to identify evolved variants via similarity-based retrieval, thereby complementing classifier updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict low-label conditions (50 labels per phase). It achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of 92.95\% and a mean accuracy (mACC) of 94.26\%, which validates its efficacy for sustainable Android malware detection.</description>

      <title>LSMTCR: A Scalable Multi-Architecture Model for Epitope-Specific T Cell Receptor de novo Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07627v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing full-length, epitope-specific TCR $\alpha\beta$ remains challenging due to vast sequence space, data biases and incomplete modeling of immunogenetic constraints. We present LSMTCR, a scalable multi-architecture framework that separates specificity from constraint learning to enable de novo, epitope-conditioned generation of paired, full-length TCRs. A diffusion-enhanced BERT encoder learns time-conditioned epitope representations; conditional GPT decoders, pretrained on CDR3$\beta$ and transferred to CDR3$\alpha$, generate chain-specific CDR3s under cross-modal conditioning with temperature-controlled diversity; and a gene-aware Transformer assembles complete $\alpha\beta$ sequences by predicting V/J usage to ensure immunogenetic fidelity. Across GLIPH, TEP, MIRA, McPAS and our curated dataset, LSMTCR achieves higher predicted binding than baselines on most datasets, more faithfully recovers positional and length grammars, and delivers superior, temperature-tunable diversity. For $\alpha$-chain generation, transfer learning improves predicted binding, length realism and diversity over representative methods. Full-length assembly from known or de novo CDR3s preserves k-mer spectra, yields low edit distances to references, and, in paired $\alpha\beta$ co-modelling with epitope, attains higher pTM/ipTM than single-chain settings. LSMTCR outputs diverse, gene-contextualized, full-length TCR designs from epitope input alone, enabling high-throughput screening and iterative optimization.</description>

      <title>Generalized eigenvalue stabilization for immersed explicit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit time integration for immersed finite element discretizations severely suffers from the influence of poorly cut elements. In this contribution, we propose a generalized eigenvalue stabilization (GEVS) strategy for the element mass matrices of cut elements to cure their adverse impact on the critical time step size of the global system. We use spectral basis functions, specifically $C^0$ continuous Lagrangian interpolation polynomials defined on Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) points, which, in combination with its associated GLL quadrature rule, yield high-order convergent diagonal mass matrices for uncut elements. Moreover, considering cut elements, we combine the proposed GEVS approach with the finite cell method (FCM) to guarantee definiteness of the system matrices. However, the proposed GEVS stabilization can directly be applied to other immersed boundary finite element methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the stabilization strategy achieves optimal convergence rates and recovers critical time step sizes of equivalent boundary-conforming discretizations. This also holds in the presence of weakly enforced Dirichlet boundary conditions using either Nitsche's method or penalty formulations.</description>

      <title>Towards automatizing detection and quantification of intestinal metaplasia: a multi-expert comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current gastric cancer risk systems are prone to errors since they evaluate a visual estimation of intestinal metaplasia percentages to assign a risk. This study presents an automated method to detect and quantify intestinal metaplasia using deep learning models as well as a comparative analysis with visual estimations of three experienced pathologists. Gastric samples were collected from two different cohorts: 149 asymptomatic volunteers from a region with a high prevalence of GCa in Colombia and 56 patients from a third-level hospital. Deep learning models were selected and trained to classify intestinal metaplasia, and predictions were used to estimate the percentage of intestinal metaplasia and assign the risk score. Results were compared with independent blinded assessments performed by three experienced pathologists. The best-performing deep learning architecture classified intestinal metaplasia with F1-Score of 0.80 +- 0.01 and AUC of 0.91 +- 0.01. Among pathologists, inter-observer agreement by a Fleiss's Kappa score ranged from 0.61 to 0.75. In comparison, agreement between the pathologists and the best-performing model ranged from 0.37 to 0.54. Deep learning models show potential to detect and quantify the percentage of intestinal metaplasia with greater precision and reproducibility than experienced pathologists. Likewise, estimated risk shows high inter-observer variability when visually assigning the intestinal metaplasia percentage.</description>

      <title>A multi-strategy improved gazelle optimization algorithm for solving numerical optimization and engineering applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%, respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization problems.</description>

This paper introduces a concise topology optimization Python code, named ``\texttt{PyHexTop}," primarily intended for educational purposes. Code employs hexagonal elements to parameterize design domains as such elements provide checkerboard-free optimized design naturally. \texttt{PyHexTop} is developed based on the ``\texttt{HoneyTop90}" MATLAB code~\cite{kumar2023honeytop90} and uses the \texttt{NumPy} and \texttt{SciPy} libraries. Code is straightforward and easily comprehensible, proving a helpful tool that can help people new in the topology optimization field to learn and explore. \texttt{PyHexTop} is specifically tailored to address compliance minimization with specified volume constraints. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the code for solving the Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm beam and extensions to solve problems different problems.

      <description>arXiv:2310.02069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that can automate diverse topology optimization (TO) problems having different underlying physics. The architecture uses the encoder-decoder networks with dense layers in the middle which includes an additional adaptive layer to capture complex geometrical features. The network is trained using the dataset obtained from the three open-source TO codes involving different physics. The robustness and success of the presented adaptive CNN are demonstrated on compliance minimization problems with constant and design-dependent loads and material bulk modulus optimization. The architecture takes the user's input of the volume fraction. It instantly generates optimized designs resembling their counterparts obtained via open-source TO codes with negligible performance and volume fraction error.</description>

      <title>Select2Drive: Pragmatic Communications for Real-Time Collaborative Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything communications-assisted autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with pragmatic communications (PragComm) emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time collaboration among vehicles and other agents. Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reusable Surrogate Models for Distillation Columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling is a powerful methodology in chemical process engineering, frequently employed to accelerate optimization tasks where traditional flowsheet simulators are computationally prohibitive. However, the state-of-the-art is dominated by surrogate models trained for a narrow range of fixed chemical systems and operating conditions, limiting their reusability. This work introduces a paradigm shift towards reusable surrogates by developing a single model for distillation columns that generalizes across a vast design space. The key enabler is a novel ML-fueled modelfluid representation which allows for the generation of datasets of more than $1,000,000$ samples. This allows the surrogate to generalize not only over column specifications but also over the entire chemical space of homogeneous ternary vapor-liquid mixtures. We validate the model's accuracy and demonstrate its practical utility in a case study on entrainer distillation, where it successfully screens and ranks candidate entrainers, significantly reducing the computational effort compared to rigorous optimization.</description>

      <title>Expanding Hardware-Efficiently Manipulable Hilbert Space via Hamiltonian Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many promising quantum applications depend on the efficient quantum simulation of an exponentially large sparse Hamiltonian, a task known as sparse Hamiltonian simulation, which is fundamentally important in quantum computation. Although several theoretically appealing quantum algorithms have been proposed for this task, they typically require a black-box query model of the sparse Hamiltonian, rendering them impractical for near-term implementation on quantum devices.
  In this paper, we propose a technique named Hamiltonian embedding. This technique simulates a desired sparse Hamiltonian by embedding it into the evolution of a larger and more structured quantum system, allowing for more efficient simulation through hardware-efficient operations. We conduct a systematic study of this new technique and demonstrate significant savings in computational resources for implementing prominent quantum applications. As a result, we can now experimentally realize quantum walks on complicated graphs (e.g., binary trees, glued-tree graphs), quantum spatial search, and the simulation of real-space Schr\"odinger equations on current trapped-ion and neutral-atom platforms. Given the fundamental role of Hamiltonian evolution in the design of quantum algorithms, our technique markedly expands the horizon of implementable quantum advantages in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>CAME-AB: Cross-Modality Attention with Mixture-of-Experts for Antibody Binding Site Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific binding sites on the antigens. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CAME-AB}, a novel Cross-modality Attention framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs, into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an \emph{adaptive modality fusion} module that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes are available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CAME-AB-C525</description>
