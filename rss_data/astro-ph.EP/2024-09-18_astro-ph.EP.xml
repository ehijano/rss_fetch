      <title>The Sun's Birth Environment: Context for Meteoritics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteorites trace planet formation in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, but they also record the influence of the Sun's birth environment. Whether the Sun formed in a region like Taurus-Auriga with ~10^2 stars, or a region like the Carina Nebula with ~10^6 stars, matters for how large the Sun's disk was, for how long and from how far away it accreted gas from the molecular cloud, and how it acquired radionuclides like 26Al. To provide context for the interpretation of meteoritic data, we review what is known about the Sun's birth environment. Based on an inferred gas disk outer radius ~50-90 AU, radial transport in the disk, and the abundances of noble gases in Jupiter's atmosphere, the Sun's molecular cloud and protoplanetary disk were exposed to an ultraviolet flux G0 ~30-3000 during its birth and first ~10 Myr of evolution. Based on the orbits of Kuiper Belt objects, the Solar System was subsequently exposed to a stellar density ~100 Msol/pc^3 for ~100 Myr, strongly implying formation in a bound cluster. These facts suggest formation in a region like the outskirts of the Orion Nebula, perhaps 2 pc from the center. The protoplanetary disk might have accreted gas for many Myr, but a few x10^5 yr seems more likely. It probably inherited radionuclides from its molecular cloud, enriched by inputs from supernovae and especially Wolf-Rayet star winds, and acquired a typical amount of 26Al.</description>

      <title>SPORES-HWO. II. Limits on Planetary Companions of Future High-contrast Imaging Targets from $&gt;$20 Years of HIRES and HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future large, space-based observatories with starlight suppression technology, e.g., the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will directly image and characterize nearby Earth-like exoplanets. Prior limits on planet masses and system architectures from radial velocity (RV) measurements of potential exo-Earth hosts are critical to the success of HWO's science goals. Here, we present a uniform analysis of archival RVs from HIRES/Keck and HARPS/ESO of the most promising targets for the HWO exo-Earth survey. We analyze RVs and stellar activity indicators of 90 stars in the NASA ExEP Mission Star List and SPORES-HWO Catalog, finding 33 Keplerian signals associated with known planets and 12 signals associated with stellar activity. We also identify 5 new RV signals that we classify as either planet candidates or sources requiring confirmation, noting that the RV observations are biased toward cooler and less active stars. Assessing the sensitivity of the HIRES and HARPS data, we calculate RV limits ranging from $K_{\rm RV} = 0.6 \,{\rm m\,s}^{-1}$ (HD 10700) to $371 \,{\rm m\,s}^{-1}$ (HD 17925) in the middle of the conservative habitable zone (HZ), corresponding to projected planet masses of $5.4 \,{\rm M_\oplus}$ and $10.6 \,{\rm M_{Jup}}$ for those stars. The median HZ sensitivity limit of our sample is $M_{\rm p} \sin i \simeq 66 \,{\rm M_\oplus}$. This work demonstrates the need for future extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) monitoring of high-priority targets for the next generation of DI missions that will search for habitable extrasolar systems. We advocate for the use of these results in developing future EPRV strategies.</description>

      <title>Substantial extension of the lifetime of the terrestrial biosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximately one billion years (Gyr) in the future, as the Sun brightens, Earth's carbonate-silicate cycle is expected to drive CO$_2$ below the minimum level required by vascular land plants, eliminating most macroscopic land life. Here, we couple global-mean models of temperature- and CO$_2$-dependent plant productivity for C$_3$ and C$_4$ plants, silicate weathering, and climate to re-examine the time remaining for terrestrial plants. If weathering is weakly temperature-dependent (as recent data suggest) and/or strongly CO$_2$-dependent, we find that the interplay between climate, productivity, and weathering causes the future luminosity-driven CO$_2$ decrease to slow and temporarily reverse, averting plant CO$_2$ starvation. This dramatically lengthens plant survival from 1 Gyr up to $\sim$1.6-1.86 Gyr, until extreme temperatures halt photosynthesis, suggesting a revised kill mechanism for land plants and potential doubling of the future lifespan of Earth's land macrobiota. An increased future lifespan for the complex biosphere may imply that Earth life had to achieve a smaller number of ``hard steps'' (unlikely evolutionary transitions) to produce intelligent life than previously estimated. These results also suggest that complex photosynthetic land life on Earth and exoplanets may be able to persist until the onset of the moist greenhouse transition.</description>

      <title>A close pair of orbiters embedded in a gaseous disk: the repulsive effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework and use two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to study the repulsive effect between two close orbiters embedded in an accretion disk. We consider orbiters on fixed Keplerian orbits with masses low enough to open shallow gaps. The simulations indicate that the repulsion is larger for more massive orbiters and decreases with the orbital separation and the disk's viscosity. We use two different assumptions to derive theoretical scaling relations for the repulsion. A first scenario assumes that each orbiter absorbs the angular momentum deposited in its horseshoe region by the companion's wake. A second scenario assumes that the corotation torques of the orbiters are modified because the companion changes the underlying radial gradient of the disk surface density. We find a substantial difference between the predictions of these two scenarios. The first one fails to reproduce the scaling of the repulsion with the disk viscosity and generally overestimates the strength of the repulsion. The second scenario, however, gives results that are broadly consistent with those obtained in the simulations.</description>

      <title>The Spin Zone: Synchronously and Asynchronously Rotating Exoplanets Have Spectral Differences in Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New observational facilities are beginning to enable insights into the three-dimensional (3D) nature of exoplanets. Transmission spectroscopy is the most widely used method for characterizing transiting temperate exoplanet's atmospheres, but because it only provides a glimpse of the planet's limb and nightside for a typical orbit, its ability to probe 3D characteristics is still an active area of research. Here, we use the ROCKE-3D general circulation model to test the impact of rotation rate, a ``low-order'' 3D characteristic previously shown to drive differences in planetary phase curves, on the transmission spectrum of a representative super-Earth across temperate-to-warm instellations (S$_p$=0.8, 1, 1.25, 1.66, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 4.56 S$_\oplus$). We find that different rotation regimes do display differences in their transmission spectra, primarily driven by clouds and humidity, and that the differences shrink or disappear in hotter regimes where water clouds are unable to condense (though our simulations do not consider haze formation). The small size of the feature differences and potential for degeneracy with other properties, like differing water content or atmospheric structure, mean that we do not specifically claim to have identified a single transmission diagnostic for rotation rate, but our results can be used for holistic spectrum interpretation and sample creation, and suggest the need for more modelling in this area.</description>

      <title>Short-Lived Gravitational Instability in Isolated Irradiated Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irradiation from the central star controls the temperature structure in protoplanetary discs. Yet simulations of gravitational instability typically use models of stellar irradiation with varying complexity, or ignore it altogether, assuming heat generated by spiral shocks is balanced by cooling, leading to a self-regulated state. In this paper, we perform simulations of irradiated, gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs using 3D hydrodynamics coupled with live Monte-Carlo radiative transfer. We find that the resulting temperature profile is approximately constant in time, since the thermal effects of the star dominate. Hence, the disc cannot regulate gravitational instabilities by adjusting the temperatures in the disc. In a 0.1 Solar mass disc, the disc instead adjusts by angular momentum transport induced by the spiral arms, leading to steadily decreasing surface density, and hence quenching of the instability. Thus, strong spiral arms caused by self-gravity would not persist for longer than ten thousand years in the absence of fresh infall, although weak spiral structures remain present over longer timescales. Using synthetic images at 1.3mm, we find that spirals formed in irradiated discs are challenging to detect. In higher mass discs, we find that fragmentation is likely because the dominant stellar irradiation overwhelms the stabilising influence of PdV work and shock heating in the spiral arms.</description>

      <title>Evolution of gas envelopes and outgassed atmospheres of rocky planets formed via pebble accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here results of numerical simulations of the formation and early evolution of rocky planets through pebble accretion, with an with an emphasis on hydrogen envelope longevity and the composition of the outgassed atmosphere. We model planets with a range in mass from 0.1 to 5 Earth masses that orbit between 0.7 and 1.7 AU. The composition of the outgassed atmosphere is calculated with the partial pressure of free oxygen fit to geophysical models of magma ocean self-oxidation. XUV radiation powered photoevaporation is considered as the main driver of atmospheric escape. We model planets that remain below the pebble isolation mass and hence accrete tenuous envelopes only. We consider slow, medium or fast initial stellar rotation for the temporal evolution of the XUV flux. The loss of the envelope is a key event that allows the magma ocean to crystallise and outgas its bulk volatiles. The atmospheric composition of the majority of our simulated planets is dominated by CO$_2$. Our planets accrete a total of 11.6 Earth oceans of water, the majority of which enters the core. The hydrospheres of planets lighter than the Earth reach several times the mass of the Earth's modern oceans, while the hydrospheres of planets ranging from 1 to 3.5 Earth masses are comparable to those of our planet. However, planets of 4-5 Earth masses have smaller hydrospheres due to trapping of volatiles in their massive mantles. Overall, our simulations demonstrate that hydrogen envelopes are easily lost from rocky planets and that this envelope loss triggers the most primordial partitioning of volatiles between the solid mantle and the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Self-oxidation of the atmospheres of rocky planets with implications for the origin of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocky planets may acquire a primordial atmosphere by outgassing of volatiles from their magma ocean. The distribution of O between H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$ in chemical equilibrium subsequently changes significantly with decreasing temperature. We explore here two chemical models: one where CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ are assumed to be irrevocably destroyed by photolysis, and one where these molecules persist. In the first case, we show that CO cannot co-exist with H$_2$O, since CO oxidizes at low temperatures to form CO$_2$ and H$_2$. In both cases, H escapes from the thermosphere within a few ten million years by absorption of stellar XUV radiation. This escape drives an atmospheric self-oxidation process whereby rocky planet atmospheres become dominated by CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, regardless of their initial oxidation state at outgassing. HCN is considered a potential precursor of prebiotic compounds and RNA. Our oxidizing atmospheres are inefficient at producing HCN by lightning. Instead, we demonstrate that lightning-produced NO, which dissolves as nitrate in the oceans, and interplanetary dust particles may be the main sources of fixed nitrogen to emerging biospheres. Our results highlight the need for origin-of-life scenarios where the first metabolism fixes its C from CO$_2$, rather than from HCN and CO.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of TOI-406 as showcase of the THIRSTEE program: A 2-planet system straddling the M-dwarf density gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exoplanet sub-Neptune population currently poses a conundrum. Are small-size planets volatile-rich cores without atmosphere, or are they rocky cores surrounded by H-He envelope? To test the different hypotheses from an observational point of view, a large sample of small-size planets with precise mass and radius measurements is the first necessary step. On top of that, much more information will likely be needed, including atmospheric characterisation and a demographic perspective on their bulk properties. We present the concept and strategy of THIRSTEE, a project which aims at shedding light on the composition of the sub-Neptune population across stellar types by increasing their number and improving the accuracy of bulk density measurements, as well as investigating their atmospheres and performing statistical, demographic analysis. We report the first results of the program, characterising a 2-planet system around the M dwarf TOI-406. We analyse TESS and ground-based photometry, together with ESPRESSO and NIRPS/HARPS RVs to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal composition of the 2 planets orbiting TOI-406, which have radii and masses of $R_b = 1.32 \pm 0.12 R_{\oplus}$, $M_b = 2.08_{-0.22}^{+0.23} M_{\oplus}$ and $R_c = 2.08_{-0.15}^{+0.16} R_{\oplus}$, $M_c = 6.57_{-0.90}^{+1.00} M_{\oplus}$, and periods of $3.3$ and $13.2$ days, respectively. Planet b is consistent with an Earth-like composition, while planet c is compatible with multiple internal composition models, including volatile-rich planets without H/He atmospheres. The 2 planets are located in 2 distinct regions in the mass-density diagram, supporting the existence of a density gap among small exoplanets around M dwarfs. With an equilibrium temperature of only 368 K, TOI-406 c stands up as a particularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation with JWST in the low-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Icy Cometary 'Impacts' on Exoplanetary Atmospheres I: Tidally-Locked Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impacts by rocky and icy bodies are thought to have played a key role in shaping the composition of solar system objects, including the Earth's habitability. Hence, it is likely that they play a similar role in exoplanetary systems. We investigate how an icy cometary impact affects the atmospheric chemistry, climate, and composition of an Earth-like, tidally-locked, terrestrial exoplanet, a prime target in the search for a habitable exoplanet beyond our solar system. We couple a cometary impact model which includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup with the 3D Earth System Model WACCM6/CESM2, and use this model to investigate the effects of the water and thermal energy delivery associated with an $R=2.5$ km pure water ice cometary impact on an Earth-like atmosphere. We find that water is the primary driver of longer timescale changes to the atmospheric chemistry and composition by acting as a source of opacity, cloud ice, and atmospheric hydrogen/oxygen. The water opacity drives heating at $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ bar, and cooling below, due to a decreased flux reaching the surface. The increase in atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen also drives an increase in the abundance of hydrogen/oxygen rich molecules, with the exception of ozone, whose column density decreases by $\sim10\%$. These atmospheric changes are potentially observable for $\sim$ 1-2 years post-impact, particularly those associated with cloud ice scattering. They also persist, albeit at a much reduced level, to our quasi-steady-state, suggesting that sustained bombardment or multiple large impacts have the potential to shape the composition and habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Quartz Clouds in the Dayside Atmosphere of the Quintessential Hot Jupiter HD 189733 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent mid-infrared observations with JWST/MIRI have resulted in the first direct detections of absorption features from silicate clouds in the transmission spectra of two transiting exoplanets, WASP-17 b and WASP-107 b. In this paper, we measure the mid-infrared ($5-12$ $\mu$m) dayside emission spectrum of the benchmark hot Jupiter HD 189733 b with MIRI LRS by combining data from two secondary eclipse observations. We confirm the previous detection of H$_2$O absorption at 6.5 $\mu$m from Spitzer/IRS and additionally detect H$_2$S as well as an absorption feature at 8.7 $\mu$m in both secondary eclipse observations. The excess absorption at 8.7 $\mu$m can be explained by the presence of small ($\sim$0.01 $\mu$m) grains of SiO$_2$[s] in the uppermost layers of HD 189733 b's dayside atmosphere. This is the first direct detection of silicate clouds in HD 189733 b's atmosphere, and the first detection of a distinct absorption feature from silicate clouds on the day side of any hot Jupiter. We find that models including SiO$_2$[s] are preferred by $6-7\sigma$ over clear models and those with other potential cloud species. The high altitude location of these silicate particles is best explained by formation in the hottest regions of HD 189733 b's dayside atmosphere near the substellar point. We additionally find that HD 189733 b's emission spectrum longward of 9 $\mu$m displays residual features not well captured by our current atmospheric models. When combined with other JWST observations of HD 189733 b's transmission and emission spectrum at shorter wavelengths, these observations will provide us with the most detailed picture to date of the atmospheric composition and cloud properties of this benchmark hot Jupiter.</description>

      <title>The Juno Mission as a Probe of Long-Range New Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbits of celestial objects, especially the geocentric and heliocentric ones, have been well explored to constrain new long-range forces beyond the Standard Model (SM), often referred to as fifth forces. In this paper, for the first time, we apply the motion of a spacecraft around Jupiter to probe fifth forces that don't violate the equivalence principle. The spacecraft is the Juno orbiter, and ten of its early orbits already allow a precise determination of the Jovian gravitational field. We use the shift in the precession angle as a proxy to test non-gravitational interactions between Juno and Jupiter. Requiring that the contribution from the fifth force does not exceed the uncertainty of the precession shift inferred from data, we find that a new parameter space with the mass of the fifth-force mediator around $10^{-14}$ eV is excluded at 95% C.L.</description>

      <title>AESOPUS 2.1: Low-Temperature Opacities Extended to High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the critical need for accurate Rosseland mean gas opacities in high-pressure environments, spanning temperatures from 100 K to 32000 K. Current opacity tables from Wichita State University and AESOPUS 2.0 are limited to $\log(R) \le 1$, where $R=\rho\, T_6^{-3}$ in units of $\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}(10^6\mathrm{K})^{-3}$. This is insufficient for modeling very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planets with atmospheres exhibiting higher densities and pressures ($\log(R) &gt; 1$). Leveraging extensive databases such as ExoMol, ExoMolOP, MoLLIST, and HITEMP, we focus on expanding the AESOPUS opacity calculations to cover a broad range of pressure and density conditions ($-8 \leq \log(R) \leq +6$). We incorporate the thermal Doppler mechanism and micro-turbulence velocity. Pressure broadening effects on molecular transitions, leading to Lorentzian or Voigt profiles, are explored in the context of atmospheric profiles for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars. We also delve into the impact of electron degeneracy and non-ideal effects such as ionization potential depression under high-density conditions, emphasizing its notable influence on Rosseland mean opacities at temperatures exceeding $10,000$ K. As a result, this study expands AESOPUS public web interface for customized gas chemical mixtures, promoting flexibility in opacity calculations based on specific research needs. Additionally, pre-computed opacity tables, inclusive of condensates, are provided. We present a preliminary application to evolutionary models for very low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Spot Modeling through Multiband Photometry Analysis of V1298 Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Stellar activity consists of different phenomena, mainly spots and faculae, and it is one of the main sources of noise in exoplanetary observations because it affects both spectroscopic and photometric observations. If we want to study young active planetary systems we need to model the activity of the host stars in order to remove astrophysical noise from our observational data. Aims. We modelled the contribution of stellar spots in photometric observations. Through the use of multiband photometry, we aim to extract the geometric properties of the spots and constrain their temperature. Methods. We analyzed multiband photometric observations acquired with the 80 cm Marcon telescope of the Osservatorio Polifunzionale del Chianti of V1298 Tau, assuming that the photometric modulation observed in different bands should be due to cold spots. Results. We constrained the effective temperature of the active regions present on the surface of V1298 Tau, which is composed by the contemporary presence of spots and faculae. We tested our hypothesis on solar data, verifying that we measure the size of the dominant active region and its averaged effective temperature.</description>

      <title>Training Datasets Generation for Machine Learning: Application to Vision Based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Based Navigation consists in utilizing cameras as precision sensors for GNC after extracting information from images. To enable the adoption of machine learning for space applications, one of obstacles is the demonstration that available training datasets are adequate to validate the algorithms. The objective of the study is to generate datasets of images and metadata suitable for training machine learning algorithms. Two use cases were selected and a robust methodology was developed to validate the datasets including the ground truth. The first use case is in-orbit rendezvous with a man-made object: a mockup of satellite ENVISAT. The second use case is a Lunar landing scenario. Datasets were produced from archival datasets (Chang'e 3), from the laboratory at DLR TRON facility and at Airbus Robotic laboratory, from SurRender software high fidelity image simulator using Model Capture and from Generative Adversarial Networks. The use case definition included the selection of algorithms as benchmark: an AI-based pose estimation algorithm and a dense optical flow algorithm were selected. Eventually it is demonstrated that datasets produced with SurRender and selected laboratory facilities are adequate to train machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Chemical Classification of Spherules Recovered From The Pacific Ocean Site of The CNEOS 2014-01-08 (IM1) Bolide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive towed-magnetic-sled survey during the period of June 14-28, 2023, over the seafloor about 85 km north of Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, centered around the calculated path of the bolide CNEOS 2014-01-08 (IM1). We found about 850 spherules of diameter 0.1-1.3 millimeters in our samples. The samples were analyzed by micro-XRF, Electron Probe Microanalyzer and ICP Mass spectrometry. Here we report major and trace element compositions of the samples and classify spherules based on that analysis. Spherules comprising 22% of the collection, appear to all reflect planetary igneous differentiation and are all different from previously described spherules. A subset of the differentiated-spherules show an excess of Be, La and U, by up to three orders of magnitude relative to the solar system standard of CI chondrites. Detailed mass spectrometry of 12 of these "BeLaU"-type spherules, the population of which may constitute up to ~10% of our entire collected sample, suggests that they are derived from material formed by planetary igneous fractionation. Their chemical composition is unlike any known solar system material. The "BeLaU"-type spherules reflect a highly differentiated, extremely evolved composition of an unknown source.</description>

      <title>Unveiling habitable planets: Toy coronagraph tackles the exozodiacal dust challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets within habitable zones is challenging because faint signals can be obscured by exozodiacal dust, analogous to our solar system's zodiacal dust. This dust scatters starlight, creating a bright background noise. This paper introduces Toy Coronagraph, a Python package designed to quantify the impact of this dust on exoplanet detection. It takes circularly symmetric disk images point spread functions (PSFs), and exoplanet orbital parameters as input, generating key metrics like contrast curves, signal-to-noise ratios, and dynamic visualizations of exoplanet motion under the dust background. The package also provides tools for generating vortex coronagraph PSFs and includes example disk images. Toy Coronagraph empowers researchers to understand exozodiacal dust, develop mitigation strategies, and optimize future telescope designs and mission time, ultimately advancing the search for potentially habitable worlds. Future work will focus on handling non-circularly symmetric inputs, incorporating realistic noise models, and estimating exoplanet yield rates for future space telescope missions.</description>
