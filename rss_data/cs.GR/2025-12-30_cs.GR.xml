      <title>OpenPBR: Novel Features and Implementation Details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenPBR is a physically based, standardized uber-shader developed for interoperable material authoring and rendering across VFX, animation, and design visualization workflows. This document serves as a companion to the official specification, offering deeper insight into the model's development and more detailed implementation guidance, including code examples and mathematical derivations.
  We begin with a description of the model's formal structure and theoretical foundations - covering slab-based layering, statistical mixing, and microfacet theory - before turning to its physical components. These include metallic, dielectric, subsurface, and glossy-diffuse base substrates, followed by thin-film iridescence, coat, and fuzz layers. A special-case mode for rendering thin-walled objects is also described.
  Additional sections explore technical topics in greater depth, such as the decoupling of specular reflectivity from transmission, the choice of parameterization for subsurface scattering, and the detailed physics of coat darkening and thin-film interference. We also discuss planned extensions, including hazy specular reflection and retroreflection.</description>

      <title>Topology-Preserving Scalar Field Optimization for Boundary-Conforming Spiral Toolpaths on Multiply Connected Freeform Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ball-end milling path planning on multiply connected freeform surfaces is pivotal for high-quality and efficient machining of components in automotive and aerospace manufacturing. Although scalar-field-based optimization provides a unified framework for multi-objective toolpath generation, maintaining boundary conformity while eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching or termination and disrupt toolpath continuity remains challenging on multiply connected surfaces. We propose an efficient strategy to robustly enforce these constraints throughout optimization. Conformal slit mapping is employed to construct a feasible, singularity-free initial scalar field. The optimization is reformulated as a topology-preserving mesh deformation governed by boundary-synchronous updates, enabling globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions. Consequently, the toolpaths are continuous, boundary-conforming, and free of self-intersections. Milling experiments demonstrate that, compared with a state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping-based method, the proposed approach increases machining efficiency by 14.24%, improves scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces milling impact-induced vibrations by over 10%. The strategy offers broad applicability in high-performance machining scenarios.</description>

      <title>ByteLoom: Weaving Geometry-Consistent Human-Object Interactions through Progressive Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.</description>

      <title>Domain matters: Towards domain-informed evaluation for link prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction, a foundational task in complex network analysis, has extensive applications in critical scenarios such as social recommendation, drug target discovery, and knowledge graph completion. However, existing evaluations of algorithmic often rely on experiments conducted on a limited number of networks, assuming consistent performance rankings across domains. Despite the significant disparities in generative mechanisms and semantic contexts, previous studies often improperly highlight ``universally optimal" algorithms based solely on naive average over networks across domains. This paper systematically evaluates 12 mainstream link prediction algorithms across 740 real-world networks spanning seven domains. We present substantial empirical evidence elucidating the performance of algorithms in specific domains. This findings reveal a notably low degree of consistency in inter-domain algorithm rankings, a phenomenon that stands in stark contrast to the high degree of consistency observed within individual domains. Principal Component Analysis shows that response vectors formed by the rankings of the 12 algorithms cluster distinctly by domain in low-dimensional space, thus confirming domain attributes as a pivotal factor affecting algorithm performance. We propose a metric called Winner Score that could identify the superior algorithm in each domain: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for social networks, Neighborhood Overlap-aware Graph Neural Networks for economics, Graph Convolutional Networks for chemistry, and L3-based Resource Allocation for biology. However, these domain-specific top-performing algorithms tend to exhibit suboptimal performance in other domains. This finding underscores the importance of aligning an algorithm's mechanism with the network structure.</description>

      <title>HY-Motion 1.0: Scaling Flow Matching Models for Text-To-Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HY-Motion 1.0, a series of state-of-the-art, large-scale, motion generation models capable of generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions. HY-Motion 1.0 represents the first successful attempt to scale up Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based flow matching models to the billion-parameter scale within the motion generation domain, delivering instruction-following capabilities that significantly outperform current open-source benchmarks. Uniquely, we introduce a comprehensive, full-stage training paradigm -- including large-scale pretraining on over 3,000 hours of motion data, high-quality fine-tuning on 400 hours of curated data, and reinforcement learning from both human feedback and reward models -- to ensure precise alignment with the text instruction and high motion quality. This framework is supported by our meticulous data processing pipeline, which performs rigorous motion cleaning and captioning. Consequently, our model achieves the most extensive coverage, spanning over 200 motion categories across 6 major classes. We release HY-Motion 1.0 to the open-source community to foster future research and accelerate the transition of 3D human motion generation models towards commercial maturity.</description>

      <title>CraftMesh: High-Fidelity Generative Mesh Manipulation via Poisson Seamless Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controllable, high-fidelity mesh editing remains a significant challenge in 3D content creation. Existing generative methods often struggle with complex geometries and fail to produce detailed results. We propose CraftMesh, a novel framework for high-fidelity generative mesh manipulation via Poisson Seamless Fusion. Our key insight is to decompose mesh editing into a pipeline that leverages the strengths of 2D and 3D generative models: we edit a 2D reference image, then generate a region-specific 3D mesh, and seamlessly fuse it into the original model. We introduce two core techniques: Poisson Geometric Fusion, which utilizes a hybrid SDF/Mesh representation with normal blending to achieve harmonious geometric integration, and Poisson Texture Harmonization for visually consistent texture blending. Experimental results demonstrate that CraftMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior global consistency and local detail in complex editing tasks.</description>
