      <title>On the extinction phase of the contact process with an asymptomatic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact process with an asymptomatic state, introduced in [Belhadji, Lanchier and Mercer, Stochastic Process. Appl., 176:104417, 2024], is a natural variant of the basic contact process that distinguishes between asymptomatic (state 1) and symptomatic (state 2) individuals. Infected individuals infect their healthy neighbors at rate $\lambda_1$ when asymptomatic and at rate $\lambda_2$ when symptomatic. Newly infected individuals are always asymptomatic and become symptomatic at rate $\gamma$, and infected individuals recover at rate one regardless of whether they are asymptomatic or symptomatic. Belhadji, Lanchier and Mercer proved that, in the mean-field approximation, there is an epidemic if and only if $\lambda_1 + \gamma \lambda_2 &gt; 1 + \gamma$, showing in particular that, for all $\gamma &gt; 0$, there is an epidemic for $\lambda_2$ sufficiently large. In contrast, comparing the process with a subcritical Galton-Watson branching process, they proved for the spatial model that, if $\gamma &lt; 1 / (4d - 1)$ and $\lambda_1 = 0$, then there is no epidemic even in the limiting case $\lambda_2 = \infty$. In this paper, we prove an exponential decay of the progeny of the Galton-Watson branching process, and use a block construction and a perturbation argument, to extend the extinction phase of the process to $\lambda_1 &gt; 0$ small.</description>

      <title>Weingarten calculus with virtual isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the Weingarten calculus employing the notion of virtual isometries. Traditionally, Weingarten calculus provides explicit formulas for integrating polynomial functions over compact matrix groups with respect to the Haar measure, yet faces limitations when evaluating high-degree integrals due to the non-invertibility of the associated matrices. We revisit these classical computations from a new perspective: by constructing Haar-distributed matrices via sequences of complex reflections, we derive new recursive structures for the Weingarten functions across different dimensions. This framework leads to two main results: (1) an explicit Weingarten calculus for complex reflections, yielding systematic moment computations for associated rank-one matrices, and (2) a novel convolution formula that connects Weingarten functions in dimension $n$ to those in dimension $n-1$ through the introduction of ascension functions in the symmetric group algebra. Our approach not only provides a unified treatment for unitary groups, but also sheds light on the algebraic and probabilistic aspects of high-degree integral computations. Several examples and applications are presented.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for jump processes depending on fast ergodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a slow-fast stochastic process where the slow component is a jump process on a measurable index set whose transition rates depend on the position of the fast component. Between the jumps, the fast component evolves according to an ergodic dynamic in a state space determined by the index process. We prove that, when the ergodic dynamics are accelerated, the slow index process converges to an autonomous pure jump process on the index set. We apply our results to prove the convergence of a typed branching process toward a continuous-time Galton-Watson process, and of an epidemic model with fast viral loads dynamics to a standard contact process.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of adapted solutions to scalar BSDEs with Peano-type generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) with a Peano-type generator, is known to have infinitely many solutions when the terminal value is vanishing, and is shown to have possibly multiple solutions even when the terminal value is not vanishing but nonnegative. In this paper, we study the uniqueness of adapted solutions of such a BSDE when the terminal value is almost surely positive. Two methods are developed. The first one is to connect the BSDE to an optimal stochastic control problem: under suitable integrability of the terminal values, with a verification argument, we prove that the first component of the adapted solution pair is the value process for the optimal stochastic control problem. The second one appeals to a change of variables, and is more inclined to analysis: by a change of variables, the original BSDE is reduced to a convex quadratic BSDE, and then using the $\theta$-difference method, we give a sharp result in some special case, which includes the BSDE governing the well-known Kreps-Porteus utility.</description>

      <title>Saddle Point Approximation and Central Limit Theorem for Densities in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the saddlepoint approximation (SPA) for sums of $n$ i.i.d. random vectors $X_i\in\mathbb R^d$ in growing dimensions. SPA provides highly accurate approximations to probability densities and distribution functions via the moment generating function. Recent work by Tang and Reid extended SPA to cases where the dimension $d$ increases with $n$, obtaining an error rate of order $O(d^3/n)$. We refine this analysis and improve the SPA error rate to $O(d^2/n)$. We obtain a non-asymptotic bound for the multiplicative SPA error. As a corollary, we establish the first local central limit theorem for densities in growing dimensions, under the condition $d^2/n \to 0$, and provide explicit multiplicative error bounds. An example involving Gaussian mixtures illustrates our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a stochastic control approach we establish couplings of the Liouville field and the sinh-Gordon field with the Gaussian free field in dimension $d=2$, such that the difference is in a Sobolev space of regularity $\alpha&gt;1$. The analysis covers the entire $L^2$ phase. Our main tools are estimates for the short scales of the minimiser of the variational problem and several applications of the Brascamp-Lieb inequality.</description>

      <title>One-arm exponents of high-dimensional percolation revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider sufficiently spread-out Bernoulli percolation in dimensions ${d&gt;6}$. We present a short and simple proof of the up-to-constants estimate for the one-arm probability in both the full-space and half-space settings. These results were previously established by Kozma and Nachmias and by Chatterjee and Hanson, respectively. Our proof improves upon the entropic technique introduced by Dewan and Muirhead, relying on a sharp estimate on a suitably chosen correlation length recently obtained by Duminil-Copin and Panis. This approach is inspired by our companion work, where we compute the one-arm exponent for several percolation models related to the high-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation for Extreme Points in Laguerre tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider three particular models of Poisson-Laguerre tessellations, namely, $\beta$-, $\beta'$- and Gaussian-Voronoi tessellations. The tessellations are constructed based on inhomogeneous Poisson point processes in space-time $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}$, where some of the points of the process give rise to a cell in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (extreme points), while the others produce an empty cell. Using the notion of region-stabilization, we derive quantitative central limit theorems with presumably optimal rates of convergence for the number of extreme points of $\beta$-, $\beta'$- and Gaussian-Voronoi tessellations in a growing window $W_n=[-n,n]^d$ as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Exponential Convergence Guarantees for Iterative Markovian Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations like Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical guarantees for DSBM.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics of Heavy-Tailed SGDs in Nonconvex Loss Landscape: Characterization and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Limiting Spectral Distribution of High-dimensional Multivariate Kendall-$\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multivariate Kendall-$\tau$ statistic, denoted by $K_n$, plays a significant role in robust statistical analysis. This paper establishes the limiting properties of the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $K_n$. We demonstrate that the ESD of $\frac{1}{2}pK_n$ converges almost surely to the Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur law with variance parameter $\frac{1}{2}$, analogous to the classical result for sample covariance matrices.
  Using Stieltjes transform techniques, we extend these results to the independent component model, deriving a fixed-point equation that characterizes the limiting spectral distribution of $\frac{1}{2}tr\Sigma K_n$. The theoretical findings are validated through comprehensive simulation studies.</description>

Abstract: We prove general upper estimates for the distance between two Borel probability measures in Wasserstein metric in terms of the Fourier transforms of the measures. We work in compact manifolds including the torus, the Euclidean unit sphere, compact Lie groups and compact homogeneous spaces, and treat the Wasserstein metric $W_p$ in the full range $1 \le p \le \infty$ for the first time. The proofs are based on a comparison between the Wasserstein metric and a dual Sobolev norm, Riesz transform estimates and Hausdorff--Young inequalities on compact manifolds. As an application, we show that spherical designs are optimally close to the uniform measure on the sphere in Wasserstein metric.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard scheme for solving high-dimensional drift control problems with state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to the dynamic control of queueing networks, we develop a simulation-based scheme, the so-called multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation, for solving high-dimensional drift control problems whose states are constrained to stay within the nonnegative orthant, over a finite time horizon. We prove that under suitable conditions, the MLP approximation overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the following sense: To approximate the value function and its gradient evaluated at a given time and state to within a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$, the computational complexity grows at most polynomially in the problem dimension $d$ and $1/\varepsilon$. To illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme, we carry out numerical experiments for a class of test problems that are related to the dynamic scheduling problem of parallel server systems in heavy traffic, and demonstrate that the scheme is computationally feasible up to dimension at least $20$.</description>

      <title>Beyond Poisson: First-Passage Asymptotics of Renewal Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) of a stochastic signal to a threshold is a fundamental observable across physics, biology, and finance. While renewal shot noise is a canonical model for such signals, analytical results for its FPT have remained confined to the Poisson (Markovian) case, despite the prevalence of non-Poisson arrival statistics in applications from neuronal spiking to gene expression. We break this long-standing barrier by deriving the first universal asymptotic formula for the mean FPT $\langle T_b \rangle$ to reach level $b$ for renewal shot noise with general arrival statistics and exponential marks. Our central result is a closed-form expression that reveals precisely how general inter-arrival statistics impact the naive Arrhenius law. We show that the short-time behavior of the interarrival distribution dictates universal scaling corrections, ranging from stretched-exponential to algebraic, that can dramatically accelerate threshold crossing. Furthermore, we argue and confirm numerically that the full FPT distribution becomes exponential at large thresholds, implying that $\langle T_b \rangle$ provides a complete asymptotic characterization. Our work, enabled by a novel exact solution for the moments of the noise, establishes a general framework for analyzing extreme events in non-Markovian systems with relaxation.</description>

Abstract: In [arXiv:1701.00018, arXiv:2107.07984] an explicit biorthogonalization method was developed that applies to a class of determinantal measures which describe the evolution of several variants of classical interacting particle systems in the KPZ universality class. The method leads to explicit Fredholm determinant formulas for the multipoint distributions of these systems which are suitable for asymptotic analysis. In this paper we extend the method to a broader class of determinantal measures which is applicable to systems where particles have different jump speeds and different memory lengths. As an application of our results we study three particular examples: some variants of TASEP with two blocks of particles having different speeds, a version of discrete time TASEP which mixes particles with sequential and parallel update, and a version of sequential TASEP with a block of long memory particles placed at the bulk of the system.</description>

      <title>The Brownian Spatial Coalescent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Brownian spatial coalescent, a class of Markov spatial coalescent processes on the $d$-dimensional torus in continuous space, that is axiomatically defined by the following property: conditional on the times and locations of all coalescence events, lineages follow independent Brownian bridges backwards in time along the branches of the coalescence tree. We prove that a Brownian spatial coalescent is characterised by a set of finite "transition measures" on the torus, in analogy to the transition rates that characterise a non-spatial coalescent.
  We prove that a Brownian spatial coalescent is sampling consistent, in a novel sense, if and only if all transition measures are constant multiples of Lebesgue measure, and the multiples are the transition rates of a $\Xi$-coalescent, or a $\Lambda$-coalescent if simultaneous mergers are not allowed. This defines the "Brownian spatial $\Xi$-coalescent", which we prove describes the genealogies of the $\Xi$-Fleming-Viot process - a generalisation of the well known Fleming-Viot process - at stationarity, and in fact describes its full time reversal if augmented with "resampling" steps at the times of coalescence events.
  An important consequence of our results is that all spatial population models in which individuals follow independent Brownian motions and the branching mechanism depends non-trivially on the spatial distribution, for example through local regulation, have non-Markovian genealogies.
  Byproducts of our results include explicit formulas for samples from the stationary distribution of a $\Xi$-Fleming-Viot process, Wright-Malecot type formulas, and a representation of the backward dynamics of lineages in terms of Brownian motions with coupled drift. This includes calculations of the drift that leads to multiple or even simultaneous mergers in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Maximal Inequalities for Empirical Processes under General Mixing Conditions with an Application to Strong Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a bound for the supremum of sample averages over a class of functions for a general class of mixing stochastic processes with arbitrary mixing rates. Regardless of the speed of mixing, the bound is comprised of a concentration rate and a novel measure of complexity. The speed of mixing, however, affects the former quantity implying a phase transition. Fast mixing leads to the standard root-n concentration rate, while slow mixing leads to a slower concentration rate, its speed depends on the mixing structure. Our findings are applied to obtain new Glivenko-Cantelli type results and to derive strong approximation results for a general class of mixing processes with arbitrary mixing rates.</description>

      <title>Glauber dynamics and coupling-from-the-past for Gaussian fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the representation of stationary Gaussian Markov random fields as factors of i.i.d. processes, with a focus on their approximation by finitely dependent distributions. Our model is a Gaussian field on $\mathbf{Z}^d$ such that the conditional law of the field at any site is Gaussian of mean $\varepsilon$ times the average of its neighbours, and of variance 1. Building on coupling-from-the-past (CFTP) techniques, we prove that for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$, the distribution of the field can be written as an explicit factor of an i.i.d. process. Furthermore, we construct approximations by finitely dependent fields that are close in total variation to the original field, with exponential decay when the allowed range of dependence grows. We first do the proof for a truncated version of this Gaussian model, showing in this case that the associated field admits a finitary coding with exponential tails, providing a new application of high-noise condition of H\"aggstr\"om and Steif \cite{HaggstromSteif} for an uncountable state space. The proof for the original model is more intricate. Our approach extends classical CFTP-based constructions by developing a stratified coupling method tailored to the continuous and unbounded nature of the Gaussian setting.</description>

      <title>The probability of almost all eigenvalues being real for the elliptic real Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the parameter of asymmetry $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form \begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &amp;\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &amp;\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*} and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with the strong Szeg\H{o} limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Singularities for the Damped Stochastic Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the $1+1$ dimensional damped stochastic Klein-Gordon equation, we show that random singularities associated with the law of the iterated logarithm exist and propogate in the same way as the stochastic wave equation. This provides evidence for possible connections to microlocal analysis, ie. the exact regularity and singularities described in this paper should admit wavefront set type descriptions whose propagation is determined by the highest order terms of the linear operator. Despite the results being exactly the same as those of the wave equation, our proofs are significantly different than the proofs for the wave equation. Miraculously, proving our results for the critically damped equation implies them for the general equation, which significantly simplifies the problem. Even after this simplification, many important parts of the proof are significantly different than (and we think are more intuitive from the PDE viewpoint compared to) existing proofs for the wave equation.</description>

      <title>A Brenier Theorem on $(P_2 (...P_2(H)...), W_2 )$ and Applications to Adapted Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop Brenier theorems on iterated Wasserstein spaces. For a separable Hilbert space $H$ and $N\geq 1$, we construct a full-support probability $\Lambda$ on $P_2^{N}(H)= P_2(... P_2(H)...)$ that is transport regular: for every $Q$ with finite second moment, transporting $\Lambda$ to $Q$ with cost $W_2^2$ admits a unique optimizer, and this optimizer is of Monge type. The analysis rests on a characterization of optimal couplings on $P_2(H)$ and, more generally, on $P_2^{N}(H)$ via convex potentials on the Lions lift; in the latter case we employ a new adapted version of the lift tailored to the $N$-step structure. A key idea is a new identification between optimal-transport $c$-conjugation (with $c$ given by maximal covariance) and classical convex conjugation on the lift.
  A primary motivation comes from the adapted Wasserstein distance $AW_2$: our results yield a first Brenier theorem for $AW_2$ and characterize $AW_2^2$-optimal couplings through convex functionals on the space of $L_2$-processes.</description>

      <title>The Low-Degree Hardness of Finding Large Independent Sets in Sparse Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of finding large independent sets in Erdos-Renyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices having average degree $d$. Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virag, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap holds for this problem.
  Additionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining $r$-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is $r$-partite if there is a partition $V=V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_r$ such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set $V_i$. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random $r$-partite hypergraphs with $n$ vertices in each partition and average degree $d$. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ asymptotically. Furthermore, we prove an analogous low-degree computational threshold of $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs.
  While the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-1 polynomial.</description>

      <title>A uniform-in-time nonlocal approximation of the standard Fokker-Planck equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation in which we can estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium in a way which does not degenerate as we approach the local limit of the equation. This uniform estimate cannot be easily obtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained through the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative versions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can prove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of the usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time-hence we show the approximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated equilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also study.</description>

      <title>Bounded-confidence opinion models with random-time interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, agents interact with each other and can change their opinions as a result of those interactions. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if their opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, researchers typically assume that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social interactions, and it is desirable to account for it. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social-interaction event times, which can follow arbitrary interevent-time distributions (ITDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We analyze the quantitative impact of ITDs on the transient dynamics of BCMs and derive approximate master equations for the time-dependent expectations of the BCM dynamics. We find that BCMs with Markovian ITDs have consistent statistical properties (in particular, they have the same expected time-dependent opinions) when the ITDs have the same mean but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian ITDs depend on the type of ITD even when the ITDs have the same mean. Additionally, we numerically examine the transient and steady-state dynamics of our models with various ITDs on different networks and compare their expected order-parameter values and expected convergence times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the statistics of collisions among locally confined gas particles poses a major challenge. In this work we investigate $\mathbb Z^d$-map lattices coupled by collision with simplified local dynamics that offer significant insights for the above challenging problem. We obtain a first order approximation for the first collision rate at a site $\textbf{p}^*\in \mathbb Z^d$ and we prove a distributional convergence for the first collision time to an exponential, with sharp error term. Moreover, we prove that the number of collisions at site $\textbf{p}^*$ converge in distribution to a compound Poisson distributed random variable. Key to our analysis in this infinite dimensional setting is the use of transfer operators associated with the decoupled map lattice at site $\textbf{p}^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r&gt;1$, a random $2r$--regular Schreier graph associated with the action of $r$ uniformly random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ has a near--optimal spectral gap with high probability, provided $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{20}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random permutations in irreducible representations of quasi--exponential dimension.
  Along the way, we give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(\frac{1}{\dim\chi^{\mu}}\right)=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Lyapunov method for fully heterogeneous weakly-coupled MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06072v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, an efficiently computable policy achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our main technical innovation is the construction of projection-based Lyapunov functions that certify the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region, even under full heterogeneity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that the Dirichlet $L$-functions $L(1/2+ix,\chi_q)$, where $\chi_q$ is uniformly random Dirichlet character modulo $q$ and $x\in \mathbb{R}$, converges to a random Schwartz distribution $\zeta_{\mathrm{rand}}$, which is related to (complex) Gaussian multiplicative chaos. This is the same limiting object that appeared in [34], where the authors proved that the random shifts of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line $\zeta(1/2+ix+i\omega T)$, where $\omega\sim \mathrm{Unif} ([0,1])$, converge as $T\to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: Reliable inference from complex survey samples can be derailed by outliers and high-leverage observations induced by unequal inclusion probabilities and calibration. We develop a minimum Hellinger distance estimator (MHDE) for parametric superpopulation models under complex designs, including Poisson PPS and fixed-size SRS/PPS without replacement, with possibly stochastic post-stratified or calibrated weights. Using a Horvitz-Thompson-adjusted kernel density plug-in, we show: (i) $L^1$-consistency of the KDE with explicit large-deviation tail bounds driven by a variance-adaptive effective sample size; (ii) uniform exponential bounds for the Hellinger affinity that yield MHDE consistency under mild identifiability; (iii) an asymptotic Normal distribution for the MHDE with covariance $\mathbf A^{-1}\boldsymbol\Sigma \mathbf A^{\intercal}$ (and a finite-population correction under without-replacement designs); and (iv) robustness via the influence function and $\alpha$-influence curves in the Hellinger topology. Simulations under Gamma and lognormal superpopulation models quantify efficiency-robustness trade-offs relative to weighted MLE under independent and high-leverage contamination. An application to NHANES 2021-2023 total water consumption shows that the MHDE remains stable despite extreme responses that markedly bias the MLE. The estimator is simple to implement via quadrature over a fixed grid and is extensible to other divergence families.</description>
