      <title>SIRIUS: Identifying Metal-poor Stars Enriched by a Single Supernova in a Star-by-star Cosmological Zoom-in Simulation of a Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-poor stars enriched by a single supernova (mono-enriched stars) are direct proof (and provide valuable probes) of supernova nucleosynthesis. Photometric and spectroscopic observations have shown that metal-poor stars have a wide variety of chemical compositions; the star's chemical composition reflects the nucleosynthesis process(es) that occurred before the star's formation. While the identification of mono-enriched stars enables us to study the ejecta properties of a single supernova, the fraction of mono-enriched stars among metal-poor stars remains unknown. Here we identify mono-enriched stars in a star-by-star cosmological zoom-in simulation of a dwarf galaxy. We find that the fraction of mono-enriched stars is higher for lower metallicity, stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -2.5$. The percentages of mono-enriched stars are 11% at [Fe/H] = $-$5.0 and 1% at [Fe/H] = $-$2.5, suggesting that most metal-poor stars are affected by multiple supernovae. We also find that mono-enriched stars tend to be located near the center of the simulated dwarf. Such regions will be explored in detail in upcoming surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) on the Subaru telescope.</description>

      <title>Dense Molecular gas and Dusty Torus in NGC 4303</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum analysis at 3 mm of the central region ($r\sim$800 pc) of NGC\,4303 showed molecular gas lines of both dense gas tracers (HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, and C$_2$H) and diffuse gases ($^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O). Molecular gas derived parameters: $H_2$ mass $M_{H_2}$=(1.75$\pm$0.32)$\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$; radial velocity, V$_{dense}=$178$\pm$60 km\,s$^{-1}$, and V$_{CO}=$151$\pm$29 km\,s$^{-1}$; HCN luminosity $L_{HCN}$=(7.38$\pm$1.40)$\times10^{6}\,\,K\,\,km\,\,s^{-1}\,pc^{2}$; dense gas mass $M_{dense}$=(4.7$\pm$0.3) $\times 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, and dense gas tracers abundances indicating that dense gas contributes significantly to the total molecular gas mass. To explore the AGN nature and central dusty torus of the galaxy, CIGALE was used to fit the integrated spectral energy distribution from submillimeter to UV frequencies. Large torus properties are estimated: luminosity $L_{TORUS}$\,=\,(7.1$\pm$2.8) $\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and line of sight inclination of 67$\pm$16$^\circ$, which is consistent with a Type 2 AGN; total infrared luminosity $L_{IR}$=(3.51$\,\pm$\,0.30)$\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$; star formation rate $SFR$=6.0$\pm$0.3 M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$; and found that the AGN contribution is marginal at $\sim$20\%.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). VII. The 20-214 $\mu$m imaging atlas of active galactic nuclei using SOFIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 19.7 - 214 $\mu$m imaging atlas of local (4 - 181 Mpc; median 43 Mpc) active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed with FORCAST and HAWC+ on board the SOFIA telescope with angular resolutions ~ 3"- 20". This atlas comprises 22 Seyferts (17 Type 2 and 5 Type 1) with a total of 69 images, 41 of which have not been previously published. The AGN span a range of luminosities of log$_{10}$ ($L_{bol}$ [erg/s]) = [42, 46] with a median of log$_{10}$ ($L_{bol}$ [erg/s]) = 44.1 $\pm$ 1.0. We provide total fluxes of our sample using aperture photometry for point source objects and a 2-D Gaussian fitting for objects with extended host galaxy emission, which was used to estimate the unresolved nuclear component. Most galaxies in our sample are point-like sources, however, four sources (Centaurus A, Circinus, NGC 1068, and NGC 4388) show extended emission in all wavelengths. The 30 - 40 $\mu$m extended emission in NGC 4388 is coincident with the narrow line region at PA ~ 50$^{\circ}$, while the dusty extension at longer wavelengths arises from the host galaxy at PA ~ 90$^{\circ}$. Our new observations allow us to construct the best sampled spectral energy distributions (SEDs) available between 30 - 500 $\mu$m for a sample of nearby AGN. We estimate that the average peak wavelength of the nuclear SEDs is ~ 40 $\mu$m in $\nu$F$_{\nu}$ , which we associate with an unresolved extended dusty region heated by the AGN.</description>

      <title>Stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of about 5 million stars from S-PLUS multi-band photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Spectroscopic surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST have significantly advanced our understanding of the Milky Way by providing extensive stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Complementing these, photometric surveys with narrow/medium-band filters, such as the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), offer the potential to estimate stellar parameters and abundances for a much larger number of stars.
  Aims. This work develops methodologies to extract stellar atmospheric parameters and selected chemical abundances from S-PLUS photometric data, which spans ~3000 square degrees using seven narrowband and five broadband filters.
  Methods. Using 66 S-PLUS colors, we estimated parameters based on training samples from LAMOST, APOGEE, and GALAH, applying Cost-Sensitive Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forests (RF). We tested for spurious correlations by including abundances not covered by the S-PLUS filters and evaluated NN and RF performance, with NN consistently outperforming RF. Including Teff and log g as features improved accuracy by ~3%. We retained only parameters with a goodness-of-fit above 50%.
  Results. Our approach provides reliable estimates of fundamental parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) and abundance ratios such as [{\alpha}/Fe], [Al/Fe], [C/Fe], [Li/Fe], and [Mg/Fe] for ~5 million stars, with goodness-of-fit &gt;60%. Additional ratios like [Cu/Fe], [O/Fe], and [Si/Fe] were derived but are less accurate. Validation using star clusters, TESS, and J-PLUS data confirmed the robustness of our methodology.
  Conclusions. By leveraging S-PLUS photometry and machine learning, we present a cost-effective alternative to high-resolution spectroscopy for deriving stellar parameters and abundances, enabling insights into Milky Way stellar populations and supporting future classification efforts.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Properties of Infrared-Faint Radio Sources Based on Spectral Energy Distribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared-faint radio sources (IFRSs) are believed to be a rare class of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RL AGN) characterized by their high radio-to-infrared flux density ratios of up to several thousands. Previous studies have shown that a fraction of IFRSs are likely to be hosted in dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs). In this paper, our aim was to probe the dust properties, star formation rate (SFR), and AGN activity of IFRSs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of 20 IFRSs with spectroscopic redshifts ranging from 1.2 to 3.7. We compare the Bayesian evidence of a three-component model (stellar, AGN and cold dust) with that of a two-component model (stellar and cold dust) for six IFRSs in our sample with far-infrared (FIR) photometry and find that the three-component model has significantly higher Bayesian evidence, suggesting that IFRSs are most likely to be AGN. The median SED of our IFRS sample shows similarities to AGN-starburst composite in the IR regime. The derived IR luminosities of IFRSs indicate that they are low-luminosity counterparts of high-redshift radio galaxies. We disentangle the contributions of AGN-heated and star-formation-heated dust to the IR luminosity of IFRSs and find that our sample is likely AGN-dominated. However, despite the evidence for significant impact of AGN on the host galaxy, the AGN luminosity of our sample does not show correlation with the SFR of the sources.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>A Short-lived Rejuvenation during the Decades-long Changing-look Transition in the Nucleus of Mrk 1018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs), characterized by emerging or disappearing of broad lines accompanied with extreme continuum flux variability, have drawn much attention for their potential of revealing physical processes underlying AGN evolution. We perform seven-season spectroscopic monitoring on Mrk~1018, one of the earliest identified CL-AGN. Around 2020, we detect a full-cycle changing-look transition of Mrk~1018 within one year, associated with a nucleus outburst, which likely arise from the disk instability in the transition region between the outer standard rotation-dominated disk and inner advection-dominated accretion flow. Over the past forty-five years, the accretion rate of Mrk~1018 changed 1000 times and the maximum Eddington ratio reached 0.02. By investigating the relation between broad-line properties and Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$), we find strong evidence that the full-cycle type transition is regulated by accretion. There exists a turnover point in the Balmer decrement, which is observed for the first time. The broad Balmer lines change from a single peak in Type 1.0-1.2 to double peaks in Type 1.5-1.8 and the double-peak separation decreases with increasing accretion rate. We also find that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the broad Balmer lines obeys FWHM$\propto (L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd})^{-0.27}$, as expected for a virialized BLR. The velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm line}$ follows a similar trend in Type 1.5-1.8, but displays a sharp increases in Type 1.0-1.2, resulting in a dramatic drop of FWHM/$\sigma_{\rm line}$. These findings suggest that a virialized BLR together with accretion-dependent turbulent motions might be responsible for the diversity of BLR phenomena across AGN population.</description>

      <title>A Wide and Deep Exploration of Radio Galaxies with Subaru HSC (WERGS). X. The Massive and Passive Nature of Radio Galaxies at $z \sim 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-$z$ radio galaxies (HzRGs) are considered important objects for understanding the formation and evolution of massive galaxies in the early universe. However, till date, detailed studies of the stellar population of HzRGs such as the star-formation history have been scarce. Therefore, this study conducted a new survey to establish a less-biased sample of HzRGs and consequently investigate their properties. We utilized a sample of $g$-dropout Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) obtained from an optical wide and deep imaging survey made by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). Based on the cross-matching of this LBG sample with the VLA FIRST radio survey data, we constructed a photometric sample of high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) at $z \sim 4$ for $\sim$560 deg$^2$ survey field. Consequently, we identified 146 HzRG candidates. To analyze the characteristics of these candidates, we focus on objects exhibiting the near-infrared photometry of VIKING or UKIDSS and the mid-infrared photometry of unWISE (28 objects). The results indicate that 7 objects exhibit SEDs consistent with galaxies at $z \sim 4$. The HzRG candidates have very large stellar masses with $\sim 4.2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ on average. This stellar mass is similar to that of previously discovered USS HzRGs at $z \sim 4$, though our sample is affected by a sample selection bias that selects only HzRGs with $M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. Further, the SEDs of those HzRG candidates suggest a past fast quenching with a rough timescale of $\sim$0.1 Gyr, as evidenced from the rest-frame UVJ diagram.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the Hercules group: I. chemical signatures indicating the outer bar origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hercules kinematic group is a kinematic anomaly of stars observed in the solar neighbourhood (SNd). In this series of papers, we present a comprehensive study of this structure. This paper focuses on its chemical signatures over several groups of elements. The next paper discusses its kinematical properties. While studies suggested a non-native origin of Hercules stars due to the distinct chemical and kinematic features, previous studies focussed mainly on the Fe abundances. We adopt chemical data with abundances of elements from APOGEE and GALAH to seek further chemical evidence of the origin. Our analysis reveals that the low alpha population of the low angular momentum Hercules group is significantly enhanced in iron-peak (Fe, Ni, Mn) and odd-Z (Na, Al) elements, and slightly deficient in alpha elements (O, Ca, Ti) compared to kinematically local stars. The super enhancement in iron-peak elements and deficiency in alpha elements support their origin from the outer thin bar in the inner Galaxy. Moreover, the enhancement in Na and Al indicates these stars as the youngest stars in the old sequence from the inner thick disc. Hence, the origin of these stars can be related to the outer bar region. These chemical signatures require the underlying dynamical mechanism that forms the Hercules group to be capable of transporting stars in the inner Galaxy out to the SNd. The next paper will consider the Trojan orbits as the favoured mechanism.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the Hercules group: II. the Trojan quasi-periodic identity on the orbital level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hercules structure is a stellar kinematic group anomaly observed in the solar neighbourhood (SNd). In the previous paper, we analysed chemical signatures and related the origin of this stellar population to the outer bar. Next to consider is how this alien population migrate out into the SNd. Often, the formation of this kinematic structure is associated with bar resonances. In this paper, We consider the driving mechanism of Hercules on the orbital level. We construct a simple Milky Way-like potential model with a slowly rotating long bar and explore some of the stellar orbit families and their stability. With this model, our numerical solutions of the equations of motion show that extended quasi-periodic orbits trapped around fast-rotating periodic orbits around the L4 Lagrange point of the bar minor axis can pass through the SNd. When observed in the SNd, they populate the Hercules structure in the Lz-Vr kinematics space. Moreover, the variation in radial coverage in the galactic plane with the SNd kinematics shows good agreement with chemical signatures found in Paper I. Furthermore, the effective potential shows the topology of a volcano, the rim of which limits most orbits to stay inside or outside. Trojan orbits are a stable orbit family that can transport inner Galactic stars out to the SNd. They can explain the stellar kinematics of the Hercules group, and provide a straightforward basis for its chemical properties (see Paper I). We support the view that Trojan orbits associated with the slowly rotating Galactic bar explain the Hercules structure observed in SNd.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Milky Way with Gaia XP spectra I: Systematic flux corrections and atmospheric parameters for 68 million stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia XP spectra for over two hundred million stars have great potential for mapping metallicity across the Milky Way. Several recent studies have analyzed this data set to derive parameters and characterize systematics in the fluxes. We aim to construct an alternative catalog of atmospheric parameters from Gaia XP spectra by fitting them with synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres, and provide corrections to the XP fluxes according to stellar colors, magnitudes, and extinction. We use GaiaXPy to obtain calibrated spectra and apply FERRE to match the corrected XP spectra with models and infer atmospheric parameters. We train a neural network using stars in APOGEE to predict flux corrections as a function of wavelength for each target. Based on the comparison with APOGEE parameters, we conclude that our estimated parameters have systematic errors and uncertainties in $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and [M/H] about $-38 \pm 167$ K, $0.05 \pm 0.40$ dex, and $-0.12 \pm 0.19$ dex, respectively, for stars in the range $4000 \le T_{\mathrm{eff}} \le 7000$ K. The corrected XP spectra show better agreement with both models and Hubble Space Telescope CALSPEC data. Our correction increases the precision of the relative spectrophotometry of the XP data from $3.2\% - 3.7\%$ to $1.2\% - 2.4\%$. Finally, we have built a catalog of atmospheric parameters for stars within $4000 \le T_{\mathrm{eff}} \le 7000$ K, comprising $68,394,431$ sources, along with a subset of $124,188$ stars with $\mathrm{[M/H]} \le -2.5$. Our results confirm that the Gaia XP flux calibrated spectra show systematic patterns as a function of wavelength that are tightly related to colors, magnitudes, and extinction. Our optimization algorithm can give us accurate atmospheric parameters of stars with a clear and direct link to models of stellar atmospheres, and can be used to efficiently search for extremely metal-poor stars.</description>

      <title>First detection of a deuterated molecule in a starburst environment within NGC 253</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterium was primarily created during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This fact, alongside its fractionation reactions resulting in enhanced abundances of deuterated molecules, means that these abundances can be used to better understand many processes within the interstellar medium (ISM), as well as its history. Previously, observations of deuterated molecules have been limited to the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds and (with respect to HD) to quasar absorption spectra. We present the first robust detection of a deuterated molecule in a starburst environment and, besides HD, the first one detected outside the Local Group. We therefore can constrain the deuterium fractionation, as observed by DCN. We observed the CMZ of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 covering multiple Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) with cloud scale observations ($\sim 30$ pc) using ALMA. Via the use of the \texttt{MADCUBA} package we were able to perform LTE analysis in order to obtain deuterium fractionation estimates. We detect DCN in the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 and estimate the deuterium fractionation (D/H ratio) of DCN within the GMCs of the CMZ of NGC 253. We find a range of $5 \times 10^{-4}$ to $10 \times 10^{-4}$, relatively similar to the values observed in warm Galactic star-forming regions. We also determine an upper limit of D/H of $8 \times 10^{-5}$ from DCO\plus within one region, closer to the cosmic value of D/H. Our observations of deuterated molecules within NGC 253 appear to be consistent with previous galactic studies of star forming regions. This implies that warmer gas temperatures increase the abundance of DCN relative to other deuterated species. This study also further expands the regions, particularly in the extragalactic domain, in which deuterated species have been detected.</description>

      <title>Unveiling AGN Outflows: [O iii] Outflow Detection Rates and Correlation with Low-Frequency Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host outflows which have the potential to alter the host galaxy's evolution (AGN feedback). These outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. Here we investigate the connection between low-frequency radio emission using the International LOFAR Telescope and [O III] $\lambda$5007 ionised gas outflows using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Deep Fields, we select 198 AGN with optical spectra, 115 of which are detected at 144 MHz, and investigate their low-frequency radio emission properties. The majority of our sample do not show a radio excess when considering radio luminosity - SFR relationship, and are therefore not driven by powerful jets. We extract the [O III] $\lambda$5007 kinematics and remove AGN luminosity dependencies by matching the radio detected and non-detected AGN in $L_{\mathrm{6\mu m}}$ and redshift. Using both spectral fitting and $W_{80}$ measurements, we find radio detected AGN have a higher outflow rate (67.2$\pm$3.4 percent) than the radio non-detected AGN (44.6$\pm$2.7 percent), indicating a connection between ionised outflows and the presence of radio emission. For spectra where there are two components of the [O III] emission line present, we normalise all spectra by the narrow component and find that the average broad component in radio detected AGN is enhanced compared to the radio non-detected AGN. This could be a sign of higher gas content, which is suggestive of a spatial relationship between [O III] outflows and radio emission in the form of either low-powered jets or shocks from AGN winds.</description>

      <title>Signatures of black hole seeding in the local Universe: Predictions from the BRAHMA cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first "seeds" of supermassive black holes (BHs) continue to be an outstanding puzzle, and it is currently unclear whether the imprints of early seed formation survive today. Here we examine the signatures of seeding in the local Universe using five $[18~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ BRAHMA simulation boxes run to $z=0$. They initialize $1.5\times10^5~M_{\odot}$ BHs using different seeding models. The first four boxes initialize BHs as heavy seeds using criteria that depend on dense &amp; metal-poor gas, Lyman-Werner radiation, gas spin, and environmental richness. The fifth box initializes BHs as descendants of lower mass seeds ($\sim10^3~M_{\odot}$) using a new stochastic seed model built in our previous work. We find that strong signatures of seeding survive in $\sim10^5-10^6~M_{\odot}$ local BHs hosted in $M_*\lesssim10^{9}~M_{\odot}$ dwarf galaxies. The signatures survive due to two reasons: 1) there is a substantial population of local $\sim10^5~M_{\odot}$ BHs that are ungrown relics of early seeds from $z\sim5-10$; 2) BH growth up to $\sim10^6~M_{\odot}$ is dominated by mergers all the way down to $z\sim0$. As the contribution from gas accretion increases, the signatures of seeding start to weaken in more massive $\gtrsim10^6~M_{\odot}$ BHs, and they eventually disappear for $\gtrsim10^7~M_{\odot}$ BHs. This is in contrast to high-z ($z\gtrsim5$) BH populations wherein the BH growth is fully merger dominated, which causes the seeding signatures to persist at least up to $\sim10^8~M_{\odot}$. The different seed models predict abundances of local $\sim10^6~M_{\odot}$ BHs ranging from $\sim0.01-0.05~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ with occupation fractions of $\sim20-100\%$ in $M_*\sim10^{9}~M_{\odot}$ galaxies. Our results highlight the potential for local $\sim10^5-10^6~M_{\odot}$ BH populations in dwarf galaxies to serve as a promising probe for BH seeding models.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the universal Initial Mass Function in binary star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar mass distribution in star-forming regions, stellar clusters and associations, the Initial Mass Function (IMF), appears to be invariant across different star-forming environments, and is consistent with the IMF observed in the Galactic field. Deviations from the field, or standard, IMF, if genuine, would be considered strong evidence for a different set of physics at play during the formation of stars in the birth region in question. We analyse N-body simulations of the evolution of spatially and kinematically substructured star-forming regions to identify the formation of binary star clusters, where two (sub)clusters which form from the same Giant Molecular Cloud orbit a common centre of mass. We then compare the mass distributions of stars in each of the subclusters and compare them to the standard IMF, which we use to draw the stellar masses in the star-forming region from which the binary cluster(s) form. In each binary cluster that forms, the mass distributions of stars in one subcluster deviates from the standard IMF, and drastically so when we apply similar mass resolution limits as for the observed binary clusters. Therefore, if a binary subcluster is observed to have an unusual IMF, this may simply be the result of dynamical evolution, rather than different physical conditions for star formation in these systems.</description>

      <title>Tracing the origins of galaxy lopsidedness across cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current studies of large-scale asymmetries (i.e. lopsidedness) in the stellar density distribution of disk galaxies have mainly focused on the local Universe. Recent observations have found a significant fraction (over 60%) of lopsided galaxies at high-redshift ($1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3$), which is significantly larger than the fraction (~30%) observed in the nearby Universe. We aim to understand whether the more widespread lopsidedness at high- than low-redshift can be associated to environmental mechanisms being more effective in producing lopsided perturbations at high-redshift. At each redshift between $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$, we independently select a sample of disk-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations. We then characterize lopsidedness in the disks of galaxies at each redshift, study the relevant mechanisms generating lopsidedness, as well as the correlation between such perturbation, the local environment and the galaxy internal properties as a function of redshift. Consistent with previous and new observational results, we find that: 1) simulations predict a significant fraction (~60%) of lopsided galaxies at high-redshift ($1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2$), 2) the fraction of lopsided galaxies, as well as the lopsided amplitude, decreases from high- to low-redshift, and 3) there is not a significant dependence of lopsidedness on the local environment, but there is a strong correlation between the lopsided amplitude and basic galaxies' structural properties at all redshift between $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$. This means that, independent of the mechanisms on-setting lopsidedness, galaxies with low central stellar mass density and more extended disks are more susceptible of developing strong lopsidedness. We find that both recent interactions with mass-ratio &gt;1:10 and gas accretion with subsequent star formation can produce lopsided perturbations at all redshift, but they are both significantly more effective at high-redshift.</description>

      <title>A Global Census of Metals in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global census of metals in the Universe and their evolution with cosmic time, synthesizing robust estimates of metals in stars, hot intra-cluster gas, and gaseous absorbers tracing neutral gas as well as ionized gas in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. We observe a 13-fold increase in the stellar metal mass density from z~2.5 to 0.7, over which time stars emerge as the most important metal reservoir at low redshifts, housing ~31% of the total expected metal density at z~0.1. Hot virialized intracluster/intragroup gas accounts for ~15% and 10% of metals at z~0.1 and 0.7, respectively. Using metallicity measurements from CCC, KODIAQ-Z, and HD-LLS surveys covering redshifts z&lt;1 to z~2-3.5 we investigate the global distribution of metals in extragalactic ionized gas as a function of HI column density. During the period from z~3 to z&lt;1, the global metal density of cool (T~10^{4-5} K) gas has doubled. However, the fractional contribution of the ionized gas to the total expected metal density decreased from ~20% at z~3 to ~4% at z&lt;1. The cosmic metal density of all gas phases has increased with cosmic time, reflecting an "inside-out" metal dispersion by feedback mechanisms and galactic outflows.</description>

      <title>ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions -- XIX. The origin of SiO emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of silicon monoxide (SiO) can be considered as a fingerprint of shock interaction. In this work, we use high-sensitivity observations of the SiO (2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (1-0) emission to investigate the broad and narrow SiO emission toward 146 massive star-forming regions in the ATOMS survey. We detected SiO emission in 136 regions and distinguished broad and narrow components across the extension of 118 sources (including 58 UC $H_{II}$ regions) with an average angular resolution of 2.5$^{\prime}$$^{\prime}$. The derived SiO luminosity ($L_{SiO}$) across the whole sample shows that the majority of $L_{SiO}$ (above 66$\%$) can be attributed to broad SiO, indicating its association with strong outflows. The comparison of the ALMA SiO images with the filamentary skeletons identified from H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and in the infrared data (at 4.5, 8, and 24 $mu$m), further confirms that most SiO emission originates from outflows. However, note that for nine sources in our sample, the observed SiO emission may be generated by expanding UC $H_{II}$ regions. There is a moderate positive correlation between the bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) and $L_{SiO}$ for both components (narrow and broad). The UC $H_{II}$ sources show a weaker positive correlation between $L_{bol}$ and $L_{SiO}$ and higher $L_{SiO}$ compared to the sources without UC $H_{II}$ regions. These results imply that the SiO emission from UC $H_{II}$ sources might be affected by UV-photochemistry induced by UC $H_{II}$ regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the radio properties of the recently found high-redshift population, we collected a sample of $919$ little red dots (LRDs) from the literature. By cross-matching their coordinates with the radio catalogues based on the first- and second-epoch observations of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey, we found no radio counterparts coinciding with any of the LRDs. To uncover possible sub-mJy level weak radio emission, we performed mean and median image stacking analyses of empty-field 'Quick Look' VLASS and FIRST image cutouts centred on the LRD positions. We found no radio emission above $3\sigma$ noise levels ($\sim11$ and $\sim18~\mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$ for the VLASS and FIRST maps, respectively) in either of the stacked images for the LRD sample, while the noise levels of the single-epoch images are comparable to those found earlier in the stacking of high-redshift radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The non-detection of radio emission in LRDs suggests these sources host weaker (or no) radio AGNs.</description>

      <title>Radio-loudness statistics of quasars from Quaia-VLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars are objects of high interest for applications in extragalactic astrophysics, cosmology, and astrometry. One of their useful qualities is owed to their relativistic jets: they can be radio-loud. However, the fraction of radio-loud vs. radio-quiet quasars is subject to ongoing investigations, where the statistical power is limited by the low number of known quasars with radio counterparts. In this analysis, we revisited the radio-loudness statistics of quasars by significantly expanding the pool of known sources. Our main goal was to create a new, value-added catalogue of quasars with information about their extinction-corrected magnitudes, radio flux density, possible contamination levels, and other data flags, besides their sky coordinates and photometric redshifts. We cross-matched the optical Quaia catalogue of about 1.3 million quasars (selected from the Gaia data set) with 1.9 million sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio catalogue. We explored different thresholds for the matching radius, balancing the completeness and purity of the resulting Quaia-VLASS catalogue, and found that 1.5 arc seconds is a sufficient choice. Our main finding is that the radio-loud fraction of quasars is in good agreement with previous works (&lt; 10%), and there is no significant large-scale pattern in radio-loudness across the sky. The exact estimate depends on the G-band magnitude limit, and we observed some weak trends with redshift and absolute optical magnitude, possibly indicating remnant systematic effects in our data sets. The cross-matched Quaia-VLASS catalogue with 43,650 sources is available to the public for future analyses. This latest census of QSOs with radio counterparts will facilitate further investigations of the dichotomy of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, and it may also support other lines of investigations using quasars in cosmology and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Are Stellar Embryos in Perseus Radio-Synchrotron Emitters? Statistical data analysis with Herschel and LOFAR paving the way for the SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are fundamental to the chemistry and physics of star-forming regions, influencing molecular gas ionization, mediating interactions with interstellar magnetic fields, and regulating star formation from the diffuse interstellar medium to the creation of stellar cores. The electronic GeV component of CRs is expected to produce non-thermal synchrotron radiation detectable at radio frequencies, yet such emissions from Galactic star-forming regions remain elusive. This study reports the first statistical attempt to detect synchrotron emission at 144 MHz using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) in the nearby Perseus molecular cloud (300 pc). By median-stacking 353 prestellar and 132 protostellar cores from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey and using LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) data (20" resolution), 18 protostellar and 5 prestellar radio candidates were initially identified. However, these were likely extragalactic contaminants within the Herschel catalog. Stacked analyses did not reveal significant radio counterparts for prestellar and protostellar cores, with upper limits of $5\, \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and $8\, \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively. Non-detections suggest strong extinction mechanisms like free-free absorption and the Razin-Tsytovich effect for protostellar cores. For prestellar cores, analytical magnetostatic-isothermal models constrain the maximum ordered magnetic-field strength to 100 $\mu$G. Future predictions suggest that Square Kilometre Array-Low (SKA-Low) arrays could detect this emission in 9 hours (AA*) or 4 hours (AA4), enabling more sensitive constraints on synchrotron radiation in star-forming cores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new observing windows on the distant universe. Among JWST's instruments, the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) offers the unique capability of imaging observations at wavelengths $\lambda &gt; 5\mu$m. This enables unique access to the rest frame near infra-red (NIR, $\lambda \ge 1$\mum) emission from galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;4$ and the visual ($\lambda \gtrsim 5000$\AA) rest frame for $z&gt;9$. We here report on the guaranteed time observations (GTO) from the MIRI European Consortium, of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), forming the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), consisting of an on source integration time of $\sim41$ hours in the MIRI/F560W (5.6 $\mu$m) filter. To our knowledge, this constitutes the longest single filter exposure obtained with JWST of an extragalactic field as yet.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Study of Lopsided Galaxies using Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lopsided galaxies are late-type galaxies with a non-axisymmetric disc due to an uneven distribution of their stellar mass. Despite being a relatively common perturbation, several questions regarding its origin and the information that can be extracted from them about the evolutionary history of late-type galaxies. The advent of several large multi-band photometric surveys will allow us to statistically analyze this perturbation, with information that was not previously available. Given the strong correlation between lopsidedness and the structural properties of the galaxies, this paper aims to develop a method to automatically classify late-type galaxies between lopsided and symmetric. We seek to explore if an accurate classification can be obtain by only considering their internal properties, without additional information about the environment. We select 8000 late-type galaxies from TNG50. A Fourier decomposition of their stellar mass surface density is used to label galaxies as lopsided and symmetric. We trained a Random Forest classifier to rapidly and automatically identify this type of perturbations, exclusively using galaxies internal properties. We test different algorithms to deal with the imbalance of our data and select the most suitable approach based on the considered metrics. We show that our trained algorithm can provide a very accurate and rapid classification of lopsided galaxies. The excellent results obtained by our classifier strongly supports the hypothesis that lopsidedness is mainly a tracer of galaxies internal structures. We show that similar results can be obtained using observable quantities, readily obtainable from multi-bad photometric surveys. Our results show it allows a rapid and accurate classification of lopsided galaxies, allowing us to explore whether lopsidedness in present-day disc galaxies is connected to galaxies specific evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>A Galaxy with an Extremely Blue UV Slope $\beta=-3$ at $z=9.25$ Identified by JWST Spectroscopy: Evidence for a Weak Nebular Continuum and Efficient Ionizing Photon Escape?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate UV continuum slopes $\beta$ of 974 galaxies at $z=4-14$ using archival JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra obtained from major JWST GTO, ERS, and GO programs, including JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER. Among these galaxies, we identify a remarkable galaxy at $z=9.25$, dubbed EBG-1, with a significantly blue UV slope $\beta=-2.99\pm0.15$, unlike the rest of the galaxies that exhibit red continua or ambiguous blue continua hindered by large uncertainties. We confirm that the $\beta$ value negligibly changes by the data reduction and fitting wavelength ranges for UV emission/absorption line masking. The extreme blue slope, $\beta=-3.0$, rules out significant contributions from dust extinction or AGN activity. Comparing with stellar and nebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced solely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy contiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV slopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction, $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \gtrsim 0.5$, for a weak nebular continuum. While the H$\beta$ emission line is not detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity of the spectrum, we find moderately weak [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines for the given star-formation rate ($3\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and stellar mass ($10^{8.0} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) that are about three times weaker than the average emission lines, again suggestive of the high ionizing photon escape fraction, $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \sim 0.7$ or more. EBG-1 would provide crucial insights into stellar and nebular continuum emission in high-redshift galaxies, serving as an example of the ionizing photon escaping site at the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>Stellar streams reveal the mass loss of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular cluster (GC) streams, debris of stars that tidally stripped from their progenitor GCs, have densities that correlate positively with the GC mass loss rate. In this work, we employ a novel particle spray algorithm that can accurately reproduce the morphology of streams of various orbital types, enabling us to uncover the relationship between the GC mass loss history and stream density profiles. Using recent discoveries of GC streams from Gaia DR3, we present, for the first time, direct measurement of mass loss rates for 12 Galactic GCs, ranging from 0.5 to 200 $\rm M_\odot\,Myr^{-1}$. By fitting power-law relations between mass loss rate and key GC properties, we identify positive correlations with GC mass and orbital frequency, consistent with the predictions from N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Epoch Observations of the Nearby Spiral Galaxy NGC 3938 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of two epochs of ACIS observations of the SA(s)c spiral galaxy NGC 3938 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The total exposure time of the observations was 95 ksec with a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of approximately 10^{38}$ ergs/sec assuming a distance of 22 Mpc. A total of 47 discrete merged sources from both epochs were detected at the 3sigma level or greater with the D25 radius. We demonstrate that at the time of the Chandra observations, the nucleus was not detected. We connect the detected sources to counterparts in other wavebands to the degree possible. Based on the two epochs, we identify three variable sources and an additional two that may have varied between the two observations. We do not formally detect any of the five historical supernovae that have occurred in NGC 3938. The luminosity function of NGC 3938 is compared to a recent compilation of 38 galaxies and we identify a potentially significant problem with the `known' distance to NGC 3938. Star formation rate and metallicity values are also computed; the star formation rate is highly dependent upon the adopted distance. The metallicity appears to lie in the range of 8.2-9.2, consistent with values from other work. We include in an appendix a short discussion of the sources that lie in Chandra's field-of-view but lie outside of NGC 3938.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic medium in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey III. Star-forming and quiescent galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM), as the gas repository for star formation, might contain the answer to the mysterious galaxy quenching and bimodal galaxy population origin. We measured the X-ray emission of the hot CGM around star-forming and quiescent galaxies. We detect extended X-ray emission from the hot CGM around star-forming galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)&gt;11.0$ and quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)&gt;10.5$, extending out to $R_{\rm 500c}$. $L_{\rm X, CGM}$ of star-forming galaxies with median stellar masses $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) = 10.7, 11.1, 11.3$ are approximately $0.8\,, 2.3\,, 4.0 \times 10^{40}\,\rm erg/s$, while for quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) = 10.8, 11.1, 11.4$, they are $1.1\,, 6.2\,, 30 \times 10^{40}\,\rm erg/s$. Notably, quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) &gt; 11.0$ exhibit brighter hot CGM than their star-forming counterparts. In halo mass bins, we detect similar X-ray emission around star-forming and quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm 200m}/M_\odot) &gt; 12.5$, suggesting that galaxies in the same mass dark matter halos host equally bright hot CGM. We emphasize the observed $L_{\rm X, CGM} - M_{\rm 500c}$ relations of star-forming and quiescent galaxies are sensitive to the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). A comparison with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, TNG100, and SIMBA) reveals varying degrees of agreement, contingent on the simulation and the specific stellar or halo mass ranges considered. Either selected in stellar mass or halo mass, the star-forming galaxies do not host brighter stacked X-ray emission from the hot CGM than their quiescent counterparts at the same mass range. The result provides useful constraints on the extent of feedback's impacts as a mechanism for quenching star formation as implemented in current cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>SynthPop: A New Framework for Synthetic Milky Way Population Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SynthPop, a new open source, modular population synthesis Galactic modeling software to simulate catalogs of Milky Way stars along any sightline outward from the Sun. Motivated by a lack flexibility in existing Galactic models, SynthPop is coded entirely in python, can be run standalone or as an imported module, and is configured by json files that allow different model components to be switched out as desired. We describe the modular code structure, how the population generation process runs, and how to use the code. We also present model validation testing and known inaccuracies, and present an example of the code use, comparing Gaia data and the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot to a SynthPop implementation. The code is available now via GitHub with ReadTheDocs documentation and can be installed via pip.</description>

      <title>Polarization Calibration of the FAST L-band 19-beam Receiver: II. Beam Measurements of Full Stokes Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) has been fully operational since 11 January 2020. We present a comprehensive analysis of the beam structure for each of the 19 feed horns on FAST's L-band receiver across the Stokes I, Q, U, and V parameters. Using an on-the-fly mapping pattern, we conducted simultaneous sky mapping using all 19 beams directed towards polarization calibrators J1407+2827 and J0854+2006 from 2020 to 2022. Electromagnetic simulations were also performed to model the telescope's beam patterns in all Stokes parameters. Our findings reveal a symmetrical Gaussian pattern in the Stokes I parameter of the central beam without strong sidelobes, while the off-center beams exhibit significant asymmetrical shapes that can be fitted using a combination of log-normal and Gaussian distributions. The inner beams have higher relative beam efficiencies and smaller beam sizes compared to those of the outer beams. The sidelobes of the inner beams contribute approximately 2% of the total flux in the main lobe, increasing to 5% for outer beams, with a peak at 6.8%. In Stokes U, a distinct four-lobed cloverleaf beam squash structure is observed, with similar intensity levels in both inner and outer beams. In Stokes V, a two-lobed beam squint structure is observed in the central beam, along with a secondary eight-lobed structure. The highest squint peak in Stokes V is about 0.3% of the Stokes I in the outer beams. These results align closely with the simulations, providing valuable insights for the design of radio multi-beam observations.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deconvolution of Astronomical Images with Diffusion Models: Quantifying Prior-Driven Features in Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconvolution of astronomical images is a key aspect of recovering the intrinsic properties of celestial objects, especially when considering ground-based observations. This paper explores the use of diffusion models (DMs) and the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) algorithm to solve this inverse problem task. We apply score-based DMs trained on high-resolution cosmological simulations, through a Bayesian setting to compute a posterior distribution given the observations available. By considering the redshift and the pixel scale as parameters of our inverse problem, the tool can be easily adapted to any dataset. We test our model on Hyper Supreme Camera (HSC) data and show that we reach resolutions comparable to those obtained by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Most importantly, we quantify the uncertainty of reconstructions and propose a metric to identify prior-driven features in the reconstructed images, which is key in view of applying these methods for scientific purposes.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs is uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. In this work, we analyze WOH G64, considered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series photometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from semi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy confirms the transition, as WOH~G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in the optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic system formed by a RSG, which transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant, and a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be explained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the return of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind phase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH~G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Effective Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Accurate Galaxy Morphology Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy morphology analysis involves classifying galaxies by their shapes and structures. For this task, directly training domain-specific models on large, annotated astronomical datasets is effective but costly. In contrast, fine-tuning vision foundation models on a smaller set of astronomical images is more resource-efficient but generally results in lower accuracy. To harness the benefits of both approaches and address their shortcomings, we propose GalaxAlign, a novel method that fine-tunes pre-trained foundation models to achieve high accuracy on astronomical tasks. Specifically, our method extends a contrastive learning architecture to align three types of data in fine-tuning: (1) a set of schematic symbols representing galaxy shapes and structures, (2) textual labels of these symbols, and (3) galaxy images. This way, GalaxAlign not only eliminates the need for expensive pretraining but also enhances the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on galaxy classification and similarity search demonstrate that our method effectively fine-tunes general pre-trained models for astronomical tasks by incorporating domain-specific multi-modal knowledge.</description>

      <title>Ice inventory towards the protostar Ced 110 IRS4 observed with the James Webb Space Telescope. Results from the ERS Ice Age program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the ice features toward the binary protostellar system Ced 110 IRS 4A and 4B, and observed with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Ice Age collaboration. We aim to explore the JWST observations of the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B to unveil and quantify the ice inventories toward these sources. We compare the ice abundances with those found for the same molecular cloud. The analysis is performed by fitting or comparing laboratory infrared spectra of ices to the observations. Spectral fits are carried out with the ENIIGMA fitting tool that searches for the best fit. For Ced~110~IRS4B, we detected the major ice species H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$ and NH$_3$. All species are found in a mixture except for CO and CO$_2$, which have both mixed and pure ice components. In the case of Ced~110~IRS4A, we detected the same major species as in Ced~110~IRS4B, as well as the following minor species CH$_4$, SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, OCN$^-$, NH$_4^+$ and HCOOH. Tentative detection of N$_2$O ice (7.75~$\mu$m), forsterite dust (11.2~$\mu$m) and CH$_3^+$ gas emission (7.18~$\mu$m) in the primary source are also presented. Compared with the two lines of sight toward background stars in the Chameleon I molecular cloud, the protostar has similar ice abundances, except in the case of the ions that are higher in IRS4A. The clearest differences are the absence of the 7.2 and 7.4~$\mu$m absorption features due to HCOO$^-$ and icy complex organic molecules in IRS4A and evidence of thermal processing in both IRS4A and IRS4B as probed by the CO$_2$ ice features. We conclude that the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B has a large inventory of icy species. The similar ice abundances in comparison to the starless regions in the same molecular cloud suggest that the chemical conditions of the protostar were set at earlier stages in the molecular cloud.</description>

      <title>Statistics of the supermassive black hole gravitational wave background anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the anisotropy in the gravitational wave (GW) background originating from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We derive the distribution of the GW anisotropy power spectrum coefficients, $C_{l\geq1}/C_0$, in scenarios including environmental effects and eccentricities of the SMBH binaries. Although the mean of $C_{l\geq1}/C_0$ is the same for all multipoles, we show that their distributions vary, with the low $l$ distributions being the widest. We also find a strong correlation between spectral fluctuations and the anisotropy in the GW signal. We show that the GW anisotropy can break the degeneracy between the scenarios including environmental effects or eccentricity. In particular, we find that existing NANOGrav constraints on GW anisotropy begin to constrain SMBH scenarios with strong environmental effects.</description>

      <title>PKS 1424-418: A persistent candidate source of the mm$-\gamma$-ray connection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a long-term strong correlation between millimeter (mm) radio and $\gamma$-ray emission in the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 1424-418. The mm$-\gamma$-ray connection in blazars is generally thought to originate from the relativistic jet close to the central engine. We confirm a unique long-lasting mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation of PKS 1424-418 by using detailed correlation analyses and statistical tests, and we find its physical meaning in the source. We employed ~8.5 yr of (sub)mm and $\gamma$-ray light curves observed by ALMA and Fermi-LAT, respectively. From linear and cross-correlation analyses between the light curves, we found a significant, strong mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation over the whole period. We did not find any notable time delay within the uncertainties for the mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation, which means zero lag. The mm wave spectral index values (S$_{\nu}$ $\propto$ $\nu_{\alpha}$) between the band 3 and 7 flux densities indicate a time-variable opacity of the source at (sub)mm wavelengths. Interestingly, the mm wave spectral index becomes temporarily flatter (i.e., $\alpha$ &gt; $-$0.5) when the source flares in the $\gamma$-rays. We relate our results with the jet of PKS 1424-418, and we discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-rays and opacity of the inner (sub)parsec-scale jet regions.</description>

      <title>A New Look at Disk Winds and External Photoevaporation in the $\sigma$-Orionis Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disk winds play a crucial role in the evolution of protoplanetary disks. Typical conditions for star and planet formation are in regions with intermediate or strong UV radiation fields produced by massive stars. The $\sigma$-Orionis cluster is the ideal site to study disk winds under these conditions; its outer parts can be used to study disk evolution, while its innermost regions to study the effect of external irradiation. For this, we analyze the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300, $\rm [NII]\,\lambda$6583, and $\rm [SII]\,\lambda$6731,$\lambda$6716 lines using high-resolution MIKE spectra of 27 classical T Tauri stars and complemented by intermediate-resolution X-shooter data. We decompose the line profiles into multiple Gaussian components. We calculated luminosities, line ratios, and kinematic properties of these components. We found that the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line luminosity and kinematic properties are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs). The frequency of single-component $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line profiles reflects the expected evolutionary stage given the intermediate age of $\sigma$-Orionis. This points to internal processes contributing to the line emission. However, the highly irradiated disks do not follow the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation found in low-mass SFRs, and all exhibit single-component line profiles. Line ratios of highly ionized species of [NII] and [SII] show higher ratios than typical values found in low-mass SFRs. The innermost regions of $\sigma$-Orionis are clearly affected by external irradiation, evidenced by the lack of correlation in the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation. The broad line widths of close-in sources, however, indicate a contribution from internal processes, such as magnetohydrodynamical winds and/or internal photoevaporation. This suggests a coevolution of internal and external winds in $\sigma$-Orionis.</description>

      <title>Conducting High Frequency Radio SETI using ALMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) remains unparalleled in sensitivity at radio frequencies above 35 GHz. In this paper, we explore ALMA's potential for narrowband technosignature detection, considering factors such as the interferometer's undistorted field of view, signal dilution due to significant drift rates at high frequencies and the possibility of spectral confusion. We present the first technosignature survey using archival ALMA data in Band 3, focusing on two spectral windows centred on 90.642 GHz and 93.151 GHz. Our survey places new limits at these frequencies on the prevalence of extraterrestrial transmitters for 28 galactic stars, selected from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. We employ a stellar 'bycatch' method to sample these objects within the undistorted field of view of four ALMA calibrators. For the closest star in our sample, we find no evidence of transmitters with EIRP_min &gt; 7 x 10^17 W. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first technosignature search conducted using ALMA data.</description>

      <title>Silicon Isotopic Composition of Mainstream Presolar SiC Grains Revisited: The Impact of Nuclear Reaction Rate Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presolar grains are stardust particles that condensed in the ejecta or in the outflows of dying stars and can today be extracted from meteorites. They recorded the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent stars and thus serve as valuable probes of these astrophysical sites. The most common types of presolar silicon carbide grains (called mainstream SiC grains) condensed in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars. Their measured silicon isotopic abundances are not significantly influenced by nucleosynthesis within the parent star, but rather represents the pristine stellar composition. Silicon isotopes can thus be used as a proxy for galactic chemical evolution. However, the measured correlation of $^{29}$Si/$^{28}$Si versus $^{30}$Si/$^{28}$Si does not agree with any current chemical evolution model. Here, we use a Monte Carlo model to vary nuclear reaction rates within their theoretical or experimental uncertainties and process them through stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution models to study the variation of silicon isotope abundances based on these nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. We find that these uncertainties can indeed be responsible for the discrepancy between measurements and models and that the slope of the silicon isotope correlation line measured in mainstream SiC grains agrees with chemical evolution models within the nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. Our result highlights the importance of future precision reaction rate measurements for resolving the apparent data-model discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Detection of a universal core-halo transition in dwarf galaxies as predicted by Bose-Einstein dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.10337v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of large dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies has long been puzzling and many are now known to be surrounded by an extensive halo of stars. Distinctive core-halo structure is characteristic of dark matter as a Bose Einstein condensate, $\psi$DM, with a dense, soliton core predicted in every galaxy, representing the ground state, surrounded by a large, tenuous halo of excited density waves. A marked density transition is predicted between the core and the halo set by the de Broglie wavelength, as the soliton core is a prominent standing wave that is denser by over an order of magnitude than the surrounding halo. Here we identify this predicted behavior in the stellar profiles of the well known "isolated" dwarfs that lie outside the Milky Way, each with a clear density transition at $\simeq 1.0~{\rm kpc}$, implying a very light boson, $m_{\psi} \simeq 10^{-22}$eV. The classical dwarf galaxies orbiting within the Milky Way also show this predicted core-halo structure but with larger density transitions of over two orders of magnitude, that we show implies tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies by the Milky way, as the tenuous halo is more easily stripped than the stable soliton core. We conclude that dark matter as a light boson explains the observed family of classical dwarf profiles with tidal stripping included, in contrast to the standard heavy particle interpretation where low mass galaxies should be concentrated and core-less, quite unlike the core-halo structure observed.</description>

      <title>RUBIES: JWST/NIRSpec Confirmation of an Infrared-luminous, Broad-line Little Red Dot with an Ionized Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $\mu$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M_*\sim 10^9M_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A_{\rm v}\gtrsim4$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$\alpha$ EW $\sim800$\AA). The widths and luminosities of Pa$\beta$, Pa$\delta$, Pa$\gamma$, and H$\alpha$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation of HI-bearing Low Surface Brightness Galaxies Implies Their Formation Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation in low surface brightness galaxies selected from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We find that the $\rm HI$-bearing low surface brightness galaxies still follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation of typical late-type galaxies, with a slope of approximately 4 in the baryonic mass versus rotational velocity diagram on the logarithmic scale, i.e., $M_{\rm{b}}\propto v_{\rm{rot}}^4$. Our findings suggest that the matter distributions in low surface brightness galaxies may resemble that of general late-type galaxies, and hint that low surface brightness galaxies may not originate from dark matter halos of low densities or stronger/weaker feedback processes, but may emerge from dark matter halos with high spin values.</description>

      <title>Assessing the accuracy of the star formation rate measurements by direct star count in molecular clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>JWST, ALMA, and Keck Spectroscopic Constraints on the UV Luminosity Functions at z~7-14: Clumpiness and Compactness of the Brightest Galaxies in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the number densities and physical properties of the bright galaxies spectroscopically confirmed at $z\sim7-14$. Our sample is composed of 60 galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}\sim7-14$, including recently-confirmed galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}=12.34-14.32$ with JWST, as well as new confirmations at $z_\mathrm{spec}=6.583-7.643$ with $-24&lt; M_\mathrm{UV}&lt; -21$ mag using ALMA and Keck. Our JWST/NIRSpec observations have also revealed that very bright galaxy candidates at $z\sim10-13$ identified from ground-based telescope images before JWST are passive galaxies at $z\sim3-4$, emphasizing the necessity of strict screening and spectroscopy in the selection of the brightest galaxies at $z&gt;10$. The UV luminosity functions derived from these spectroscopic results are consistent with a double power-law function, showing tensions with theoretical models at the bright end. To understand the origin of the overabundance of bright galaxies, we investigate their morphologies using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution images obtained in various surveys including PRIMER and COSMOS-Web. We find that $\sim70\%$ of the bright galaxies at $z\sim7$ exhibit clumpy morphologies with multiple sub-components, suggesting merger-induced starburst activity, which is consistent with SED fitting results showing bursty star formation histories. At $z\gtrsim10$, bright galaxies are classified into two types of galaxies; extended ones with weak high-ionization emission lines, and compact ones with strong high-ionization lines including NIV]$\lambda$1486, indicating that at least two different processes (e.g., merger-induced starburst and compact star formation/AGN) are shaping the physical properties of the brightest galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ and are responsible for their overabundance.</description>

Abstract: The gas-phase metallicity distribution within galaxies records critical information about galactic evolution. In this work we investigate how active galactic nuclei (AGN) influence this distribution by measuring the two-point correlation functions of gas-phase metallicity in 95 non-AGN and 37 AGN-host galaxies from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field spectroscopy Area integral field spectrographic survey. We measure metallicity using a novel Bayesian method that properly includes both stellar and AGN contributions to emission line fluxes and allows us to measure metallicities in both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies in a single, consistent framework. We find that the two-point correlation functions of both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies are well-fit by a simple injection-diffusion model, and that the correlation lengths $l_\mathrm{corr}$ we derive for the non-AGN galaxies are reasonably consistent with those obtained in earlier work. The AGN-host galaxies generally have smaller $l_\mathrm{corr}$ than non-AGN galaxies at fixed stellar mass, but similar $l_\mathrm{corr}$ at fixed star formation rate (SFR), suggesting that the primary effect of hosting an AGN in this sample is a reduction in SFR at fixed stellar mass, and that this in turn suppresses the correlation length. Our findings further indicate that, while both SFR and stellar mass are positively correlated with metallicity correlation length $l_\mathrm{corr}$, the former is more fundamental, implying that fluctuations in the metallicity distribution within galaxies are driven more by short-term responses to physical processes such as star formation that can change much faster than a Hubble time.</description>

      <title>The formation of supermassive black holes from Population III.1 seeds. III. Galaxy evolution and black hole growth from semi-analytic modelling</title>

Abstract: We present an implementation of Pop III.1 seeding of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in a theoretical model of galaxy formation and evolution to assess the growth the SMBH population and the properties of the host galaxies. The model of Pop III.1 seeding involves SMBH formation at redshifts $z\gtrsim 20$ in dark matter minihalos that are isolated from external radiative feedback, parameterized by isolation distance $d_{\rm iso}$. Within a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we generate dark matter halos using the code PINOCCHIO and seed them according to the Pop III.1 scenario, exploring values of $d_{\rm iso}$ from 50 to 100~kpc (proper distance). We consider two alternative cases of SMBH seeding: a Halo Mass Threshold (HMT) model in which all halos $&gt;7\times10^{10}\:M_\odot$ are seeded with $\sim 10^5\:M_\odot$ black holes; an All Light Seed (ALS) model in which all halos are seeded with low, stellar-mass black holes. We follow the redshift evolution of the halos, populating them with galaxies using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly theoretical model of galaxy formation, including accretion on SMBHs and related feedback processes. Here we present predictions for the properties of galaxy populations, focusing on stellar masses, star formation rates, and black hole masses. The local, $z\sim0$ metrics of occupation fraction as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), and black hole mass function (BHMF) all suggest a constraint of $d_{\rm iso}&lt;75\:$kpc. We discuss the implications of this result for the Pop III.1 seeding mechanism.</description>

      <title>Impact of star formation models on the growth of galaxies at high redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation is a key process that governs the baryon cycle within galaxies, but how it controls their growth remains elusive due to modeling uncertainties. To understand the impact of star formation models on galaxy evolution, we perform cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of a dwarf dark matter halo with virial mass of 1e9 Msun at z=6. Two different star formation models are compared, a multi-freefall model combined with a local gravo-thermo-turbulent condition, and a more self-consistent model based on a sink particle algorithm where gas accretion and star formation are directly controlled by the gas kinematics. As a first study in this series, we use cosmological zoom-in simulations with different spatial resolutions and find that star formation is more bursty in the runs with the sink algorithm, generating stronger outflows than in the runs with the gravo-thermo-turbulent model. The main reason for the increased burstiness is that the gas accretion rates on the sinks are high enough to form stars on very short timescales, leading to more clustered star formation. As a result, the star-forming clumps are disrupted more quickly in the sink run due to more coherent radiation and supernova feedback. The difference in burstiness between the two star formation models becomes even more pronounced when the supernova explosion energy is artificially increased. Our results suggest that improving the modeling of star formation on small, sub-molecular cloud scales can significantly impact the global properties of simulated galaxies.</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamical states on galaxy clusters populations. I. Classification of dynamical states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the influence of galaxy clusters on galaxy evolution is relatively well-understood, the impact of the dynamical states of these clusters is less clear. This paper series explores how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters affects their galaxy populations' physical and morphological properties. The primary aim of this first paper is to evaluate the dynamical state of 87 massive ($M_{500} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters at low redshifts ($0.10 \leq z \leq 0.35$). This will allow us to have a well-characterized sample for analyzing physical and morphological properties in our next work. We employ six dynamical state proxies utilizing optical and X-ray imaging data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to integrate these proxies effectively, allowing for robust classification of galaxy clusters into relaxed, intermediate, and disturbed states based on their dynamical characteristics. The methodology successfully segregates the galaxy clusters into the three dynamical states. Examination of the galaxy distributions in optical wavelengths and gas distributions in X-ray further confirms the consistency of these classifications. The clusters' dynamical states are statistically distinguishable, providing a clear categorization for further analysis.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas budget of strongly magnified low-mass star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the molecular gas content of strongly magnified low-mass star-forming galaxies around the cosmic noon period ($z\sim2$) through observations of CO emission lines and dust continuum emission, both of which serve as tracers for molecular gas. We observed twelve strongly lensed galaxies with the Atacama Compact Array to detect CO mid-j rotational transitions and dust continuum. Thanks to the strong lensing, we were able to probe the low-mass regime, previously understudied. With a compiled set of observations, we recalibrate empirical relations between star formation rate density and the CO line ratios. Using SED fitting, we derived galaxy properties and performed galaxy stacking to combine the faint signals. In all cases, molecular gas masses were estimated using both tracers. We detected CO emission in three out of 12 galaxies and dust continuum emission in three of them. The obtained molecular gas masses indicate that most of these galaxies ($\rm{M}_* &lt; 10^{10.7}$ $\rm{M}_\odot$) have lower molecular gas fractions and shorter depletion times compared to the expectations from established scaling relations at these redshifts. Several possible explanations for this gas deficit were explored, including uncertainties in mass estimates, effects of low metallicity environments, larger atomic gas reservoirs in low-mass systems, and the possibility that these represent low-mass analogs of "main sequence starburst" galaxies, which are undergoing sustained star formation due to gas compaction despite low overall gas fractions. We conclude that there is a molecular gas deficit at these mass and metallicity regimes. Our results suggest that this deficit is likely due to a significant amount of atomic gas, which our stacking indicates is about 91% of the total gas. However, this estimation might be an upper limit in the case of our galaxies containing CO-dark gas.</description>

      <title>JADES: Measuring reionization properties using Lyman-alpha emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ is the transition to the ground state from the first excited state of hydrogen (the most common element). Resonant scattering of this line by neutral hydrogen greatly impedes its emergence from galaxies, so the fraction of galaxies emitting Ly$\alpha$ is a tracer of the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and thus the history of reionisation. In previous works, we used early JWST/NIRSpec data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to classify and characterise Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs). This survey is approaching completion, and the current sample is nearly an order of magnitude larger. From a sample of 795 galaxies in JADES at $4.0&lt;z&lt;14.3$, we find evidence for Ly$\alpha$ emission in 150sources. We reproduce the previously found correlation between Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$) - Ly$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width ($REW_{Ly\alpha}$) and the negative correlation between Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset - $f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$. Both $f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$ and $REW_{Ly\alpha}$ decrease with redshift ($z\gtrsim5.5$), indicating the progression of reionisation on a population scale. Our data are used to demonstrate an increasing IGM transmission of Ly$\alpha$ from $z\sim14-6$. We measure the completeness-corrected fraction of LAEs (\xlya) from $z=4-9.5$. An application of these \xlya values to the results of previously utilised semi-analytical models suggests a high neutral fraction at $z=7$ ($X_{HI}\sim0.8-0.9$). Using an updated fit to the intrinsic distribution of $REW_{Ly\alpha}$ results in a lower value in agreement with current works ($X_{HI}=0.64_{-0.21}^{+0.13}$). This sample of LAEs will be paramount for unbiased population studies of galaxies in the EoR.</description>

      <title>3D ISM structure challenges the Serkowski relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Serkowski relation is the cornerstone of studies of starlight polarization as a function of wavelength. Although empirical, its extensive use since its inception to describe polarization induced by interstellar dust has elevated the relation to the status of an indisputable "law", serving as the benchmark for validating interstellar dust grain models. We revisit the effects of the 3D structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) on the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization. We use analytical models to show how the wavelength dependence of both the polarization fraction and direction is affected by the presence of multiple clouds along the line of sight (LOS), accounting for recent developments in dust distribution modelling and utilizing an expanded archive of stellar polarization measurements. We highlight concrete examples of stars whose polarization profiles are severely affected by LOS variations of the dust grain and magnetic field properties, and we provide a recipe to accurately fit multiple cloud Serkowski models to such cases. We present, for the first time, compelling observational evidence that the 3D structure of the magnetized ISM often results to the violation of the Serkowski relation. We show that 3D effects impact interstellar cloud parameters derived from Serkowski fits. In particular, the dust size distribution in single - cloud sightlines may differ from analyses that ignore 3D effects, with important implications for dust modelling in the Galaxy. Our results suggest that multiband stellar polarization measurements offer an independent probe of the LOS variations of the magnetic field, constituting a valuable new tool for the 3D cartography of the ISM. We caution that, unless 3D effects are explicitly accounted for, a poor fit to the Serkowski relation does not, by itself, constitute conclusive evidence that a star is intrinsically polarized.</description>

      <title>Comparing E-MOSAICS predictions of high-redshift proto-globular clusters with JWST observations in lensed galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging and strong gravitational lensing of high-redshift galaxies have enabled the detection of compact sources with properties similar to nearby massive star clusters. Often found to be very young, these sources may be globular clusters detected in their earliest stages. In this work, we compare predictions of high-redshift ($z \sim 1$--$10$) star cluster properties from the E-MOSAICS simulation of galaxy and star cluster formation with those of the star cluster candidates in strongly lensed galaxies from James Webb (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. We select galaxies in the simulation that match the luminosities of the majority of lensed galaxies with star cluster candidates observed with JWST. We find that the luminosities, ages and masses of the brightest star cluster candidates in the high-redshift galaxies are consistent with the E-MOSAICS model. In particular, the brightest cluster ages are in excellent agreement. The results suggest that star clusters in both low- and high-redshift galaxies may form via common mechanisms. However, the brightest clusters in the lensed galaxies tend to be $\approx 1$--$1.5$ mag brighter and $\approx 0.5$ dex more massive than the median E-MOSAICS predictions. We discuss the large number of effects that could explain the discrepancy, including simulation and observational limitations, stellar population models, cluster detection biases and nuclear star clusters. Understanding these limitations would enable stronger tests of globular cluster formation models.</description>

      <title>Combining Direct Black Hole Mass Measurements and Spatially Resolved Stellar Kinematics to Calibrate the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_\star$ Relation of Active Galaxies</title>

Abstract: The origin of the tight scaling relation between the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$) and their host-galaxy properties remains unclear. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) probe phases of ongoing SMBH growth and offer the only opportunity to measure $M_{\rm BH}$ beyond the local Universe. However, determining AGN host galaxy stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_\star$, and their galaxy dynamical masses $M_{\rm dyn}$, is complicated by AGN contamination, aperture effects and different host galaxy morphologies. We select a sample of AGNs for which $M_{\rm BH}$ has been independently determined to high accuracy by state-of-the-art techniques: dynamical modeling of the reverberation signal and spatially resolving the broad-line region with VLTI/GRAVITY. Using IFU observations, we spatially map the host galaxy stellar kinematics across the galaxy and bulge effective radii. We find that that the dynamically hot component of galaxy disks correlates with $M_{\rm BH}$; however, the correlations are tightest for aperture-integrated $\sigma_\star$ measured across the bulge. Accounting for the different $M_{\rm BH}$ distributions, we demonstrate - for the first time - that AGNs follow the same $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_\star$ and $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge, dyn}$ relations as quiescent galaxies. We confirm that the classical approach of determining the virial factor as sample-average, yielding ${\rm log }f= 0.65 \pm 0.18$, is consistent with the average $f$ from individual measurements. The similarity between the underlying scaling relations of AGNs and quiescent galaxies implies that the current AGN phase is too short to have altered BH masses on a population level. These results strengthen the local calibration of $f$ for measuring single-epoch $M_{\rm BH}$ in the distant Universe.</description>

Abstract: HeH$^+$ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH$^+$, ArH$^+$, and NeH$^+$) to investigate their formation in harsh environments like the nova outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on previously published best-fit physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova, QU Vulpeculae 1984, and the CO type novae, RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH$^+$, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit on the surface brightness of HeH$^+$ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii, which have similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It must be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, and not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining the physical conditions in similar types of systems and for validating our predictions based on new electron-impact ro-vibrational collisional data at temperatures of up to 20,000 K.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Scaling Relations in the Dwarf-galaxy Regime with $Gaia$-Sausage/Enceladus and $\omega$Centauri</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of fast moving stars in the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster, $\omega$Centauri ($\omega$Cen), has provided strong evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) inside of it. However, $\omega$Cen is known to be the stripped nuclear star cluster (NSC) of an ancient, now-destroyed, dwarf galaxy. The best candidate to be the original host progenitor of $\omega$Cen is the tidally disrupted dwarf $Gaia$-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE), a former Milky Way satellite as massive as the Large Magellanic Cloud. I compare $\omega$Cen/GSE with other central BH hosts and place it within the broader context of BH-galaxy (co)evolution. The IMBH of $\omega$Cen/GSE follows the scaling relation between central BH mass and host stellar mass (${\rm M}_{\rm BH}{-}{\rm M}_\star$) extrapolated from local massive galaxies (${\rm M}_\star \gtrsim 10^{10}\,{\rm M}_\odot$). Therefore, the IMBH of $\omega$Cen/GSE suggests that this relation extends to the dwarf-galaxy regime. I verify that $\omega$Cen (GSE), as well as other NSCs with candidate IMBHs and ultracompact dwarf galaxies, also follow the ${\rm M}_{\rm BH}{-}\sigma_\star$ relation with stellar velocity dispersion. Under the assumption of a direct collapse BH, $\omega$Cen/GSE's IMBH would require a low initial mass ($\lesssim$10,000 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$) and almost no accretion over $\sim$3 Gyr, which could be the extreme opposite of high-$z$ galaxies with overmassive BHs such as GN-z11. If $\omega$Cen/GSE's IMBH formed from a Population III supernova remnant, then it could indicate that both light and heavy seeding mechanisms of central BH formation are at play. Other stripped NSCs and dwarf galaxies could help further populate the ${\rm M}_{\rm BH}{-}{\rm M}_{\star}$ and ${\rm M}_{\rm BH}{-}\sigma_\star$ relations in the low-mass regime and constraint IMBH demographics and their formation channels.</description>

      <title>Misty, patchy, and turbulent: constraining the cold circumgalactic medium with mCC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the largest baryon reservoir around galaxies, but its extent, mass, and temperature distribution remain uncertain. We propose that cold gas in the CGM resides primarily in $\sim 100 \hbox{--} 10^4$ cloud complexes (CCs), each containing a mist of tiny cold cloudlets dispersed in a warm/hot medium ($\sim 10^5 \hbox{--} 10^6$~K). Modeling CCs as uniform and misty simplifies the calculation of observables like ion absorption columns compared to resolving tiny individual cloudlets. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we explore how CC properties affect the observed spread in column densities. A power-law distribution of CCs ($dN_{\rm CC}/dR \propto R^{-1.2}$) reproduces MgII equivalent width (EW) and column density distribution trends with impact parameter ($R_\perp$). We show that the area-averaged MgII column density, combined with the covering fraction of CCs, provides a robust proxy for estimating the cold CGM mass, independent of other model parameters. Modeling individual CCs demonstrates that turbulent broadening blends cloudlet absorption lines, allowing CCs to approximate the observational effects of their constituent cloudlets analytically. Direct simulations of cloudlets within multiple CCs confirm the computational challenges of fully resolving the mist-like structure. Comparing modeled MgII absorption with observations, we estimate the cold CGM mass of Milky Way-like galaxies to be $\sim 10^{10} \, M_\odot$, about $10\%$ of the total CGM mass. This work provides a practical framework for connecting CGM models with observations, shedding light on the cold gas distribution in galaxy halos and its role in the galactic baryon cycle.</description>

Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>
