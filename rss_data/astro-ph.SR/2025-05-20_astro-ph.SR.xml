      <title>Ultraviolet variability in Solar-type members of the M67 open cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar-type members of the rich, nearly Solar-age and Solar-metallicity M67 open cluster are systematically investigated for ultraviolet variability. We utilize archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) data which features several imaging observation epochs spanning 5 years. Stars in or suspected of being in binary systems are avoided as well as stars that are blended in GALEX data, leading to a sample of 66 Solar-type stars. We assess variability over a variety of timescales that probe flares and longer-term trends that could be due to rotation and activity cycles. We do not find conclusive evidence for variability and determine that Solar-type members of M67 do not display &gt;30% near-ultraviolet variability over timescales ranging from days to years. Furthermore, within 50-second cadence lightcurves generated for each of the imaging epochs we find no near-ultraviolet flares that are &gt;~2x the quiescent stellar near-ultraviolet emission level; the implied ultraviolet flare rate derived from this study is in mild tension with that derived for stars observed by GALEX in the primary Kepler field. This M67 GALEX study presents one of the most comprehensive ultraviolet datasets currently available for probing continuum emission variability for old Sun-like stars; the planned NASA UVEX mission has the potential to dramatically expand upon this work.</description>

      <title>Carbon-rich dust injected into the interstellar medium by Galactic WC binaries survives for hundreds of years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars) show an infrared excess from dust emission. Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds. Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST/MIRI revealed at least 17 concentric dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in 2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, surviving for at least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust, finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects. These results demonstrate that WC dust is indeed long-lived and should be accounted for in galactic dust budgets.</description>

      <title>Time-evolving coronal modelling of solar maximum around the May 2024 storm by COCONUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal simulations of the solar maximum struggle with poor numerical stability and low computational efficiency since the magnetic field is more complex and stronger and coronal structures evolve more rapidly. This paper aims to enhance the numerical stability of the time-evolving COCONUT coronal model to mitigate these issues, to evaluate differences between the time-evolving and quasi-steady-state coronal simulation results, and to assess the impact of spatial resolution on global MHD coronal modelling of solar maximum.After enhancing the positivity-preserving property of the time-evolving COCONUT, we employ it to simulate the evolution of coronal structures from the solar surface to 0.1 AU over two CRs around the May 2024 solar storm event. These simulations are performed on unstructured meshes containing 6.06, 1.52, and 0.38 M cells to assess the impact of grid resolution. We also conduct a quasi-steady-state coronal simulation, treating the solar surface as a rigidly rotating spherical shell, to demonstrate the impact of magnetic flux emergence and cancellation in global coronal simulations. Comparison with observations further validates the reliability of this model.This paper demonstrates that incorporating magnetic field evolution in inner-boundary conditions can significantly improve the fidelity of global MHD coronal simulations around solar maximum. The simulated magnetic field strength using a refined mesh with 6.06 M cells can be more than 40% stronger than that in the coarser mesh with 0.38 M cells. A time step of 5 minutes and the mesh containing 1.5 M cells can effectively capture the evolution of large-scale coronal structures and small-sized dipoles. Thus, this model shows promise for accurately conducting real-time global coronal simulations of solar maximum, making it suitable for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Deformation and differential rotation in slowly rotating young intermediate-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology, the study of stellar vibrations, is a method which can probe the structure deformation and internal rotation of stars. Salient among the seismic inferences of rotation from TESS observations are TIC 408165734, whose equatorial rotation rate is 10\% faster than the pole, and TIC 307930890, which has significant radial shear and shows a decreasing spin rate outward through its envelope. We also measure structural deformation in fifteen stars, nine of which are oblate, a finding consistent with expectations for relatively fast-rotating, non-magnetic stars. The difference between polar and equatorial radii in TIC 47639058 is 130 times larger than that for the Sun. The remaining six stars display splittings consistent with a prolate shape (surprisingly), possibly indicating the presence of equatorial toroidal magnetic fields. These inferences provide constraints for numerical simulations and new insights to guide theories of $\delta$ Scuti structure and rotation.</description>

      <title>Flux and Color of WISE 0855-0714</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WISE 0855-0714 is the coldest known brown dwarf, located 2.28 pc from the solar system. Discovered by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2014 (Luhman 2014), the object is of interest to scientists because of its low temperature ($\approx270$ K), proximity to the solar system, small mass ($\sim3-10\: M_{J}$), and high proper motion. The first observations of W0855 by WISE in 2010 are heavily contaminated by a background source. With 10.5 years of observations following the NEOWISE reactivation in 2013 (Mainzer et al., 2014), we present a robust analysis of W0855's flux and color unobstructed by this background source. We obtain W1 = 19.3 and W1-W2 = 5.4 magnitudes with an error of 0.37 magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.</description>

      <title>Evidence that Mass Loss on the Red Giant Branch Decreases with Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) influences stellar evolution, properties of stellar populations, and Galactic chemical enrichment, yet remains poorly constrained observationally. Current models provide limited insight into how stellar properties, particularly how metallicity and mass, affects RGB mass loss. Here, I introduce a new observational approach that uses the age-velocity-dispersion relation and the lower-mass boundary of red giants as precise evolutionary markers. These markers, informed by Galactic evolution, allow us to construct observational isochrones for field stars. By comparing masses of RGB stars and red clump (RC) stars at the same age in the Kepler sample, I derive empirical measurements of integrated RGB mass loss at several points in age and metallicity. Combining these new observational measurements with open-cluster studies, I showed that the integrated mass loss on the RGB decreases with metallicity, and may also decrease with stellar mass. The average mass loss rate, which accounts for RGB lifetimes and the initial mass differences between RGB and RC stars at the same age, also show a similar trend. These findings challenge current mass-loss prescriptions widely adopted in stellar evolutionary models, since none of them is able to produce the observed mass-loss trend without widely adjusting free parameters. This highlights an urgent need to revise mechanisms that govern RGB mass loss.</description>

      <title>A magnetic tertiary in the most massive compact triple-star system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system TIC 470710327 is comprised of three main-sequence OB stars, with an inner compact 1.10 d eclipsing binary and a non-eclipsing tertiary on a 52.04 d orbit. With the tertiary mass of 14.5-16 $M_{\odot}$ and both components in the inner eclipsing binary with individual masses of 6--7 and 5.5-6.3 $M_{\odot}$, it is currently the most massive compact system known. The formation scenario of such a compact triple is uncertain. It has been suggested that `2 + 2' quadruple dynamics can lead to a stellar merger in the initially more massive binary and finally result in a highly magnetised tertiary. Our study confirms the presence of a kG-order magnetic field in the tertiary and the slow rotation typical for massive magnetic stars. We conclude that finding massive merger candidates by studies of dynamics in compact, multiple-star systems is an efficient way to understand the evolution of massive stellar multiplicity and the generation of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Source location and evolution of a multi-lane type II radio burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shocks in the solar corona can accelerate electrons that in turn generate radio emission known as type II radio bursts. The characteristics and morphology of these radio bursts in the dynamic spectrum reflect the evolution of the shock itself, together with the properties of the local corona where it propagates. In this work, we study the evolution of a complex type II radio burst showing a multi-lane structure, to find the locations where the radio emission is produced and relate them to the properties of the local environment. Using radio imaging, we track separately each lane composing the type II burst and relate the position of the emission to the properties of the ambient medium such as density, Alfven speed, and magnetic field. We show that the radio burst morphology in the dynamic spectrum changes with time and it is related to the complexity of the local environment. The initial stage of the radio emission show a single lane in the spectrum, while the latter stages of the radio signature evolve in a multi-lane scenario. The radio imaging reveals how the initial stage of the radio emission separates with time into different locations along the shock front as the density and orientation of the magnetic field change along the shock propagation. At the time where the spectrum shows a multi-lane shape, we found a clear separation of the imaged radio sources. By combining radio imaging with the properties of the local corona, we described the evolution of a type II radio burst and, for the first time, identified three distinct radio emission regions above the CME front. Two regions were located at the flanks, producing earlier radio emission than the central position, in accordance with the complexity of density and Alfven speed values in the regions where radio emission is generated. This unprecedented observation provides new insights into the nature of multi-lane type II bursts.</description>

      <title>gr8stars I: A homogeneous spectroscopic study of bright FGKM dwarfs and a public library of their high-resolution spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the fields of stellar and exoplanetary study grow and revolutionary new detection instruments are created, it is imperative that a homogeneous, precise source of stellar parameters is available. This first work of the gr8stars collaboration presents the all-sky magnitude limited sample of 5645 bright FGKM dwarfs, along with homogeneously derived spectroscopic parameters of a subset of 1716 targets visible from the Northern hemisphere. We have collected high-resolution archival and new spectra from several instruments. Spectrosocpic parameters are determined using the PAWS pipeline, employing both the curve-of-growth equivalent width method, and the spectral synthesis method. We achieve median uncertainties of 106K in stellar effective temperature, 0.08 dex in surface gravity, and 0.03 dex in metallicity. This paper also presents photometric stellar parameters for these dwarfs, determined using SED fitting. The full gr8stars sample selection, including derived spectroscopic and photometric parameters, is made available through an interactive online database. We also perform a kinematic analysis to classify these stars according to their Galactic component.</description>

      <title>Observing the Sun with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST): Forecasting Full-disk Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionised the field of solar millimetre astronomy with its high angular resolution and cadence. However, with a limited field of view (FOV), targeted observations of highly dynamic phenomena such of flares are challenging. A large aperture single-dish telescope with a large FOV, such as the future Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), would prove useful in observing such phenomena, as one could scan the full solar disk on shorter timescales. We aimed to explore what FOVs, detector counts, and scan strategies are suitable for AtLAST to push the required full-disk scan times below 1 minute, enabling regular observations of dynamic solar phenomena. Utilising the maria code, we were able to simulate solar observations with AtLAST, and thoroughly explored how instrumental properties and scanning strategies affect the full-disk observations in the planned frequency bands. We find the double-circle scan pattern, currently employed at ALMA for full-disk mapping to also be an acceptable way of scanning the Sun with AtLAST. Using small to intermediately sized instruments (1000 - 50,000 detector elements), the estimated observational cadence would be less than 1 minute across AtLAST's frequency range with a reasonable pixel spacing. Using instruments with larger FOVs ($\gtrapprox 0.25^\circ$, equivalent to $\gtrapprox$ 1 R$_\odot$), we find a simple circular scan to be more efficient, achieving cadences on second time scales, but requiring more detector elements ($\gtrapprox$ 100,000). We find that a large FOV single-dish telescope such as AtLAST could provide the solar millimetre community with hitherto unachievable observations, namely full-disk observations at high cadence and adequate resolution. With cadences potentially down to seconds, such an instrument would be ideal in the study of quickly evolving solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the stability analysis of cooling functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To model the temperature evolution of optically thin astrophysical environments at MHD scales, radiative and collisional cooling rates are typically either pre-tabulated or fit into a functional form and then input into MHD codes as a radiative loss function. Thermal balance requires estimates of the analogous heating rates, which are harder to calculate, and due to uncertainties in the underlying dissipative heating processes, these rates are often simply parameterized. The resulting net cooling function defines an equilibrium curve that varies with density and temperature. Such cooling functions can make the gas prone to thermal instability (TI), which will cause departures from equilibrium. There has been no systematic study of thermally unstable parameter space for nonequilibrium states. Motivated by our recent finding that there is a related linear instability, catastrophic cooling instability, that can dominate over TI, here we carry out such a study. We show that Balbus' instability criteria for TI can be used to define a critical cooling rate, $\Lambda_c$, that permits a nonequilibrium analysis of cooling functions through the mapping of TI zones. We furthermore extend Balbus' criteria to account for thermal conduction. Upon applying a $\Lambda_c$-based stability analysis to coronal loop simulations, we find that loops undergoing periodic episodes of coronal rain formation are linearly unstable to catastrophic cooling instability, while TI is stabilized by thermal conduction.</description>

      <title>Early Post Asymptotic Giant Branch Instability: Does it Affect White Dwarf Hydrogen Envelope Mass?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although most white dwarf stars have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, a significant fraction have atmospheres in which hydrogen is spectroscopically absent, with the fraction of hydrogen-free atmospheres varying with effective temperature. Estimates of the total mass of hydrogen, $M_H$, in the stellar envelope from either asteroseismology or spectral evolution are at odds with predicted values from theoretical stellar evolution modeling. Recent work has found that models in the early post AGB phase of evolution can exhibit thermally and dynamical unstable behavior. Here we investigate whether this Early Post AGB Instability (EPAGBI) can help resolve the conflict in $M_H$ values determined from white dwarf spectral evolution, analysis of DAV pulsations and canonical stellar evolution modeling, by evolving solar composition models of mass $1$ and $2 M_\odot$ through the AGB phases and to the white dwarf cooling track. The $M_H$ values at the end of the calculations are in the range consistent with asteroseismological determinations. However, we caution that, because hydrodynamic behavior is not included in our modeling, it is possible that all hydrogen would be removed. Thus, it is unclear whether the occurrence of the EPAGBI resolves the discrepancy between predictions of stellar evolution modeling and the asteroseismological hydrogen envelope mass determinations. The major impact of EPAGBIs is that they cause loops in the HRD. For models of AGB-departure mass 0.567 and 0.642 $M_\odot$, it takes approximately 100 and 10 yr for a single HRD loop, respectively. Such loops might be detectable in a long-term monitoring program, or perhaps by their imprint on planetary nebula morphology imparted by the cyclically varying mass loss rate.</description>

      <title>Proton heating estimates from near-Earth observations of coronal mass ejections in solar cycle 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) propagate through the heliosphere, they expend energy in heating protons to compensate for the cooling that occurs due to expansion. CME propagation models usually treat energy dissipation implicitly via a polytropic index ($\delta$). Here we calculate the power dissipation implied by a given $\delta$ and compare it with the power available in the turbulent velocity fluctuations. We make this comparison using near-Earth {\em in-situ} observations of 27 of the most geoeffective CMEs ($D_{\rm st} &lt; -75$ nT) in solar cycle 24. For $\delta = 5/3$, the power in the turbulent velocity fluctuations is $\approx 54$\% smaller than what would be required to maintain the proton temperature at the observed values. If the power in the turbulent cascade is assumed to be fully expended in local proton heating, the most probable value for $\delta$ is 1.35. Our results contribute to a better understanding of CME energetics, and thereby to improved CME propagation models and estimates of Earth arrival times.</description>

      <title>Plasma refilling of the lunar wake: plasma-vacuum interactions, electrostatic shocks, and electromagnetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plasma void forms downstream of the Moon when the solar wind impacts the lunar surface. This void gradually refills as the solar wind passes by, forming the lunar wake. We investigate this refilling process using a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The early stage of refilling follows plasma-vacuum interaction theory, characterized by exponential decay of plasma density into the wake, along with ion acceleration and cooling in the expansion direction. Our PIC simulation confirms these theoretical predictions. In the next stage of the refilling process, the counter-streaming supersonic ion beams collide, generating Debye-scale electrostatic shocks at the wake's center. These shocks decelerate and thermalize the ion beams while heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions along magnetic field lines. Additionally, fast magnetosonic waves undergo convective growth via anomalous cyclotron resonance as they co-propagate with temperature-anisotropic ion beams toward the wake's center. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves may also be excited through normal cyclotron resonance, counter-propagating with these anisotropic ion beams. Our findings provide new insights into the kinetic aspects of lunar wake refilling and may enhance interpretation of spacecraft observations.</description>

      <title>The NEID Earth Twin Survey. II. Dynamical Masses in Seven High-acceleration Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of companion dynamical masses and orbital parameters of seven star systems from the NEID Earth Twin Survey with significant absolute astrometric accelerations between the epochs of Hipparcos and Gaia. These include four binary star systems (HD 68017 AB, 61 Cygni AB, HD 24496 AB, and HD 4614 AB) and three planetary systems (HD 217107, HD 190360, and HD 154345). Our analyses incorporate a long baseline of RVs that includes over 1100 previously unpublished measurements from NEID and MINERVA, extending the overall RV baseline for each system by $\approx$2.5 years, as well as relative astrometry for the stellar binary systems where the positions of both stars are well-measured. In each case, the combination of astrometry and RVs constrains the three-dimensional acceleration of the host star and enables precise dynamical masses. We publish true masses for three planets whose measurements were previously entangled with their inclinations, four stellar masses with $\lesssim$1% relative precision, and improved orbital solutions for all seven systems, including the first for HD 24496 AB. These solutions not only agree with previous estimates, but also improve their fidelity. We also explore each system for evidence of periodic signals in the residuals around our best-fit models, and discuss the potential that the three planetary systems have for being directly imaged. With dynamical mass estimates and reliable orbit ephemerides, these seven star systems represent promising benchmarks for future stellar and planetary characterization efforts, and are amenable for further improvement with the upcoming release of Gaia epoch astrometry.</description>

      <title>Electric fields and waves in the Venus nightside magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On November 6, 2024, the Parker Solar Probe flew past Venus to make the first accurate electric field measurement in the nightside Venusian magnetosphere. To achieve this result, the electric field antennas were current biased in a way never before experienced by an electric field detector. This biasing requirement, that the positive bias current in the Venus shadow be about equal to the electron thermal current, is discussed and illustrated. About one minute of useful electric f ield data in the eight-minute nightside magnetosphere crossing was obtained, during which the only feature observed was a few Hz signal. This result, along with the magnetic field measurements, showed that there were few if any electromagnetic waves, such as low-frequency electromagnetic turbulence or whistlers, in the nightside crossing. Instead, a few Hertz, purely electrostatic signal was found. This suggests that the interaction of the solar wind with an unmagnetized body having an ionosphere may be different from that of previously studied magnetized bodies. In the sunlit flanks, many electromagnetic wave modes were observed. These results describe the first step in the proper technique for future measurements of electric fields in shadow.</description>

      <title>Formation of a Possible Black-hole Ultracompact X-ray Binary with the Shortest Orbital Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the bulge of M31, the Chandra observations discovered a possible black hole (BH) ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) Seq.1 with an orbital period of 7.7 minutes and a maximum X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}=1.09^{+0.02}_{-0.01}\times10^{38}~ \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ in the $0.5-8$ keV band. The minimum orbital period of the BH UCXBs predicted by the standard magnetic braking (MB) model is longer than 8.3 minutes. In this work, we investigate whether the convection- and rotation-boosted (CARB) MB prescription can account for the formation of a BH UCXB like Seq.1. Our detailed stellar evolution models indicate that the CARB MB law can drive isolated BH-main sequence (MS) binaries to evolve toward BH UCXBs with an orbital period of $7.7~ \rm minutes$, in which a low-mass white dwarf transfers the material onto a BH in a short-term mass transfer episode, producing an X-ray luminosity of $10^{38}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. We also obtain an initial parameter space of BH-MS binaries as the progenitors of Seq.1 in the donor-star masses and orbital periods plane, which can be applied to future population synthesis simulations. If Seq.1 is indeed a BH UCXB, future spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detectors can detect the low-frequency GW signals from this source, and a tidal disruption event will be expected after 0.12 Myr.</description>

      <title>Solar-cycle Variability of Composite Geometry in the Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composite geometry and spectral anisotropy of the solar wind turbulence are very important topics in the investigations of solar wind. In this work, we use the magnetic field and plasma data from Wind spacecraft measured during 1995 January to 2023 December, which covers more than two solar cycles, to systematically investigate these subjects in the context of solar-cycle variability. The so-called spectrum ratio test and spectrum anisotropy test are employed to determine the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the solar wind turbulence. Both the tests reveal that the solar wind turbulence is dominated by the two-dimensional (2D) component (~80% by turbulence energy). More interestingly, we find that the fraction of slab turbulence increases with the rising sunspot number, and the correlation coefficient between the slab fraction and the sunspot number is 0.61 (ratio test result) or 0.65 (anisotropy test result). This phenomenon suggests that the increasing solar activity (signified by sunspot number) causes increasing slab component in the solar wind turbulence. The relationship between spectral anisotropy and solar activity is discussed and explained. The enhancement of slab fraction is associated with the intensified interplanetary magnetic field magnitude and the increased Alfven speed during the rise phases of the solar cycles. Our findings will be very helpful for achieving a better understanding of the 3D composite geometry and spectral anisotropy of the solar wind turbulence, and especially of their solar-cycle variability.</description>

      <title>Correlation between U/Th and Pb/Os abundance ratios and its application in nuclear cosmochronology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance ratios of radioactive elements U/Th and stable elements Pb/Os from the $r$-process are found to have a strong correlation. This correlation is quite robust with respect to astrophysical conditions. The U/Th-Pb/Os correlation is then applied to provide customized initial abundance ratios U/Th from the observed abundance ratios Pb/Os for six $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars respectively. Ages of these six metal-poor stars are predicted by the U/Th chronometer, which are approximately between $11$ and $15$ Gyr. Their ages are compatible with the cosmic age of 13.8 billion years predicted from the cosmic microwave background radiation.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXV. A potential new molecular outflow in [BHB2007] 11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the early stages of star formation, accretion processes such as infall from the envelope and molecular streamers, and ejection of matter through winds and jets take place simultaneously. The Class 0/I binary [BHB2007] 11 shows evidence for accretion and ejection at the scales of the circumbinary disk and the inner close binary. Recent H$_2$CO observations showed two elongated structures with hints of outflowing motion almost perpendicular to the main CO outflow, which is launched from the circumbinary disk. With the aim of verifying the nature of these elongated structures, we analyze the line emission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ and SiO observed with ALMA within the Large Program FAUST. These molecules trace material moving at velocities close to the ambient cloud velocity. The images of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ show the elongated structures, whose gas kinematics are consistent with outflowing motions and with rotation in the opposite sense to the main CO outflow. The derived mass loss rate from these large-scale structures is $(1.8\pm0.5)\times10^{-6}M_{\odot}\textrm{ yr}^{-1}$, in agreement with those measured in outflows driven by Class 0/I protostars. The SiO image reveals compact emission close to the binary system, with a slight elongation aligned with the larger-scale structures. This suggests that SiO is released from the sputtering of dust grains in the shocked material at the base of the potential new outflow, with a relative abundance of $\geq(0.11-2.0)\times10^{-9}$. However, higher angular and spectral resolution observations are needed to accurately estimate the outflow launching radius and its powering source. Given the location and the abundance of the SiO emission, we propose that the second outflow may be launched from inside the circumbinary disk, likely by the less massive companion, which is actively accreting material from its surroundings.</description>

      <title>Weighing The Options: The Unseen Companion in LAMOST J2354 is Likely a Massive White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LAMOST J235456.73+335625 (J2354) is a binary system hosting a $\sim 0.7~\rm M_\odot$ K dwarf and a $\sim 1.4~\rm M_\odot$ dark companion, supposedly a neutron star, in a 0.48d orbit. Here we present high- and low-resolution spectroscopy to better constrain the properties of the system. The low-resolution spectrum confirms that the luminous star is a slightly metal-poor K dwarf and strengthens the limits on any optical flux from the dimmer companion. We use the high-resolution spectra to measure atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_{\rm rot}\sin i$) and abundances for 8 elements for the K dwarf. We refine the mass of the compact object to $M_{\rm co} \sim 1.3~\rm M_\odot$ with a minimum mass of $M_{\rm co, min} = 1.23\pm0.04~\rm M_\odot$. The expected overabundance of intermediate-mass elements from the incident supernova ejecta is not detected in the K-dwarf atmosphere. This contrasts with known binaries hosting neutron stars where almost all companions show evidence for polluting material. Moving the neutron-star progenitor further from the K-dwarf at the time of explosion to minimize atmospheric pollution requires a finely-tuned kick to produce the current orbital separation of $\sim 3.3~\rm R_\odot$. Instead, we find that a massive white dwarf with a cooling age of $\gtrsim 3~$Gyr satisfies all observational constraints. The system likely experienced two common-envelope phases leading to its current state because the white dwarf progenitor was massive enough to ignite He-shell burning. The system will become a cataclysmic variable in the distant future when the K-dwarf evolves off of the main sequence. These short-period high-$q$ binaries represent an intriguing formation pathway for compact double white dwarf binaries and thermonuclear supernovae. An ultraviolet spectrum is the most promising avenue for directly detecting the white dwarf companion.</description>

      <title>Red Giant Winds Driven by Alfv\'en Waves with Magnetic Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the driving mechanism of Alfv\'en wave-driven stellar winds from red giant stars, Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boo; K1.5 III) and Aldebaran ($\alpha$ Tau; K5 III), with nonideal MHD simulations in 1D super-radially open flux tubes. Since the atmosphere is not fully ionized, upward propagating Alfv\'enic waves excited by surface convection are affected by ambipolar diffusion. Our fiducial run with the nonideal MHD effect for $\alpha$ Boo gives a time-averaged mass-loss rate, $\dot{M}=3.3\times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$/yr, which is more than one order of magnitude reduced from the result in the ideal MHD run and nicely explains the observational value. Magnetized hot bubbles with $T\gtrsim 10^6$ K are occasionally present simultaneously with cool gas with a few $10^3$ K in the atmosphere because of the thermal instability triggered by radiative cooling; there coexist fully ionized plasma emitting soft X-rays and molecules absorbing/emitting infrared radiations. The inhomogeneity in the atmosphere also causes large temporal variations in $\dot{M}$ within an individual magnetic flux tube. We also study the effect of magnetic field strength and metallicity, and find that the wind density, and accordingly the mass-loss rate, positively and sensitively depends on both of them through the ambipolar diffusion of Alfv\'enic waves. The nonideal MHD simulation for $\alpha$ Tau, which is slightly more evolved than $\alpha$ Boo and has weaker magnetic field, results in weaker wind with $\dot{M}=1.5\times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$/yr with $T\lesssim 10^5$ K throughout the simulation time. However, given the observations implying the presence of locally strong magnetic fields on the surface of $\alpha$ Tau, we also conduct a simulation with a field strength twice as strong. This results in $\dot{M}=2.0\times 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$/yr - comparable to the observed value - with transient magnetized hot bubbles.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2002-BLG-360: a dusty anomaly among red nova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OGLE-2002-BLG-360 is an example of a Galactic red nova, the aftermath of a non-compact stellar merger. The dusty nature of the circumstellar environment makes observations of this particular source difficult, meaning the properties of the central star and its surrounding environment are poorly understood. We aim to establish the parameters of the merger remnant, as well as of the dusty environment and its structure. We attempt to establish similarities with other Galactic red novae and try to understand how such an environment has been formed. We use optical, infrared, and sub-millimetre observations to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) between 2 um and 1.27 mm for an epoch 15-21 years after the red nova eruption. We use the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code to model the SED and retrieve the physical properties of both the central star and the surrounding dust. We show that the SED is best replicated by a spherically symmetric model consisting of an M-type supergiant surrounded by 0.012 Msun of dust concentrated within two spherical shells. The dust extends out to a maximum distance of 9500 AU from the central source, whilst the inner shell extends out to 1000 AU. The dust composition is dominated by iron grains (58%), but also contains olivine silicates (25%) and alumina dust (17%), which are both required to reproduce the profile of the observed 10 um absorption feature. The inner shell likely originates from merger and post-merger ejecta, whilst the outer shell consists of material lost much earlier, before the merger event occurred. Evolution of the SED indicates continued dust formation within the expanding inner shell, which may be analogous to winds of red supergiants. The object is extremely dusty compared to other red nova remnants.</description>

Abstract: Detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets is a key goal of exoplanetary astronomy, one that may now be within reach given the upcoming campaign to conduct a large-scale survey of rocky M-dwarf worlds with the James Webb Space Telescope. It is imperative that we understand where known planets sit relative to the cosmic shoreline, the boundary between planets that have retained atmospheres and those that have not. Previous works modeled the historic XUV radiation received by mid-to-late M-dwarf planets using a scaling relation calibrated using more massive stars, but fully convective M dwarfs display unique rotation/activity histories that differ from Sun-like stars and early M dwarfs. We synthesize observations of the active lifetimes of mid-to-late M dwarfs to present an updated estimate of their historic XUV fluence. For known planets of inactive, mid-to-late M dwarfs, we calculate a historic XUV fluence that is 2.1-3.1 times the canonical XUV scaling relation on average, with the larger value including corrections for the pre-main-sequence phase and energetic flares. We find that only the largest terrestrial planets known to orbit mid-to-late M-dwarfs are likely to have retained atmospheres within the cosmic shoreline paradigm. Our calculations may help to guide the selection of targets for JWST and may prove useful in interpreting the results; to this end, we define a novel Atmosphere Retention Metric (ARM) that indicates the distance between a planet and the cosmic shoreline, and tabulate the ARM for known mid-to-late M-dwarf planets.</description>
