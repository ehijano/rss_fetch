      <title>BlackTHUNDER: evidence for three massive black holes in a z~5 galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observational evidence for three massive, accreting black holes in the $z=5.0167$ galaxy J0148-4214 from JWST/NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy. The black holes are revealed through broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM = 430-2920 km/s) without a forbidden-line counterpart in the bright [O III] doublet. Channel maps of the asymmetric central H$\alpha$ profile isolate two spatially distinct broad line regions (BLRs), separated by $190\pm40$ pc, while a third BLR is found in the galaxy outskirts with a projected separation of 1.7 kpc. Using single-epoch virial relations, we estimate black hole masses of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)=7.9\pm0.4$ (primary central), $5.8\pm0.5$ (secondary central) and $6.3\pm0.5$ (third off-nuclear). We argue that the two central black holes will likely rapidly merge, with a simple dynamical friction time estimate of the order of 700 Myr. Assuming that also the off-nuclear black hole is in the process of sinking towards the centre, it will likely lead to a second merger, and we investigate the detection probability of such mergers with LISA. Alternatively, the third black hole may be the result of previous three-body interaction or a gravitational recoil, where our observations would provide evidence that such black holes may retain their accretion discs and BLRs even in the aftermath of such extreme dynamical interactions. The discovery of a black hole triplet at high redshift, together with other recent results on distant black hole pairs, indicates that multiple massive black hole systems were common in the early Universe. Our results highlight the importance of IFU observations for the detection of massive black hole multiplets in distant galaxies, the progenitors of massive black hole mergers that may be detected with next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>First results from ALPPS: a sub-Alfv\'enic streamer in SVS13A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results from the ALMA Perseus Polarization Survey (ALPPS), focusing on the magnetic field in the SVS13A circumbinary disk. The dataset includes full-Stokes dust continuum observations at $\sim0\farcs3$ and 870 $\mu$m, as well as molecular line emission from C$^{17}$O$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs3$, C$^{18}$O$(J=2 \rightarrow 1)$ at $\sim0\farcs2$, and DCN$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs1$ angular resolution. Our observations resolve both a previously identified dust spiral and an infalling streamer, capturing their spatial and kinematic structures. The streamer is traced from scales $&gt;300$ au down to the circumbinary disk. Using alignment measure (AM) maps and histograms that compare the orientations of the plane-of-sky magnetic field with local intensity and velocity gradients, we find that the AM distribution peaks at a value of 1. This AM peak strongly suggests alignment between the field and the dust total intensity emission, as well as between the field and the gas velocity, which in turn suggests grain alignment by magnetic fields. From our data, we derive a magnetic field strength, B$_{\mathrm{pos}} \sim 1.1 \pm 0.6$\, mG, and a kinetic to magnetic energy ratio of $0.5 \pm 0.4$, suggesting magnetic dominance. We also produced a map of the Alfv\'enic Mach number, finding $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A} &lt; 1$ along the streamer, consistent with sub-Alfv\'enic infalling motions. Therefore, the field is likely facilitating the inflow of material from the envelope onto the disk by constraining movement across the field lines. This represents the first detection of a magnetically sub-Alfv\'enic infalling streamer in a protostellar system.</description>

      <title>Mapping CO Ice in a Star-Forming Filament in the 3 kpc Arm with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO gas emission is a fundamental tool for measuring column density, but in cold, dark clouds, much of the CO is locked away in ice. We present JWST results from observations of a star forming filament (G0.342+0.024) that that appears to be associated with the 3 kpc arm. This filament is backlit by the Galactic Center, which has allowed us to construct a high-resolution extinction map (mean separation between stars of ~1" outside the filament, ~2" in the filament). ALMA Band 3 data reveals embedded star formation within the cloud. Using the CO ice feature covered by the F466N band, we map the CO ice column density of the filament. By combining the extinction map, CO ice column density map, and archival CO observations, we examine the efficacy of standard CO X-factor measurements of mass in star forming gas.We find that 50-88% of the CO is locked away in ice at large column densities ($N_{\rm \rm H_2} \gtrsim 10^{22} \rm ~cm^{-2}, 200 \rm ~M_{\odot} \rm ~pc^{-2}$) in the filament. The primary sources of uncertainty in this estimate are due to uncertainty in the ice composition and lab measurements of ice opacities. This shows that systematic corrections are needed for mass measurements in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies at high column densities.</description>

      <title>The Draco Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy in the First Year of DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial distribution, kinematics, and metallicity of stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We identify 155 high probability members of Draco using line of sight velocity and metallicity information derived from DESI spectroscopy along with {\it Gaia} DR3 proper motions. We find a mean line of sight velocity of $ -290.62\pm0.80$ km s$^{-1}$ with dispersion = $9.57^{+0.66}_{-0.62}$ km s$^{-1}$ and mean metallicity $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ = $-2.10\pm0.04$, consistent with previous results. We also find that Draco has a steep metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and a metallicity gradient that flattens beyond the half-light radius. We identify eight high probability members outside the King tidal radius, four of which we identify for the first time. These extra-tidal stars are not preferentially aligned along the orbit of Draco. We compute an average surface brightness of 34.02 mag $\rm arcsec^{-2}$ within an elliptical annulus from the King tidal radius of 48.1 arcmin to 81 arcmin.</description>

      <title>The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: Influence of Mergers on Radial Profiles of Star-Formation Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate how the merging process influences the radial variations of the specific Star Formation Rate (sSFR), Star Formation Efficiency (SFE), and molecular gas fraction (fmol ) in galaxies. We analyse 33 isolated galaxies and 34 galaxies in four different merger stages from pairs, merging galaxies, post-mergers, and merger remnants. Our sample is included in the EDGE-CALIFA survey, which provides spatially resolved optical integral-field unit and CO spectroscopy data. We show that, in comparison with the isolated sample, the mergers increase the molecular gas fraction non-uniformly across different galactocentric distances. Also, we find that the main driver (efficiency or molecular gas) of both enhanced and suppressed star formation changes independently of galactocentric radius and merger stage. However, efficiency appears to be the primary driver of variations in star formation (except during the merging stage), where we find an enhancement in star formation driven by the available fuel. Our results suggest that in interacting and merging galaxies, the efficiency plays a crucial role in the star formation variations throughout the galaxy, regardless of the available molecular gas content.</description>

      <title>Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT): A Nearly Unbiased Approach to Constraining Optical Variability Dependence on Physical Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit stochastic optical variability, commonly characterized by a damped random walk. The damping timescale is of particular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the central black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the systematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited observational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all available data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria to avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range of AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the underlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we introduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and leverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements. Rather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT robustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN physical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness using mock light curves and show that it successfully reconciles previous inconsistent results based on two independent AGN samples. Our BADDAT method will have broad applications in AGN variability studies during the era of time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Origin of gas in the Magellanic Bridge: MeerKAT detection of HI 21-cm absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HI 21-cm absorption lines are investigated to determine the origin of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) of the Magellanic Bridge (MB). Using the MeerKat Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data we report the detection of an HI absorption line at a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 10 caused by MB gas against the radio source J033242.97-724904.5. In combination with earlier data obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) our new detected HI line permits the exploration of the MB atomic hydrogen gas across 4-6 kpc. The radial velocity profiles from the ATCA data and new data from MALS are analysed. Apart from the excitation conditions, the radial velocity structure of the HI gas seen in emission and absorption is investigated. Eventually the gas-to-dust ratio is quantified to identify the origin of the MB gas being either from the SMC (Small Magellanic Cloud) or the LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). The HI absorption lines towards lines of sight separated by several kpc consistently coincide with the densest and perhaps coolest gas at the lower radial-velocity limit of the corresponding HI emission profiles. The gas-to-dust ratio is found to be consistent with an origin of the MB gas from the LMC. The large scale velocity distribution as seen from the HI absorption features favors the LMC-SMC direct collision scenario over the close fly-by scenario, as also currently found by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Mass stratification in the globular cluster system revealing the assembly history of the nearest S0 galaxy NGC 3115</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy formation and evolution is hierarchical. The most massive galaxies are thought to form their central regions early through violent dissipational processes, then grow inside-out by accreting smaller satellites. While widely supported, direct observational confirmation of this process in individual galaxies remains lacking, except for the Milky Way. We present a detailed analysis of globular cluster (GC) candidates within a $70^\prime$ ($\sim190$ kpc) radius around the nearest S0 galaxy, NGC 3115, using images in \textit{g,r,z} bands from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and data from Gaia. We report the discovery of mass stratification in the GC system (GCS), evident in two ways: first, the effective radius of the GCS increases monotonically from the bright to faint end, up to the detection limit near the turnover magnitude of the GC luminosity function (GCLF); second, the GCLF shows fainter turnover magnitudes and smaller standard deviations at larger galactocentric radii. This stratification cannot be readily explained by radial migration or tidal dissolution, but most likely reflects the hierarchical assembly of NGC 3115's stellar halo, with later-accreted satellites deposited across broader galactocentric distances. This interpretation is supported by cosmological simulations of subhalos with comparable mass and bulge-to-total mass ratios and is consistent with the negative color gradients observed in the GCS. Additionally, we identify several substructures within the GCS, indicating ongoing assembly of NGC 3115. This work highlights the power of GCS as tracers of galaxy assembly and sets the stage for upcoming space-based wide-field imaging surveys to constrain the assembly of massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>High-redshift Merger-induced Bar-like Galaxies in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries made with JWST observations include a significant number of barred galaxies at high redshift. Their origin remains unclear and their presence seems difficult to reproduce in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. In this Letter I present four examples of high-redshift bars selected from a sample of bar-like galaxies studied previously using IllustrisTNG simulations. All the galaxies formed their bars at redshifts z &gt; 3 via mergers with smaller satellites, although one had its bar formed even earlier, at z &gt; 5. The bars were born long, with lengths on the order of 3 kpc, and grew in time. Three of the four galaxies were later accreted by clusters and underwent multiple interactions with their respective brightest cluster galaxies. Their bar strength was to some extent affected by these interactions but all the galaxies preserved their bar-like shape until the present time. By the end of the evolution, all the galaxies lost their gas and stopped forming stars, they retained essentially no disk component and were no longer rotationally supported. The examples demonstrate that high-z bars do not evolve into present-day barred disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way but rather into S0s or ellipticals typically found in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshift Forecast for 7-Dimensional Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the expected accuracy of redshifts that can be obtained using low-resolution spectroscopic (medium-band) data from the 7-Dimensional Sky Survey (7DS). By leveraging 40 densely sampled filters with widths of full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 25 nm, we create 7DS mock catalogs and estimate the redshift accuracy for three 7DS main surveys: Wide-field Time-Domain Survey (WTS), Intensive Monitoring Survey (IMS), and Reference Image Survey (RIS). Using photometric redshifts calculated from EAZY, we find that the five-year WTS provides reliable photometric redshifts with an normalized median absolute deviation (${\sigma}_{\text{NMAD}}$) ranging from 0.003 to 0.007 and a catastrophic failure fraction ({\eta}) from 0.8% to 8.1% at $19 \leq m_{625}$ &lt; 22$. The spectral resolution R ~ 50 of the medium-band dataset effectively captures the 4000 {\AA} break and various emission lines. We also explore the synergy with data obtained from Pan-STARRS1, VIKING, and SPHEREx surveys. Combining the SPHEREx all-sky data with WTS significantly improves the accuracy of photometric redshift estimates, achieving {\eta} = 0.4% and ${\sigma}_{\text{NMAD}}$ = 0.004 for fainter sources at higher redshifts. The additional near-IR information provided by SPHEREx and VIKING plays an essential role in resolving degeneracies between low and high redshifts. We also observe color excesses by subtracting adjacent broad-band data, which improves the confinement of photometric redshifts and aids in the detection of strong emission line galaxies.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic filaments on the abundance of satellite galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$--$95 \%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.</description>

Abstract: Context. Recent Monte Carlo simulations and laboratory studies of interstellar ices have proposed an alternative pathway involving the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction reaction in the overall mechanism of methanol (CH3OH) formation in dark molecular clouds. Aims. A computational study was conducted to investigate the contribution of the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route in CH3OH formation in interstellar ices, both in non-shocked and shocked environments, and to examine how the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) affect the overall CH3OH synthesis pathway. Methods. A set of chemical models were ran using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM to systematically explore methanol synthesis in various physical scenarios, including non-shock and low- and high-velocity C-shocks. Results. This work demonstrated for the first time that, under non-shock and shocked-influenced environments, the primary reaction leading to the formation of methanol in the inner layers of interstellar ices is indeed the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route. However, such route is dependent on the gas kinetic temperature (Tk), gas volume density (nH2 ), velocity of the C-shock wave (vshock), and cosmic ray ionisation rate ({\zeta}). Furthermore, gaseous formaldehyde may trace C-type shocks and serve to differentiate methanol formation pathways in low-velocity C-shocked environments, as its abundance varies more significantly than that of CH3OH with the inclusion of the H-atom abstraction reaction in UCLCHEM. The H2CO/CH3OH ratio thus represents a potential diagnostic tool for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn -- morphological classifications for over 41,000 galaxies in the Euclid Deep Field North from the Hawaii Two-0 Cosmic Dawn survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present morphological classifications of over 41,000 galaxies out to $z_{\rm phot}\sim2.5$ across six square degrees of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDFN) from the Hawaii Twenty Square Degree (H20) survey, a part of the wider Cosmic Dawn survey. Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists play a crucial role in the examination of large astronomical data sets through crowdsourced data mining of extragalactic imaging. This iteration, Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn (GZCD), saw tens of thousands of volunteers and the deep learning foundation model Zoobot collectively classify objects in ultra-deep multiband Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging down to a depth of $m_{HSC-i} = 21.5$. Here, we present the details and general analysis of this iteration, including the use of Zoobot in an active learning cycle to improve both model performance and volunteer experience, as well as the discovery of 51 new gravitational lenses in the EDFN. We also announce the public data release of the classifications for over 45,000 subjects, including more than 41,000 galaxies (median $z_{\rm phot}$ of $0.42\pm0.23$), along with their associated image cutouts. This data set provides a valuable opportunity for follow-up imaging of objects in the EDFN as well as acting as a truth set for training deep learning models for application to ground-based surveys like that of the newly operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Searching for Corannulene with ALMA: Observations of the Red Rectangle Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules responsible for the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), observed across a multitude of astrophysical environments. Despite their ubiquity, the precise formation mechanisms of PAHs remain unclear. One of the possible way for PAHs to form is in the outflows of evolved stars, such as HD 44179, which produces the Red Rectangle nebula - a known emitter of AIBs. However, no specific PAH molecules have been detected in such environments, complicating the understanding of PAH formation and evolution. This study aimed to detect the PAH molecule corannulene C20H10, a viable candidate for radio detection due to its large dipole moment of 2.07D. We analyzed high-resolution band 4 ALMA observations of the Red Rectangle nebula, collected over almost 9 hrs. Although corannulene emission was not detected, we estimated a firm upper limit on its abundance compared to hydrogen (5x10^-13) and we discuss the lack of detection in the context of our current understanding of PAH formation and destruction mechanisms. Additionally, we report tentative detection of signals at 139.612 GHz, 139.617 GHz, and 139.621 GHz, potentially originating from cyclopropenyledine c-C3H2 and the 140 GHz H2O maser.</description>

      <title>The Diamond Ring in Cygnus X: Advanced stage of an expanding bubble of ionised carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Diamond Ring" in Cygnus X, southwest of the DR21 ridge, is a nearly circular structure of $\sim$6 pc in diameter, prominent in FIR emission and enclosed by clumpy molecular clouds traced in CO. It hosts an HII region, visible in cm emission, and resembles a classical expanding HII bubble routinely seen in the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line. However, SOFIA FEEDBACK observations in the spectrally resolved [CII] line reveal instead a slightly tilted ring of $\sim$10$^3$ M$_\odot$ expanding slowly at $\sim$1.3 km s$^{-1}$, with a bulk line-of-sight (LOS) velocity near $-2$ km s$^{-1}$. The central "Diamond" is an unrelated dense clump at $\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$. The driving source, classified from IR spectroscopy, is a B0.5e star that powers the HII region. Unlike typical 3D shells, this marks the first case where we detect only a slowly expanding CII ring. We suggest the HII region and CII bubble, initially formed by a massive star, expanded outward from a flat slab of molecular gas nearly in the plane of the sky. The ring is now confined by swept-up material of the slab, while shell components moving perpendicular to the LOS have dissipated, leading to a reduction in expansion. Dedicated simulations tracing the evolution of the CII bubble support this geometry, consistent with previous reports of HII region evolution in flat molecular clouds. We propose that the "Diamond Ring" represents the terminal phase of an expanding CII bubble driven by stellar winds and thermal pressure.</description>

      <title>SDSS-C4 3028: The Nearest Blue Galaxy Cluster Devoid of an Intracluster Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SDSS-C4 3028 is a galaxy cluster at $z=0.061$, notable for its unusually high fraction of star-forming galaxies with 19 star-forming and 11 quiescent spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies. From Subaru/HSC imaging, we derived a weak lensing mass of $M_{200} = (1.3 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, indicating a low-mass cluster. This is in excellent agreement with its dynamical mass of $M_{200} = (1.0\pm0.4)\times10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, derived from SDSS spectroscopic data. XMM-Newton observations reveal that its X-ray emission is uniform and fully consistent with the astrophysical X-ray background, with no evidence for an intracluster medium (ICM). The 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $L_{\rm X}(0.1-2.4\rm keV)=7.7\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ on the cluster's X-ray luminosity falls below the value expected from the $L_{\rm X}-M_{\rm halo}$ scaling relation of nearby galaxy clusters. We derived star-formation histories for its member galaxies using the photometric spectral energy distribution from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE data. Most of its quiescent galaxies reside within the central 300 kpc, while star-forming ones dominate the outer region (300 kpc - 1 Mpc). The core region has formed the bulk of its stellar mass approximately 1.5 Gyr earlier than the outskirts. We infer a long quenching time of $&gt;3$ Gyr for its quiescent galaxies, consistent with slow quenching mechanisms such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or strangulation. These findings suggest that SDSS-C4 3028 may have undergone an "inside-out" formation and quenching process. Its ICM may have been expelled by intense AGN feedback after core formation but before full cluster assembly. The high fraction ($\sim$0.63) of star-forming members likely results from the absence of ram pressure stripping in this blue cluster, supporting the important role of ram pressure stripping in quenching galaxies in clusters.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Distance Measurements to the Smith Cloud with SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High velocity clouds supply the Milky Way with gas that sustains star formation over cosmic timescales. Precise distance measurements are therefore essential to quantify their mass inflow rates and gauge their exact contribution to the Galaxy's gas supply. We use a sample of 1,293 SDSS-V BOSS stellar spectra within 10 degrees of the high-velocity Smith Cloud (SC) to trace Na I absorption and dust extinction as functions of distance. By fitting ISM-corrected MaStar templates to each spectrum, we isolate residual equivalent widths and extinction then compare trends in the SC region to a same-latitude control field. Stars beyond 1 kpc toward the SC exhibit a significant Na I equivalent width excess ($&gt;$0.1 Angstroms, $&gt;$3sigma) relative to the control. Joint fits of Na I equivalent width and Av against both low and high-velocity H I column densities show that the low-velocity component is strongly correlated with both quantities, while the high-velocity term is marginally significant in extinction and consistent with zero in Na I, consistent with a patchy, low dust-to-gas ratio. Given that the excess Na I begins at distances $&lt;2$ kpc uniquely in the direction of the Cloud, and previous estimates of the SC place it at 12.4 $\pm$ 1.3 kpc, further investigation of its distance is warranted.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit on the Non-Gravitational Acceleration and Lower Limits on the Nucleus Mass and Diameter of 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use astrometric data on 3I/ATLAS compiled by the Minor Planet Center from May 15 to September 23, 2025, and derive an upper limit on any statistically significant deviation from the best-fit gravity-based trajectory. The residuals imply that the non-gravitational acceleration is smaller than $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10}\,{\rm au\,d^{-2}}$. Based on the total mass-loss rate and outflow speed inferred from JWST data on August 6, 2025, we derive lower limits on the mass and diameter of 3I/ATLAS of $3.3 \times 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ and $5\,{\rm km}$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An international conference Radio Stars in the Era of New Observatories was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory on 2024 April 17-19. The conference brought together more than 60 researchers from around the world, united by an interest in using radio wavelength observations to explore the physical processes that operate in stars (including the Sun), how stars evolve and interact with their environments, and the role of radio stars as probes of our Galaxy. Topics discussed at the meeting included radio emission from cool and ultracool dwarfs, extrasolar space weather, stellar masers, thermal radio emission from evolved stars, circumstellar chemistry, low frequency observations of the Sun, radio emission from hot stars, applications of very long baseline interferometry techniques to stellar astrophysics, stellar explosive events, the detection of radio stars in the latest generation of widefield sky surveys, the importance of radio stars for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way, and the anticipated applications for stellar astrophysics of future radio observatories on the ground and in space. This article summarizes research topics and results featured at the conference, along with some background and contextual information. It also highlights key outstanding questions in stellar astrophysics where new insights are anticipated from the next generation of observational facilities operating at meter through submillimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Obscured Accretion in the Local Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), especially Compton-thick sources with line-of-sight column density ($N_{\rm H,los}$) $&gt;$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, are critical to understanding supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and the origin of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). However, their observed fraction remains significantly below model predictions, due to strong absorption bias, even in the hard X-ray (i.e., above 10 keV) band. We analyze a sample of 26 nearby ($z &lt; 0.1$) AGN from the Swift-BAT 150-month catalog, selected via mid-IR to X-ray diagnostics and observed with NuSTAR and soft X-ray telescopes (Xmm-Newton, Chandra, or Swift-xrt). Using self-consistent torus models (MyTorus, Borus02, and UXCLUMPY), we aim to constrain $N_{\rm H,los}$, the average torus column density, and other geometrical parameters of the obscuring medium. A comparative analysis among the three torus models showed that while estimates of $N_{\rm{H,los}}$ were generally in agreement, Borus02 tended to classify a slightly larger number of sources as Compton-thick AGN (CT-AGN). Building on this comparison, we benchmark two prediction schemes -- a mid-IR/X-ray relation and a machine-learning model -- against our broadband best-fit $N_{\rm H,los}$ measurements to assess which approach more effectively bridges the gap between predicted and measured obscuration, finding that while the former works effectively in the heavily obscured region (log$\rm{N_H} \gtrsim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$), the latter provides improved accuracy, particularly for Compton-thin to moderately thick regimes (log$\rm{N_H} \lesssim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$).</description>

      <title>A nearly pristine star from the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first stars formed out of pristine gas, causing them to be so massive that none are expected to have survived until today. If their direct descendants were sufficiently low-mass stars, they could exist today and would be recognizable by having the lowest metallicity (abundance of elements heavier than helium). The lowest metallicity star currently known is a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way with total metallicity Z &lt; 1.4 x 10^-6 (log Z/Zsun &lt; -4.0). While other stars with lower iron abundance have been discovered, they have high carbon abundances and thus higher total metallicities (log Z/Zsun &gt; -3). Here we present the discovery and detailed chemical analysis of the most metal-poor star yet found: the red giant star SDSS J0715-7334 with ultra-low abundances of both iron and carbon ([Fe/H]=-4.3, [C/Fe]&lt;-0.2), resulting in total metallicity Z &lt; 7.8 x 10^-7 (log Z/Zsun &lt; -4.3). This star has the most pristine composition of any object known in the universe. The star's orbit indicates that it originates from the halo of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its detailed chemical composition implies a supernova progenitor with initial mass of 30 solar masses. Current models of low-mass star formation can explain the existence of SDSS J0715-7334 only if dust cooling was already able to operate at the time of its formation. SDSS J0715-7334 is over ten times more metal-poor than the most metal-poor high-redshift galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope, some of which have been claimed to be potentially metal-free. Substantially deeper observations of high-redshift galaxies would be needed to prove that they are truly pristine galaxies made of metal-free stars and not metal-enriched galaxies composed of second-generation stars like SDSS J0715-7334.</description>

      <title>BICEP/Keck XX: Component-separated maps of polarized CMB and thermal dust emission using Planck and BICEP/Keck Observations through the 2018 Observing Season</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present component-separated polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Galactic thermal dust emission, derived using data from the BICEP/Keck experiments through the 2018 observing season and Planck. By employing a maximum-likelihood method that utilizes observing matrices, we produce unbiased maps of the CMB and dust signals. We outline the computational challenges and demonstrate an efficient implementation of the component map estimator. We show methods to compute and characterize power spectra of these maps, opening up an alternative way to infer the tensor-to-scalar ratio from our data. We compare the results of this map-based separation method with the baseline BICEP/Keck analysis. Our analysis demonstrates consistency between the two methods, finding an 84% correlation between the pipelines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a class of radially pulsating stars with effective temperatures ranging from 20,000 to 35,000 K and pulsation periods between 7 and 75 minutes. This study utilizes the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code to investigate helium-burning stars as a formation channel for BLAPs in the Milky Way. The progenitor stars have initial masses of 3-6 $M_{\odot}$, resulting in BLAPs with final masses of 0.5-1.2 $M_{\odot}$. Based on a constant star formation rate of 3 $ M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$ and solar metallicity (Z = 0.020), population synthesis predicts approximately 14,351 helium-burning BLAPs in the Milky Way: 12,799 with Main Sequence (MS) companions and 1,551 with evolved/compact-object companions. Helium-burning BLAPs show prolonged lifetimes in the pulsation region and a narrow stellar age range for entering this regime (log(t/yr) = 8.0-8.6), unlike pre-white dwarf models. BLAPs with MS companions typically form via Roche lobe overflow, leading to longer orbital periods ($\sim$100 days). Those with evolved/compact-object companions form through common envelope evolution, resulting in shorter periods. While Galactic extinction makes most BLAPs faint (apparent magnitudes $&gt;$ 25), future surveys like WFST and VRO LSST are expected to detect approximately 500-900. This research establishes helium-burning stars as a significant BLAP contributor and offers testable predictions regarding their binary properties and Galactic distribution.</description>

      <title>Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z&gt;6 JWST Results? CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in Near Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts ($z &gt; 6$) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $6.2\sigma$ (and $17.4\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.</description>

      <title>Fermi detection of $\gamma$-rays from the radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy NGC 3281</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of significant $\gamma$-ray emission with $\it Fermi$-LAT from the radio-quiet Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3281, with a luminosity of $5.9\,(\pm 1.7)\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at a significance of $6.22\,\sigma$ (TS = $42.81$). The power-law photon index is $2.61~(\pm 0.24)$, indicative of a soft spectrum. The star formation activity in NGC 3281 is insufficient to explain its $\gamma$-ray luminosity based on the empirical relation between the infrared and $\gamma$-ray luminosities observed in other sources. The multiwavelength spectrum can be explained as due to inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons in the corona or jet of seed photons from the corona, disk and torus. The source is Compton-thick and attenuation of GeV photons due to pair production in the corona is nonnegligible (with an optical depth of about 10). The intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity is inferred to be $3.4\,\times10^{42}$ and $2.2\,\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ for the corona and jet model, respectively. The observed $\gamma$-ray and radio luminosities is roughly consistent with the known correlation between the two quantities, among the lowest luminosity regime. The jet origin is valid only if the radio emission is dominated by the jet.</description>

      <title>Vector Resonant Relaxation and Statistical Closure Theory. II. One-loop Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use stellar dynamics as a testbed for statistical closure theory. We focus on the process of "Vector Resonant Relaxation," a long-range, non-linear, and correlated relaxation mechanism that drives the reorientation of stellar orbital planes around a supermassive black hole. This process provides a natural setting to evaluate the predictive power of generic statistical closure schemes for dynamical correlation functions, in the fully non-linear and non-perturbative regime. We develop a numerical scheme that explicitly implements the seminal "Martin-Siggia-Rose" formalism at one-loop order via an iterative fixed-point approach, thereby improving upon the bare order from the "Direct Interaction Approximation." Using this framework, we quantitatively validate the ability of the formalism to predict (i) the two-point two-time correlation function; (ii) the renormalised three-point interaction vertex; (iii) the three-point three-time correlation function. These predictions are compared to direct measurements from numerical simulations. We conclude by discussing the limitations of this approach and presenting possible future venues.</description>

      <title>First direct detection of an RR Lyrae star conclusively associated with an intermediate-age cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars have long been considered unequivocal tracers of old (&gt;10 Gyr) and metal-poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}&lt;-0.5$) stellar populations. First, because these populations are where they are readily found and because, according to canonical stellar evolution models for isolated stars, these are the only populations where RR Lyrae should exist. Recent independent results, however, are challenging this view and pointing at the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae, only a few (2--5) Gyrs old. Our goal in this work is to provide direct evidence of the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae by searching for these stars in Milky Way open clusters, where the age association will be direct and robust. We searched over 3,000 open clusters with published kinematically associated member stars from the Hunt &amp; Reffert database by crossmatching against a compilation of the largest publicly available RR Lyrae surveys (\Gaia, ASAS-SN, PanStarrs1, Zwicky Transient Factory and OGLE-IV).
  We identified a star as a bona fide RR~Lyrae variable and robust member of the 2--4 Gyr old Trumpler 5 cluster, based on its parallax and proper motions and their agreement with confirmed cluster members. We derived an extremely low probability ($0.049\pm 0.013$%) that the star is a background field RR~Lyrae and provide initial constraints on a possible binary companion based on its position in the colour-absolute magnitude diagram. Currently a source of debate, the Trumpler~5 RR Lyrae provides the most direct evidence to date of the existence of RR Lyrae stars at much younger ages than traditionally expected and adds to the mounting evidence supporting their existence.</description>

      <title>Swift Memory Burden in Merging Black Holes: how information load affects black hole's classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we argue that the information load carried by a black hole affects its classical perturbations. We refer to this phenomenon as the ``swift memory burden effect" and show that it is universal for objects of high efficiency of information storage. The effect is expected to have observable manifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in Einstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although degenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The strength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which measures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the information load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of a black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some master formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as on solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect must be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial black holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments. We also provide a proposal for the test of the memory burden phenomenon in a table-top laboratory setting with cold bosons.</description>

      <title>High Proper Motion Discoveries from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the third data release of the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey to locate previously unrecognized high proper motion objects. We identify a total of 127 new discoveries with total proper motions $\gtrsim$300 mas yr$^{-1}$. A significant fraction of these sources with counterparts in the Gaia DR3 catalog are found to be distant ($&gt;$100 pc) low-mass stars, where their large tangential velocities and placement on color-magnitude diagrams suggest that they are likely low-metallicity M-type subdwarfs. Optical spectroscopy is used to confirm the low-mass and low-metallicity for two such sources. Using available optical and infrared photometry, we estimate the spectral type for all non-Gaia sources and find 10 likely late-M dwarfs, 15 objects with colors most consistent with L-type dwarfs, and 9 possible T-type dwarfs. Follow-up spectroscopy is needed to confirm spectral types and further characterize these new discoveries.</description>

      <title>First direct carbon abundance measured at $z&gt;10$ in the lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the metal enrichment in the early universe helps us constrain theories about the first stars and study the ages of galaxies. The lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD at $z=10.17$ is the brightest galaxy known at $z &gt; 10$. Previous work analyzing JWST NIRSpec and MIRI data yielded a direct metallicity $\rm{12+log(O/H)}=7.79\pm0.09$ ($\sim$ 0.13 $Z_\odot$) and electron density $\rm{log}(n_e / \rm{cm^{-3}}) = 2.9 \pm 0.5$, the most distant such measurements to date. Here we estimate the direct C/O abundance for the first time at $z &gt; 10$, finding a sub-solar ${\rm log(C/O)}=-0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. This is higher than other $z&gt;6$ galaxies with direct C/O measurements, likely due to higher metallicity. It is also slightly higher than galaxies in the local universe with similar metallicity. This may suggest a very efficient and rapid burst of star formation, a low effective oxygen abundance yield, or the presence of unusual stellar populations including supermassive stars. Alternatively, the strong CIII]${\rm {\lambda}{\lambda}}$1907,1909 emission ($14\pm 3\,{\r{A}}$ rest-frame EW) may originate from just one of the two component star clusters JDB ($r \sim 20$ pc). Future NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations of MACS0647$-$JD will be promising for disentangling C/O in the two components to constrain the chemistry of individual star clusters just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Extreme Neutral Outflow in a non-AGN Quiescent Galaxy at z$\sim$1.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have discovered a substantial sodium doublet (Na D $\lambda\lambda$5890, 5896\AA)-traced neutral outflow in a quiescent galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at $z=1.317$ in GOODS-S field. Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of $v_{\rm out}=828^{+79}_{-49}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a mass outflow rate of $\log(\dot{M}_{\rm out}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}})=2.40^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$. This outflow rate exceeds that of any neutral outflows identified beyond $z\sim1$ by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with intensive star formation or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the Paschen $\alpha$ (Pa$\alpha$) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism confirms that its star formation rate is low ($\mathrm{SFR_{Pa\alpha}}=10.78\pm 0.55\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$), corresponding to a low specific SFR of -10.2 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, 0.5 dex below the main sequence. The best-fit SED modeling based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam and the VLT/MUSE spectrum, suggests this galaxy has experienced a quiescent period lasting about one Gyr or more while seems to rejuvenate within the recent 10 Myr. Surprisingly, rest-frame optical lines indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is also weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H$\alpha$ line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that this outflow may be a long-lasting fossil one driven by past AGN activity, potentially co-triggered with the early phase of rejuvenation.</description>

      <title>Hot Diggity Dog: Simultaneous CO and Dust Modeling of the Most Luminous WISE Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxy Unveils Extreme Molecular Gas Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), the most infrared (IR) luminous objects selected by the WISE all-sky mid-IR survey, have yielded a sample of intrinsically luminous quasars (QSOs) with obscured nuclear activity and hot dust temperatures. The molecular gas excitation properties have yet to be examined in detail under such extreme conditions. Here we study the most far-IR luminous \textit{WISE} Hot DOG W2246-0526, focusing on ALMA observations of the central host galaxy. Multi-J CO transition measurements at J=2-1, 5-4, 7-6, 12-11, and 17-16 provide the first self-consistent modeling constraints on the molecular gas and dust properties of any WISE Hot DOG to date, providing a benchmark for future studies of dust-obscured QSOs. We implement a state-of-the-art TUrbulent Non-Equilibrium Radiative transfer model (TUNER) that simultaneously models both the line and dust continuum measurements. The extreme CO spectral line energy distribution seems to turnover around the CO(12-11) transition, likely making this among the most highly excited galaxies ever reported. The model infers a molecular gas mass $\sim 8\times10^{10}$\,\Msun, and we conclude that J$\ge$3 CO line luminosities trace the bulk of the molecular gas mass for this extreme system unlike low-excitation conditions calibrated locally. W2246-0526 is a rapidly evolving system, with a high mean value of the molecular gas kinetic temperature versus dust temperature $T_\mathrm{k}$ / $T_\mathrm{d} \sim 4.3$. This may be due to the shocks and outflows injecting kinetic energy within the central kpc of this host that have previously been reported. These signs of highly excited molecular gas in W2246-0526 motivates obtaining well-sampled CO ladders in larger samples to better understand the conditions within these short-lived episodes associated with the most obscured supermassive black hole activity.</description>

      <title>GalSBI-SPS: a stellar population synthesis-based galaxy population model for cosmology and galaxy evolution applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will enable unprecedented tests of the concordance cosmological model and of galaxy formation and evolution. Fully exploiting their potential requires a precise understanding of the selection effects on galaxies and biases on measurements of their properties, required, above all, for accurate estimates of redshift distributions n(z). Forward-modelling offers a powerful framework to simultaneously recover galaxy $n(z)$s and characterise the observed galaxy population. We present GalSBI-SPS, a new SPS-based galaxy population model that generates realistic galaxy catalogues, which we use to forward-model HSC data in the COSMOS field. GalSBI-SPS samples galaxy physical properties, computes magnitudes with ProSpect, and simulates HSC images in the COSMOS field with UFig. We measure photometric properties consistently in real data and simulations. We compare $n(z)$s, photometric and physical properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i&lt;23. Median differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are overestimated by 0.2 arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is comparable to that seen in GalSBI. $n(z)$s show a mild positive offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a Stage-III depth using only literature-based parameters. Its predictive power will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI, thereby providing accurate $n(z)$s satisfying the stringent requirements set by Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy Situation Eased: Cold Dark Matter with Multipoles Can Explain The Double Radio Quad Lens HS 0810+2554</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally observed in isophotal density contours of elliptical galaxies, higher order perturbations in the form of Fourier modes, or multipoles, are becoming increasingly recognized as necessary to account for angular mass complexity in strong lensing analyses. When smooth, elliptical CDM mass models fail, multipoles often emerge as solutions. With the discovery of two radio jets in the source quasar, the strong gravitational lens HS 0810+2554 can no longer be well fit by elliptical mass models, suggesting perturbations on small-scales. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of multipoles $m=1$ (lopsidedness), $m=3$ (triangleness), and $m=4$ (boxiness and diskiness) in addressing the image positional anomalies of the two radio quads of HS 0810+2554. Due to the exact pairing and arrival sequence of the images being unknown, we consider all feasible image configurations. With 64 unique best-fit models, we achieve a fit of $\chi=1.59$ ($\chi^2=2.53$), with $m=1,3,4$ multipole strengths of 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.6%, respectively, with images in the reverse time ordering. Elliptical+shear models from previous works find $\chi\!\sim\!7\!-\!10$, for comparison. With the morphological (i.e., standard) arrival sequence, we achieve a fit of $\chi=2.95$ with two images being assigned to opposite sources. Therefore, CDM mass models with mass complexity in the form of multipoles are able to adequately explain the positional anomalies in HS 0810+2554.

      <title>Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent Galaxies from JWST-SUSPENSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive ($M_*=10^{10.5-11.5}M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.2-2.3$ from the JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10 galaxies show significant rotation ($V_{r_e}=117-345$km/s, $\sigma_0 = 180-387$km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter. The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with other quiescent galaxy samples at $z\sim0.5-2.5$, we find a trend between rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at $z\sim0$, and likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support compared to massive ETGs at $z\sim0$, which are, on average, older. Our kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median $M_{\text{dyn}}/M_*=2.7$); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in the cores of low-$z$ massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs, gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Origins of Hot Halo Gas in Milky Way-Type Galaxies with SMUGGLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current galaxy formation models predict the existence of X-ray-emitting gaseous halos around Milky Way (MW)-type galaxies. To investigate properties of this coronal gas in MW-like galaxies, we analyze a suite of high-resolution simulations based on the SMUGGLE framework and compare the results with X-ray observations of both the MW and external galaxies. We find that for subgrid models incorporating any form of stellar feedback, e.g., early feedback (including stellar winds and radiation) and/or supernova (SN) explosions, the total 0.5-2 keV luminosity is consistent within uncertainties with X-ray observations of the MW and with scaling relations derived for external disk galaxies. However, all models exhibit an X-ray surface brightness profile that declines too steeply beyond $\sim5$ kpc, underpredicting the extended emission seen in recent eROSITA stacking results. Across all subgrid prescriptions, the simulated surface brightness and emission measure fall below MW observations by at least 1-2 orders of magnitude, with the most severe discrepancy occurring in the no-feedback model. Our results suggest that (i) stellar feedback primarily shapes the innermost hot atmosphere (central $\sim5$ kpc), with comparable contributions from early feedback and SNe to the resulting X-ray luminosity; (ii) additional mechanisms such as gravitational heating, active galactic nuclei feedback, and/or Compton effects of GeV cosmic ray are necessary to generate the extended, volume-filling hot gaseous halo of MW-mass galaxies; (iii) the origins of hot corona in MW-like galaxies are partially distinct from those of the warm ($\sim10^5$ K) gas, by combining our previous finding that the SMUGGLE model successfully reproduces the kinematics and spatial distribution of MW O VI absorbers.</description>

      <title>Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &gt; 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) and the faint group (SFR &lt; 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &gt; 0.5, n &gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &lt; 0.35, n &lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge &lt;= 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of a Large Active Wind from the Milky Way's Central Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every large galaxy has a black hole in its center. The interaction between the black hole and their host profoundly shapes galactic evolution and the Universe as a whole. The key feature of this interaction are black hole jets - or more generally winds - which every black hole must have. Despite our Galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), proximity and importance, the active wind from it has eluded scientists for over half a century. Here we report the discovery of a large active wind from Sgr A* using unprecedentedly deep observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect a large conical clearing in the cold molecular gas surrounding Sgr A* that is at least 1 parsec in length and has a 45-degree opening angle. The morphology and energetics of this structure are consistent with active clearing by a hot wind from Sgr A*. This finding resolves the long-standing mystery of the missing wind from Sgr A*, and delivers the most detailed look yet of black hole feeding and feedback processes in our Galactic center.</description>

      <title>A GLIMPSE of Intermediate Mass Black holes in the epoch of reionization: Witnessing the Descendants of Direct Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.</description>

      <title>Innovative SiC ultraviolet instrumentation development with potential applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>The first direct imaging of the silhouette of a damped Lyman $\alpha$ system along the line-of-sight to a background galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The H~{\sc i} gas distribution in damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) has remained elusive due to the point-source nature of background quasar emission. Observing DLAs against spatially extended background galaxies provides a new method for constraining their size and structure. Using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, we present the first ``silhouette'' image of a DLA at $z=3.34$, identified in the spectrum of a background galaxy at $z=3.61$. Although the silhouette remains unresolved due to limited spatial resolution, this represents a successful proof-of-concept for studying DLA morphology using extended background sources. Possible residual emission in the DLA trough suggests an optical depth contrast exceeding $10^7$ in the internal structure, implying a sharp edge or patchy structure. A Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{\rm LAE}=3.3433\pm0.0005$, consistent with the DLA redshift, is detected at an angular separation of $1.''73\pm0.''28$ ($12.9\pm2.1$ kpc). The DLA is surrounded by three galaxies within 140 kpc in projected distance and 500 km s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity, indicating that it resides in the circumgalactic medium of the LAE or within a galaxy group/protocluster environment. An O~{\sc i} $\lambda1302$ absorption at $z_{\rm OI}=3.3288\pm0.0004$ is also detected along the line of sight. This absorber may trace metal-enriched outflow from the LAE or a gas-rich galaxy exhibiting the highest star formation activity among the surrounding galaxies. Future large spectroscopic surveys of galaxies will expand such a DLA sample, and three-dimensional spectroscopy for it will shed new light on the role of intergalactic dense gas in galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a brightest cluster galaxy and lensing properties for the Dragon arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.</description>

      <title>Outflow-cloud interaction as the possible origin of the peculiar radio emission in the tidal disruption event AT2018cqh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of &lt;~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~&gt; 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.</description>
