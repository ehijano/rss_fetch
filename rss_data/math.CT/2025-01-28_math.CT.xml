      <title>L-mosaics and orthomodular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of hypercompositional structures called dualizable L-mosaics. We prove that their category is equivalent to that formed by ortholattices and we formulate an algebraic property characterizing orthomodularity, suggesting possible applications to quantum logic.</description>

      <title>Abstract clones as noncommutative monoids I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clones of functions play a foundational role in both universal algebra and theoretical computer science. In this work, we introduce clone merge monoids (cm-monoids), a unifying one-sorted algebraic framework that integrates abstract clones, clone algebras (previously introduced by the first and the third author), and Neumann's aleph0-abstract clones, while modelling the interplay of infinitary operations. Cm-monoids combine a monoid structure with a new algebraic structure called merge algebra, capturing essential properties of infinite sequences of  operations.We establish a categorical equivalence between clone algebras and finitely-ranked cm-monoids.This equivalence yields by restriction  a three-fold equivalence between abstract clones, finite-dimensional clone algebras, and finite-dimensional, finitely ranked cm-monoids,  and is itself obtained by restriction  from  a categorical equivalence  between partial infinitary clone algebras (which generalise clone algebras) and extensional cm-monoids.In a companion work, we develop the theory of modules over cm-monoids, offering a unified approach to polymorphisms and invariant relations,in the hope of providing new insights into algebraic structures and CSP complexity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to clarify the construction of derived functors. The usual construction, such as in Cartan-Eilenberg or Grothendieck, is somewhat clarified to show that everything can be done in ZFC, unlike the approach using derived categories.</description>

      <title>On the Mac Lane $Q$-Construction for Exact $\infty$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16259v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend McCarthy's stabilization construction to exact $\infty$-categories. This is achieved by constructing, for any functor from exact $\infty$-categories to a fixed stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{A}$, a coherent chain complex in $\mathcal{A}$ that is an immediate generalization of Mac Lane's cubical $Q$-complex computing the stable homology of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>On duoidal $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A duoidal category is a category equipped with two monoidal structures in which one is (op)lax monoidal with respect to the other. In this paper we introduce duoidal $\infty$-categories which are counterparts of duoidal categories in the setting of $\infty$-categories. There are three kinds of functors between duoidal $\infty$-categories, which are called bilax, double lax, and double oplax monoidal functors. We make three formulations of $\infty$-categories of duoidal $\infty$-categories according to which functors we take. Furthermore, corresponding to the three kinds of functors, we define bimonoids, double monoids, and double comonoids in duoidal $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>A computational method for left-adjointness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate an effective method for showing that functors between categories are left adjoints. The method applies to a large class of categories, namely locally finitely presentable categories, which are ubiquitous in practice and include standard examples like Set, Grp, etc. Our method relies on a known description of these categories as orthogonal sub-classes of presheaf categories. The functors on which our method applies are the ones that can be presented as particular profunctors, called Kan models in this context. The method for left-adjointness then relies on computing that a particular criterion is satisfied. From this method, we also derive another method for showing that a category is cartesian closed. As proofs of concept and effectivity, we give a concrete implementation of the structures and of the left-adjointness criterion in OCaml and apply it on several examples.</description>

      <title>Six-Functor Formalisms I : Constructing functors using category of simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is first in a series of papers where we reprove the statements in constructing the Enhanced Operation Map and the abstract six-functor formalism developed by Liu-Zheng. In this paper, we prove a theorem regarding constructing functors between simplicial sets using the category of simplices. We shall reprove the statement using the language of marked simplicial sets and studying injective model structure on functor categories. The theorem is a crucial tool and will be used repeatedly in reproving the $\infty$-categorical compactification and constructing the so called Enhanced Operation Map in the forthcoming articles.</description>

      <title>M\"obius Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops M\"obius homology, a homology theory for representations of finite posets into abelian categories. Although the connection between poset topology and M\"obius functions is classical, we go further by establishing a direct connection between poset topology and M\"obius inversions. In particular, we show that M\"obius homology categorifies the M\"obius inversion, as its Euler characteristic coincides with the M\"obius inversion applied to the dimension function of the representation. We also present a homological version of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem, relating the M\"obius homologies of two posets connected by a Galois connection.
  Our main application concerns persistent homology over general posets. We prove that, under a suitable definition, the persistence diagram arises as an Euler characteristic over a poset of intervals, and thus M\"obius homology provides a categorification of the persistence diagram. This furnishes a new invariant for persistent homology over arbitrary finite posets. Finally, leveraging our homological variant of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem, we establish several results about the persistence diagram.</description>

      <title>Using Enriched Category Theory to Construct the Nearest Neighbour Classification Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first to construct and motivate a Machine Learning algorithm solely with Enriched Category Theory, supplementing evidence that Category Theory can provide valuable insights into the construction and explainability of Machine Learning algorithms. It is shown that a series of reasonable assumptions about a dataset lead to the construction of the Nearest Neighbours Algorithm. This construction is produced as an extension of the original dataset using profunctors in the category of Lawvere metric spaces, leading to a definition of an Enriched Nearest Neighbours Algorithm, which, consequently, also produces an enriched form of the Voronoi diagram. Further investigation of the generalisations this construction induces demonstrates how the $k$ Nearest Neighbours Algorithm may also be produced. Moreover, how the new construction allows metrics on the classification labels to inform the outputs of the Enriched Nearest Neighbour Algorithm: Enabling soft classification boundaries and dependent classifications. This paper is intended to be accessible without any knowledge of Category Theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Cartesian Guarded Recursion with Daggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guarded recursion is a framework allowing for a formalisation of streams in classical programming languages. The latter take their semantics in cartesian closed categories. However, some programming paradigms do not take their semantics in a cartesian setting; this is the case for concurrency, reversible and quantum programming for example. In this paper, we focus on reversible programming through its categorical model in dagger categories, which are categories that contain an involutive operator on morphisms. After presenting classical guarded recursion, we show how to introduce this framework into dagger categories with sufficient structure for data types, also called dagger rig categories. First, given an arbitrary category, we build another category shown to be suitable for guarded recursion in multiple ways, via enrichment and fixed point theorems. We then study the interaction between this construction and the structure of dagger rig categories, aiming for reversible programming. Finally, we show that our construction is suitable as a model of higher-order reversible programming languages, such as symmetric pattern-matching.</description>

      <title>Effectful Mealy Machines: Bisimulation and Trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce effectful Mealy machines - a general notion of Mealy machine with global effects - and give them semantics in terms of both bisimilarity and traces. Bisimilarity of effectful Mealy machines is characterized syntactically, via free uniform feedback. Traces of effectful Mealy machines are given a novel semantic coinductive universe in terms of effectful streams. We prove that this framework generalizes standard causal processes and captures existing flavours of Mealy machine, bisimilarity, and trace.</description>
