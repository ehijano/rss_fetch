      <title>Microsecond electro-optic switching in the nematic phase of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematic liquid crystals exhibit nanosecond electro-optic response to an applied electric field which modifies the degree of orientational order without realigning the molecular orientation. However, this nanosecond electrically-modified order parameter (NEMOP) effect requires high driving fields, on the order of 100 V/um for a modest birefringence change of 0.01. In this work, we demonstrate that a nematic phase of the recently discovered ferroelectric nematic materials exhibits a robust and fast electro-optic response. Namely, a relatively weak field of 20 V/um changes the birefringence by 0.04 with field-on and-off times around 1 us. This microsecond electrically modified order parameter (MEMOP) effect shows a greatly improved figure of merit when compared to other electro-optical switching modes in liquid crystals, including the conventional Frederiks effect, and has a potential for applications in fast electro-optical devices such as phase modulators, optical shutters, displays, and beam steerers.</description>

      <title>A simple yet effective ALE-FE method for the nonlinear planar dynamics of variable-length flexible rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advances in variable-length structures for use in soft actuation, energy harvesting, energy dissipation and metamaterials, the mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of physical systems with time-varying domains is becoming increasingly important. The planar nonlinear dynamics of one-dimensional elastic structures with variable domain is formulated from a Lagrangian approach by using a non-material reference frame. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) scheme is proposed where the domain is reparametrized based on a priori unknown configuration parameters. Based on this formulation, a Finite Element (FE) method is developed for theoretically predicting the evolution of a rod constrained at its ends by one or two sliding-sleeves, whose position and inclination can be varied in time, and under external loadings. Finally, case studies and instability problems are investigated to assess the reliability of the proposed formulation against others available and to demonstrate its effectiveness. With respect to previously developed methods for this type of structural problems, the present ALE-FE approach shows a strong theoretical and implementation simplicity, maintaining an efficient and fast convergence according to the cases analyzed. An open source code realized for the present ALE-FE model is made available for solving the nonlinear dynamics of planar systems constrained by one or two independent sliding sleeves. The present research paves the way for further extensions to easily implement solvers for the three-dimensional dynamics of flexible one- and two-dimensional structural systems with moving boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic self-assembly of neutral particles on a dielectric substrate: A theoretical study via a multiple-image method and an effective-dipole approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiple-image method is developed to accurately calculate the electrostatic interaction between neutral dielectric particles and a uniformly charged dielectric substrate. The difference in dielectric constants between the particle and the solvent medium leads to a reversal of positive and negative polarizations in the particle. The variance in dielectric constants between the solvent medium and the substrate causes a transition from attractive to repulsive forces between the particle and the substrate. A nonuniform electrostatic field is generated by the polarized charges on the substrate due to mutual induction. These characteristics of electrostatic manipulation determine whether particles are adsorbed onto the substrate or pushed away from it. The self-assembled particles tend to aggregate in a stable hexagonal structure on the substrate. These findings provide new insights into self-assembly processes involving neutral particles on a dielectric substrate.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Basis for Odd Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum-type constitutive relations of odd matter need to be formulated according to the second law of thermodynamics. Based on the primitive thermodynamics of Edelen, a procedure admitting most general relations, is outlined for heat-conducting fluids and solids. For viscous responses of odd matter, the theory accounts for the irreversible and non-dissipative forces, besides the hyperdissipative ones. For quasi-static responses, the theory grasps the elastic and non-conservative forces besides those derivable from the free energy, this being the realm of Cauchy elasticity beyond hyperelasticity. In Cosserat-type odd matter, primitive thermodynamics also accounts for curvature-torsion and couple-stress besides, respectively, deformation and force-stress tensors. In both, classical and micropolar cases, the theory grasps all possible couplings between the thermodynamic velocity and force vectors, along with a full range of anisotropies of hyperdissipative and hyperelastic responses (both linear and nonlinear).</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic modelling of bio-compatible PLGA polymers with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A challenging topic in materials engineering is the development of numerical models that can accurately predict material properties with atomistic accuracy, matching the scale and level of detail achieved by experiments. In this regard, coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a popular method for achieving this goal. Despite the efforts of the scientific community, a reliable CG model with quasi-atomistic accuracy has not yet been proposed for the design and prototyping of materials, especially polymers. In this paper we describe a CG model for polymers, focusing on the bio-compatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), based on a general parametrization strategy with a potentially broader field of applications. In this model, polymers are represented with finite-size ellipsoids, short-range interactions are accounted for with the generalized Gay-Berne potential, while electrostatic and long-range interactions are accounted for with point charges within the ellipsoids. The model was validated against its atomistic counterpart, obtained through a back-mapping process, by comparing physical properties such as glass transition temperature, thermal conductivity, and elastic moduli. We observed quantitative agreement between the atomistic and CG representations, thus opening up the possibility of adopting the proposed model to expand the domain size of typical MD simulations to dimensions comparable to those of experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic evolution of contact area in soft contacts during incipient torsional loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many properties of soft contact interfaces are controlled by the contact area (e.g. friction, contact stiffness and surface charge generation). The contact area increases with the contact age at rest. In contrast, it usually reduces under unidirectional shear loading. Although the physical origin of such a reduction is still debated, it always happens in an anisotropic way because the reduction mainly occurs along the shearing direction. Whether such anisotropy is a necessary condition for shear-induced area reduction remains an open question. Here, we investigate the contact area evolution of elastomer-based sphere-plane contacts under an isotropic shear loading, i.e. torsional loading. We find that, when macroscopic sliding is reached, the contact area has undergone a net area reduction. However, the area evolves non-monotonically as the twisting angle increases, with an initial rise up to a maximum before dropping to the value during macroscopic sliding. The ratio of maximum to initial contact area is found weakly dependent on the normal load, angular velocity and dwell time (time interval between the instants when the normal load and twist motion are first applied) within the investigated ranges. We show that non-monotonic area evolution can also be found under unidirectional shear loading conditions under large normal force. These observations challenge the current descriptions of shear-induced contact area evolution and are expected to serve as a benchmark for future modelling attempts in the field.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Multiplectoneme Phases in DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stretched DNA molecule which is also under- or overwound, undergoes a buckling transition forming intertwined looped domains called plectonemes. Here we develop a simple theory that extends the two-phase model of stretched supercoiled DNA, allowing for the coexistence of multiple plectonemic domains by including positional and length distribution entropies. Such a multiplectoneme phase is favored in long DNA molecules in which the gain of positional entropy compensates for the cost of nucleating a plectoneme along a stretched DNA segment. Despite its simplicity, the developed theory is shown to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the twistable wormlike chain model. The theory predicts more plectonemes than experimentally observed, which we attribute to the limited resolution of experimental data. Since plectonemes are detected through fluorescence signals, those shorter than the observable threshold are likely missed.</description>

      <title>Fixing non-positive energies in higher-order homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy functionals produced by second-order homogenization of periodic elastic structures commonly feature negative gradient moduli. We show that this undesirable property is caused by the truncation of the energy expansion in powers of the small scale separation parameter. By revisiting Cholesky's LDLT decomposition, we propose an alternative truncation method that restores positivity while preserving the order of accuracy. We illustrate this method on a variety of periodic structures, both continuous and discrete, and derive compact analytical expressions of the homogenized energy that are positive and accurate to second order. The method can also cure the energy functionals produced by second-order dimension reduction, which suffer similar non-positivity issues. It naturally extends beyond second order.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dominated phase ordering in the one dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems, including some examples of active matter, granular assemblies, and biological systems, show fluctuation-dominated phase ordering (FDPO), where macroscopic fluctuations coexist with long-range order. Most of these systems are out of equilibrium. By contrast, a recent work has analytically demonstrated that an equilibrium one-dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model shows FDPO. The analytical results rely on a cluster representation of the model that we term TIDSI-CL and are governed by the ratio, $c$, of the long-range interaction strength to the critical temperature. We show that the allowed range of $c$ is very narrow in the TIDSI model while it is unbounded in TIDSI-CL. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the TIDSI model and show consistency with the analytical results in the allowed range of $c$. The correlation length grows strongly on approaching the critical point, leading to a broad near-critical region. Within this region, $\alpha$, which is the cusp exponent of the power-law decay of the scaled correlation function at criticality, changes to $\alpha^\text{eff}$. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of the model: the correlation function, domain size distribution, and aging behavior are consistent with the equilibrium properties upon replacing the system size, $L$, with the coarsening length, $\mathcal{L}(t)$. The mean largest cluster size shows logarithmic corrections due to finite $L$ and waiting time, $t_w$. The aging autocorrelation function exhibits two different scaling forms, characterized by exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, at short and long times compared to $t_w$, where $\beta=\alpha/2$.</description>

      <title>Transferability of the chemical bond-based machine learning model for dipole moment: the GHz to THz dielectric properties of liquid propylene glycol and polypropylene glycol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a first-principles study of the dielectric properties of liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) using a recently developed chemical bond-based machine learning (ML) model for dipole moments [T. Amano et al. Phys. Rev. B 110, 165159 (2024)]. The ML dipole models successfully predict the dipole moment of various liquid configurations in close agreement with DFT calculations and generate $20 \mathrm{ns}$ quantum-accuracy dipole moment trajectories to calculate the dielectric function, when combined with ML potentials. The calculated dielectric function of PG closely matches experimental results. We identified a libration peak at $600\, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and an intermolecular mode at $100\, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, previously noted experimentally. Furthermore, the models trained on PG2 training data can apply to longer chain PPG not included in the training data. The present research marks the first step toward developing a universal bond-based dipole model.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Laplace Universality in Correlated Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In transport processes across materials like glasses, living cells, and porous media, the probability density function of displacements exhibits exponential decay rather than Gaussian behavior. We show that this universal behavior of rare events, termed Laplace tails, emerges even when correlations and memory affect the dynamics. Using a renormalization-based approach, we demonstrate that correlations and memory do not suppress these tails but rather enhance their visibility, even at short timescales. The developed analytical framework refines the concept of correlations for rare events and enables the computation of effective parameters that govern Laplace tails in correlated processes. These findings suggest that correlations can serve as a tunable parameter to control the behavior of rare events in transport.</description>

      <title>Heat production in a stochastic system with nonlinear time-delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics we study heat production related to the stochastic motion of a particle driven by repulsive, nonlinear, time-delayed feedback. Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback can lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical Review E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by analytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around the threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production rate, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the nonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime, we compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system and a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the threshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as function of the delay time. In this regime, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ can be approximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the long-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated heat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Long-Ranged Influence of an Inclusion in Momentum-Conserving Active Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an inclusion placed inside a dilute Stokesian suspension of microswimmers induces power-law number-density modulations and flows. These take a different form depending on whether the inclusion is held fixed by an external force, for example an optical tweezer, or if it is free. When the inclusion is held in place, the far-field fluid flow is a Stokeslet, while the microswimmer density decays as $1/r^{2+\epsilon}$, with $r$ the distance from the inclusion, and $\epsilon$ an anomalous exponent which depends on the symmetry of the inclusion and varies continuously as a function of a dimensionless number characterizing the relative amplitudes of the convective and diffusive effects. The angular dependence takes a non-trivial form which depends on the same dimensionless number. When the inclusion is free to move, the far-field fluid flow is a stresslet and the microswimmer density decays as $1/r^2$ with a simple angular dependence. These long-range modulations mediate long-range interactions between inclusions that we characterize.</description>
