      <title>Caught in the act: detections of recoiling supermassive black holes from simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the detectability of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses of $M_{\bullet}\gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ displaced by gravitational wave recoil kicks $(v_{\rm kick}=0\mathrm{-}2000\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1})$ in simulations of merging massive $(M_{\star}&gt;10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot)$ early-type galaxies. The used KETJU code combines the GADGET-4 fast multiple gravity solver with accurate regularised integration and post-Newtonian corrections (up to PN3.5) around SMBHs. The ejected SMBHs carry clusters of bound stellar material (black hole recoil clusters, BRCs) with masses in the range of $10^6 \lesssim M_{\text{BRC}} \lesssim 10^7\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and sizes of several $10\,\mathrm{pc}$. For recoil velocities up to $60\%$ of the galaxy escape velocity, the BRCs are detectable in mock photometric images at a Euclid-like resolution up to redshift $z \sim 1.0$. By Monte Carlo sampling the observability for different recoil directions and magnitudes, we predict that in $\sim20\%$ of instances the BRCs are photometrically detectable, most likely for kicks with SMBH apocentres less than the galaxy effective radius. BRCs occupy distinct regions in the stellar mass/velocity dispersion vs. size relations of known star clusters and galaxies. An enhanced velocity dispersion in excess of $\sigma \sim 600\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ coinciding with the SMBH position provides the best evidence for an SMBH-hosting stellar system, effectively distinguishing BRCs from other faint stellar systems. BRCs are promising candidates to observe the aftermath of the yet-undetected mergers of the most massive SMBHs and we estimate that up to 8000 BRCs might be observable below $z\lesssim 0.6$ with large-scale photometric surveys such as Euclid and upcoming high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy with the Extremely Large Telescope.</description>

      <title>The ionization structure and chemical history in isolated H II regions of dwarf galaxies with IFU I. The Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying metal-poor galaxies is crucial for understanding the physical mechanisms driving the evolution of galaxies. Most observational works in dwarf galaxies employ integral field unit data to investigate gas physics in the entire galaxy body. However, previous studies have not explored the detailed spatially resolved properties of individual extragalactic HII regions. We study the only known HII region in the SagDIG dIrr, a metal-poor dwarf galaxy of the local universe, using VIMOS-IFU/VLT and EFOSC2/NTT archival data. We aim to probe the structure of the gaseous nebulae to (i) give insights into the physical processes shaping its gas dynamics, and (ii) relate these mechanisms to the low gas-phase metallicity content estimated with the direct method. The H$\beta$ emission line map shows two clumps as a biconic-like structure aligned across the same axis. The [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map, on the other hand, shows a more symmetric structure. Radial flux density profiles exhibit signatures of ionized stratification. By comparing the gas structure with the stellar population in the same region, the young stellar population ($&lt;700$ Myr) are found closer to the edges of the biconic-like structure. We estimate 12+log(O/H) = $7.23\pm0.04$ dex with the direct method, considering the whole nebula. Temperature fluctuations are detected, as variations of $T_{e}$ from $\sim 23400$K to $\sim 22000$K, and oxygen abundances from 7.24$\pm0.05$ to 7.50$\pm0.14$ dex, from the centre to the outskirts, respectively. In addition, SagDIG is in line with the low-mass end of the MZR. The observed stratification, the distribution of young MS stars, and the metal-poor content of the HII region suggest that the evolution of SagDIG seems to be actively shaped by stellar feedback processes, likely as the result of extragalactic HII regions being subject to the same gas physics as HII regions of the Milky-Way.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-scale lens search in the PEARLS NEP TDF and CEERS JWST fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present four galaxy scale lenses discovered in two JWST blank-fields: the ~ 54 arcmin^2 of the PEARLS North-Ecliptic-Pole Time-Domain Field (NEP TDF) and in the ~ 90 arcmin^2 of CEERS. We perform the search by visual inspection of NIRCam photometric data, obtaining an initial list of 16 lens candidates. We down-select this list to 4 high-confidence lens candidates, based on lens modelling of the image configuration and photometric redshift measurements for both the source and the deflector. We compare our results to samples of lenses obtained in ground-based and space-based lens searches and theoretical expectations. We expect that JWST observations of field galaxies will yield approximately 1 galaxy scale lens every three to five NIRCam pointings of comparable depth to these observations (~ 9 arcmin^2 each). This shows that JWST, compared to other lens searches, can yield an extremely high number of secure lenses per unit area, with redshift and size distributions complementary to lens samples obtained from ground-based and wide-area surveys. We estimate that a single JWST pure-parallel survey of comparable depth could yield $\sim 70$ galaxy scale lenses, with a third of them having z_lens&gt;1 and z_source&gt;3.</description>

      <title>Quasar Negative Feedback to Surrounding Galaxies Probed with Ly$\alpha$ Emitters and Continuum-Selected Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the statistical analysis of quasar photoevaporation at $z\sim2.2$ by comparing the density of surrounding Ly$\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs) and continuum-selected galaxies, based on the imaging data of Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) and CFHT Large Area $U$-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS). We select 18 quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the HSC Deep/UltraDeep fields, normalize the LAE/continuum-selected galaxy distribution around each quasar with the quasar proximity size, stack them, and then measure the average densities of the galaxies. As a result, we find that the density of LAEs is $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ lower than that of continuum-selected galaxies within the quasar proximity region. Within the quasar proximity region, we find that the LAEs with high Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EWs) are less dense than those with low EWs at the 3$\sigma$ level and that LAEs with EW of $\gtrsim150$ \AA (rest-frame) are predominantly scarce. Finally, we find that both LAEs and continuum-selected galaxies have smaller densities when they are closer to quasars. We argue that the photoevaporation effect is more effective for smaller dark matter haloes predominantly hosting LAEs, but that it may also affect larger haloes.</description>

      <title>An ALMA Study of Molecular Complexity in the Hot Core G336.99-00.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mass star formation involves complex processes, with the hot core phase playing a crucial role in chemical enrichment and the formation of complex organic molecules. However, molecular inventories in hot cores remain limited. Using data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions survey (ATOMS), the molecular composition and evolutionary stages of two distinct millimeter continuum sources in the high-mass star forming region G336.99-00.03 have been characterized. MM1, with 19 distinct molecular species detected, along with 8 isotopologues and several vibrationally/torsionally excited states, has been identified as a hot core. MM2 with only 5 species identified, was defined as a HII region. Isotopic ratios in MM1 were derived, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ranging from 16.0 to 29.2, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O at 47.7, and $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S at 19.2. Molecular abundances in MM1 show strong agreement with other sources and three-phase warm-up chemical models within an order of magnitude for most species. Formation pathways of key molecules were explored, revealing chemical links and reaction networks. This study provides a detailed molecular inventory of two millimeter continuum sources, shedding light on the chemical diversity and evolutionary processes in high-mass star-forming regions. The derived molecular parameters and isotopic ratios offer benchmarks for astrochemical models, paving the way for further investigation into the formation and evolution of complex organic molecules during the hot core phase.</description>

      <title>Deblending Overlapping Galaxies in DECaLS Using Transformer-Based Algorithm: A Method Combining Multiple Bands and Data Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large-scale galaxy surveys, particularly deep ground-based photometric studies, galaxy blending is inevitable and poses a potential primary systematic uncertainty for upcoming surveys. Current deblenders predominantly rely on analytical modeling of galaxy profiles, facing limitations due to inflexible and imprecise models. We present a novel approach using a U-net structured transformer-based network for deblending astronomical images, which we term the CAT-deblender. It was trained using both RGB and grz-band images, spanning two distinct data formats from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) database, including galaxies with diverse morphologies. Our method requires only the approximate central coordinates of each target galaxy, bypassing assumptions on neighboring source counts. Post-deblending, our RGB images retain a high signal-to-noise peak, showing superior structural similarity to ground truth. For multi-band images, the ellipticity of central galaxies and median reconstruction error for the r-band consistently lie within +/-0.025 to +/-0.25, revealing minimal pixel residuals. In our comparison focused on flux recovery, our model shows a mere 1 percent error in magnitude recovery for quadruply blended galaxies, significantly outperforming SExtractor's higher error rate of 4.8 percent. By cross-matching with publicly accessible overlapping galaxy catalogs from the DECaLS database, we successfully deblended 433 overlapping galaxies. Furthermore, we demonstrated effective deblending of 63,733 blended galaxy images randomly selected from the DECaLS database.</description>

      <title>Estimating infall times of galaxies around clusters: how accurately can it be done with observational data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The environment plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution, particularly for galaxies infalling into clusters. Accurately estimating the infall times of galaxies from observations can significantly enhance our understanding of the environmental effects on galaxy evolution. Aims. This paper aims to evaluate existing methods for estimating infall times via the $R-V$ diagram, explore possible strategies to improve accuracy in estimating infall times, and discuss fundamental limitations. Methods. We utilize a TNG300-1 simulation and construct the $R-V$ diagram that is directly comparable to the observations. Using the same dataset, we systematically compare four commonly used methods, including the projected radii, caustic profiles, and two discrete methods. A simple linear partition is also considered as a reference. Results. Each method exhibits distinct characteristics. While the linear partition slightly outperforms other methods, all methods suffer from limited accuracy ($\gtrsim 2.6$ Gyr), constrained by the intrinsic dispersion ($2.53$ Gyr) of infall times in the $R-V$ diagram. Given this limit, we explore two potential approaches that can improve accuracy: (1) the infall time dispersion is smaller in more dynamically relaxed clusters, and (2) employing two estimates of infall times instead of one reduces the dispersion to $\lesssim1.5$ Gyr. We further demonstrate that the intrinsic dispersion primarily arises from orbital overlap: galaxies in different orbital phases overlap with each other in the $R-V$ diagram and thus appear indistinguishable. Conclusions. Orbital overlap fundamentally limits the accuracy of infall time estimation. The linear partition approach could be a simple and robust estimation.</description>

      <title>Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters -- VI. Role of external galactic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMC) and open clusters (OC) are widely considered as potential environments for assembling merging binary stellar-remnant black holes (BBH) via dynamical interactions. However, such moderate mass systems are susceptible to being disrupted by the external tidal field of their host galaxies, potentially limiting their effectiveness as GW sources. In this study, I investigate the formation of BBH mergers in tidally dissolving star clusters. This is achieved with a newly computed grid consisting of 95 evolutionary model star clusters, where the clusters are subjected to a varying extent of tidal stripping. The cluster evolutions are computed with the direct N-body integrator NBODY7 that includes, among others, treatments for post-Newtonian (PN) effects in compact-binary members, mass loss due to stellar evolution, formation of stellar remnants, and tidal stripping. It is found that even strong tidal stripping does not quench the formation of a black hole (BH) core inside a cluster or the formation of dynamical BBH mergers in the system. The overall properties of BBH mergers, e.g., the form of the distribution of merger delay time, primary mass, and mass ratio, and the redshift evolution of merger rate are not significantly altered by the extent of tidal stripping of the parent cluster population. Furthermore, even strongly tidally stripped clusters are capable of dynamically forming Gaia-BH-like detached BH--main-sequence-star binaries that escape into the galactic field. Limitations of the present study and potential future improvements are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Density Profile Around a Newborn First Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient dark matter (DM) around binary black holes can imprint characteristic signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger. The exact signature depends sensitively on the DM density profile around the black holes. We run very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of first star formation that follow the collapse of a $3\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$ mini-halo from $z=49$ to $z\simeq22$. Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of $3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to $0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$pc.We find that a piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%, and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc. The DM density profile is typical for ordinary Pop~III halos, but our additional simulations reveal that inner slope varies significantly with halo-to-halo scatter, and the effect of Lyman-Werner irradiation and of supersonic baryon-DM streaming velocities, implying a wide distribution of slopes rather than a single universal curve. The large variation should be considered when calculating the predicted DM-induced dephasing of gravitational waves by up to an order of magnitude relative to the classical analytic model of the DM spike.</description>

      <title>An improved Seyfert-LINER classification line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, an improved Seyfert-LINER classification line (= S-L line) is proposed in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, based on a sample of 47,968 low redshift narrow emission line galaxies from SDSS DR16, motivated by different S-L lines reported in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram through different methods. The method proposed by Kewley et al. in 2006 is firstly applied, however, the method cannot lead to an accepted S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Meanwhile, the S-L lines proposed by Schawinski et al. in 2007 and Cid Fernandes et al. in 2010 in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram are different from each other. Therefore, it is meaningful to check which proposed S-L line is better or to determine an improved one in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram by a new method. In this manuscript, Seyferts and LINERs that have already been classified in the [S~{\sc ii}] and/or [O~{\sc i}] BPT diagrams can be visualized in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, leading the intersection boundary of the two contour maps to be considered as the S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Rather than the previously proposed S-L lines, the new S-L line can lead to more efficient and harmonious classifications of Seyferts and LINERs, especially in the composite galaxy region, in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Furthermore, based on the discussed S-L lines, the number ratio of Type-2 Seyferts to Type-2 LINERs differs significantly from that of Type-1 Seyferts to Type-1 LINERs in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, suggesting that about 90$\%$ of Type-2 LINERs are non-AGN-related objects, true Type-2 AGNs, or objects exhibiting both Seyfert and LINER characteristics.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. II. Unravelling lithium depletion and stellar motion: Intrinsic stellar properties drive depletion, not kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Paper I, we classified a stellar sample from the thin disc with a broad range in metallicity as being churned outward or inward, or blurred/undisturbed. In this paper (Paper II), we delve deeper by analysing our entire metallicity-stratified sample along with their dynamic properties, focusing on the connection between radial migration and Li depletion. We analyse the chemo-dynamics of a set of 1188 thin disc dwarf stars observed by the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey, previously classified into six metallicity-stratified groups via Hierarchical Clustering (HC). We examine several features, such as effective temperatures, masses, and dynamic properties. We also implement a parametric survival analysis using penalised splines (logistic distribution) to quantify how stellar properties and motion (or migration) direction jointly influence Li depletion patterns. We find that stars in our sample that appear to have churned outward are predominantly Li-depleted, regardless of their metallicities. These stars are also the oldest, coldest, and least massive compared to those in the same HC group that have either churned inward or kept their orbital radii. Our survival analysis confirms temperature as the primary driver of Li depletion, followed by metallicity and age, while migration direction shows negligible influence. The increasing proportion of outward-churned stars with higher metallicity (and older ages) indicates their dominant influence on the overall trend observed in the [Fe/H]-A(Li) space for stellar groups with [Fe/H]&gt;0. The survival model reinforces that the observed Li depletion stems primarily from intrinsic stellar properties (cool temperatures, higher metallicity, old ages) rather than migration history. This suggests the metallicity-dependent depletion pattern emerges through stellar evolution rather than Galactic dynamical processes.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally categorized into long and short bursts based on their duration ($T_{90}$). Recently, it has been proposed that GRBs can also be classified into type I (merger) and type II (collapsar) bursts based on the different origin. From a sample of \textit{Swift} long GRBs~(LGRBs) with a redshift completeness of 60\% and $P \geq 2.6 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$, collected through the end of 2023, we identify a pure sample of 146 Type II GRBs. With this sample, we construct the luminosity function (LF) using both the Broken Power Law (BPL) and Triple Power Law (TPL) models. Our results indicate that, similar to LGRBs, a strong redshift evolution in either luminosity or density is necessary to accurately account for the observations, regardless of the specific form of the LF assumed. The LF of LGRBs remains a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting it follows a BPL form, while others advocate for a TPL form. In our study, we find that the LF of Type II GRBs tends to favor a BPL model.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter bispectrum as a probe of reionization morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift $z=13$, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-$\chi^2$ analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.</description>

Abstract: The Milky Way Backup Program (MWBP), a survey currently underway with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) on the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-m Telescope, works at the margins of the DESI Main surveys to obtain spectra of millions of additional stars from the Gaia catalog. Efficiently utilizing twilight times (&lt;18 deg) and poor weather conditions, the MWBP extends the range of stellar sources studied to both brighter magnitudes and lower Galactic latitude and declination than the stars studied in DESI's Main Milky Way Survey. While the MWBP prioritizes candidate giant stars selected from the Gaia catalog (using color and parallax criteria), it also includes an unbiased sample of bright stars (i.e., 11.2 &lt; G &lt; 16 mag) as well as fainter sources (to G &lt; 19 mag). As of March 1, 2025, the survey had obtained spectra of ~7 million stars, approximately 1.2 million of which are included in the DESI Data Release 1. The full survey, when completed, will cover an area of more than 21,000 square degrees and include approximately 10 million Gaia sources, roughly equal to the number of stellar spectra obtained through the DESI Main Survey, while only utilizing &lt;9% of all DESI observing time.</description>

      <title>Oort Cloud Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's birth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution process is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations from passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t$_{ \rm esc}$) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t$_{ \rm max}$) affect the Oort cloud's ability to survive via $N$-body simulations. In a 14 M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M$_\odot$ with a range of t$_{ \rm esc}$ to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t$_{ \rm max}$. For each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250 Myr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in the cluster from t$_{ \rm max}$ to t$_{ \rm esc}$. Only a fraction of comets tend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t$_{ \rm max}$ and t$_{ \rm esc}$. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t$_{ \rm max}$ of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain &gt;50% of their comets at t$_{ \rm esc}$, respectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the relationship, $\rm f=m\log_{10}(\frac{t_{ \rm esc}-t_{ \rm max}}{Myr})$ where m = 0.32$\pm$0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the cluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing logarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t$_{ \rm max}$.</description>

      <title>Confirmation and characterization of Galactic planetary nebulae: insights from a spectroscopic study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic investigation of 25 objects previously reported as possible Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in recent catalogs to obtain their physical properties and to establish their true nature. We found 11 objects showing intense emission lines, 11 where it was not possible to measure $\mathrm{H{\beta}}$, and three where no lines are present. We have used diagnostic diagrams to confirm the true PN nature for eight objects. We obtained elemental abundances for three objects whose values are in agreement with the PNe mean values for our Galaxy. Four objects show [N II] $\lambda$6583 more intense than $\mathrm{H{\alpha}}$, and for two of them, this can be explained by the presence of shocks in the gas. Finally, we report angular sizes based on $\mathrm{H{\alpha}}$ and [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission.</description>

      <title>Fast inflowing ionized absorber tracing the gas dynamics at sub-parsec scale around Mrk 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion onto supermassive black hole (SMBH) releases energy via radiation, jets or winds, providing feedback effects on the circumnuclear gas environment. However, the dynamics of accreting gas on sub-parsec scales near the SMBH remains poorly understood. With high-resolution X-ray spectra of Mrk 3, we detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing absorber is located at $\lesssim0.04-0.74\rm~pc$ and is decelerating from $6.1\pm0.5\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\pm0.3\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over 11 years. Only $\sim0.6$\%--$3$\% of the inflowing material is estimated to reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk. Furthermore, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity ($Z\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\sim330\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected in the soft X-ray band. It may corresponds to the [O III] biconical outflow in the narrow-line region. A putative ultra-fast disk wind outside our line-of-sight, or clouds within the broad-line region, are promising candidates for decelerating the inflowing absorber.</description>

      <title>Explosion sites of SN 1994W-like transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sample of narrow-line transients that share characteristics with the Type IIn classified supernova (SN) 1994W, a prototypical member of this class of events, via investigation of their explosion sites and spectrophotometric data. The normalised cumulative rank (NCR) method was used to compare the explosion sites of 10 events to the star-formation distributions of their host galaxies, and to the sites of different evolved massive stars. The resulting sample mean value of NCR$_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} = 0.170 \pm 0.076$ is low, while the NCR$_{\mathrm{NUV}}$ distribution is flat with a mean value of $0.488 \pm 0.084$. The NCR distribution of SN 1994W-like events is consistent with relatively low-mass red supergiants (RSGs) and, despite the small sample size, inconsistent with high-mass stars such as luminous blue variables. To explain the nature of SN 1994W-like transients, interaction between an expanding ejecta and a relatively massive circumstellar medium is likely required, with the latter possibly having been produced by a H envelope ejection via a nuclear flash event, or a luminous red nova (LRN) from a stellar merger; both channels are consistent with low-mass RSGs suggested by the NCR results. In this context, we find the early $-26$ d spectrum from light curve maximum of SN 2003G to share similarities to those of F8-type supergiant stars and LRNe. Finally, based on late-time HST imaging, we set the deepest limits for the surviving precursor of SN 2011ht to $M_{\mathrm{F438W}} &gt; -3.8$ and $M_{\mathrm{F555W}} &gt; -4.0$ mag. This would exclude most supergiants as a non-terminal progenitor, assuming that such a star is not completely obscured by newly formed dust.</description>

      <title>Measuring Resolved Star Formation Histories from High-Precision Color-Magnitude Diagrams with StarFormationHistories.jl</title>

Abstract: Understanding how and when galaxies formed stars over the history of the Universe is fundamental to the study of galaxy evolution. The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies in the local Universe can be measured with high precision using deep imaging with space telescopes. Such \emph{resolved} SFHs are based on modelling the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) with stellar evolution models and rely on age-sensitive features like the main sequence turn-off to measure a galaxy's star formation rate as a function of time. There are many other population-level parameters that factor into these measurements, such as the stellar initial mass function (IMF), binary fraction, and metallicity, to name a few. We present and release StarFormationHistories$.$jl, a modular, open-source Julia package for measuring resolved SFHs with a focus on model flexibility for these types of population parameters. The code can model unresolved photometric binaries and supports arbitrary IMFs. Random uncertainties in the SFH measurements can be quantified with Monte Carlo posterior sampling methods. We illustrate the performance of the package on JWST/NIRCAM data of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy WLM $\left(M_v\approx-14.2 \ \text{mag}\right)$, which exhibits a complex, well-sampled CMD, and HST/ACS data of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxy Horologium I $\left(M_v\approx-3.7 \ \text{mag}\right)$, which has a much simpler but sparser CMD.</description>

      <title>The First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH): II. Pilot Survey data release and first results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) is a large-area radio survey for neutral hydrogen in the redshift range 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.0, using the 21cm HI absorption line as a probe of cold neutral gas. FLASH uses the ASKAP radio telescope and is the first large 21cm absorption survey to be carried out without any optical preselection of targets. We use an automated Bayesian line-finding tool to search through large datasets and assign a statistical significance to potential line detections. Two Pilot Surveys, covering around 3000 deg$^2$ of sky, were carried out in 2019-22 to test and verify the strategy for the full FLASH survey. The processed data from these Pilot Surveys (spectral-line cubes, continuum images, and catalogues) are available online. Here, we describe the FLASH spectral-line and continuum data and discuss the quality of the HI spectra and the completeness of our automated line search. Finally, we present a set of 30 new HI absorption lines that were robustly detected in the Pilot Surveys. These lines span a wide range in HI optical depth, including three lines with a peak optical depth $\tau&gt;1$, and appear to be a mixture of intervening and associated systems. Interestingly, around two-thirds of the lines found in this untargeted sample are detected against sources with a peaked-spectrum radio continuum, which are only a minor (5-20%) fraction of the overall radio-source population. The overall detection rate for HI absorption lines in the Pilot Surveys (0.3 to 0.5 lines per ASKAP field) is a factor of two below the expected value. One possible reason for this is the presence of a range of spectral-line artefacts in the Pilot Survey data that have now been mitigated and are not expected to recur in the full FLASH survey. A future paper will discuss the host galaxies of the HI absorption systems identified here.</description>

      <title>The ionizing photon production efficiency of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 4-10$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the ionizing emission of star-forming galaxies is critical to understanding their contribution to reionization and their impact on the surrounding environment. The number of ionizing photons available to reionize the intergalactic medium (IGM) depends not only on the abundance of galaxies but also on their efficiency in producing ionizing photons ($\xi_{ion}$). We aim to estimate the $\xi_{ion}$ using Balmer lines in a sample of 761 galaxies at $4\leq z \leq 10$ selected from different JWST surveys. We used the available HST and JWST photometry to perform a SED fitting in the sample to determine their physical properties. We used the BAGPIPES code and assumed a delayed exponential model for the star formation history. We used the NIRSpec spectra from prism or grating configurations to estimate Balmer luminosities and then constrained $\xi_{ion}$ values after dust correction. We find a mean value of 10$^{25.22}$Hz erg$^{-1}$ for $\xi_{ion}$ in the sample with an observed scatter of 0.42dex. We find an increase in the median values of $\xi_{ion}$ which confirms the redshift evolution of $\xi_{ion}$ found in other works. Regarding the relation with physical properties, we find a decrease of $\xi_{ion}$ with increasing stellar mass, indicating that low-mass galaxies are efficient producers of ionizing photons. We also find an increase of $\xi_{ion}$ with increasing specific star formation rate (sSFR) and increasing UV absolute magnitude, which indicates that faint galaxies and with high sSFR are also efficient producers. We also investigated the relation of $\xi_{ion}$ with the EW([OIII]$\lambda$5007) and find that galaxies with the higher EW([OIII]) are the more efficient producers of ionizing photons. Similarly, we find that galaxies with higher O32 ratios and lower gas-phase metallicities (based on the R23 calibration) show higher $\xi_{ion}$ values.</description>

      <title>TP-AGB stars and stellar population properties of a post-starburst galaxy at $z \sim 2$ through optical and NIR spectroscopy with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed optical and NIR spectral analysis of J-138717, a post-starburst galaxy at $z = 1.8845$ observed with JWST/NIRSpec, for which we derive a stellar mass of $3.5 \pm 0.2 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of $198 \pm 10$ km s$^{-1}$. We estimate an age of $\sim0.9$ Gyr and a sub-solar metallicity (between $-0.4$ and $-0.2$ dex). We find generally consistent results when fitting the optical and NIR wavelength ranges separately or using different model libraries. The reconstruction of the star formation history indicates that the galaxy assembled most of its mass quickly and then rapidly quenched, $\sim0.4$ Gyr prior to observation. Line diagnostics suggest that the weak emission is probably powered by residual star formation (SFR$\sim0.2$M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) or a low-luminosity AGN, with no strong evidence for outflows in ionized or neutral gas. We perform a detailed study of the NIR spectral indices by comparing observations with predictions of several state-of-the-art stellar population models. This is unprecedented at such a high redshift. In particular, the analysis of several CO and CN features argues against a heavy contribution of Thermally Pulsating (TP-)AGB stars. Observations align better with models that include a minimal contribution from TP-AGB stars, but they are also consistent with a mild contribution from TP-AGB stars, assuming a younger age (consistent with the fits). The analysis of other NIR spectral indices shows that current models struggle to reproduce observations. This highlights the need for improved stellar population models in the NIR, especially at young ages and low metallicities, which is most relevant for studying high redshift galaxies in the JWST era.</description>

      <title>Filamentary Hierarchies and Superbubbles I: Characterizing filament properties across a simulated spiral galaxy</title>

Abstract: High resolution surveys reveal that the interstellar medium in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies consists of interlinked hierarchies of filamentary structure and superbubbles extending from galactic to subpc scales. The characterization of filament properties across this hierarchy is of fundamental importance for the origin of giant molecular clouds and their star clusters. In this paper we characterize the properties of filaments greater than 25 pc in length that are produced in the multi-scale galactic MHD simulations of Zhao et al. 2024. By adapting the FilFinder algorithm of Koch &amp; Rosolowsky, 2015, we extract over 500 filaments ranging up to 10 kpc scales, to derive the probability distribution functions for filament masses and lengths, magnetic field orientations, and the gravitational stability and fragmentation patterns of filaments. We find power-law distributions for filament masses and lengths. The former has a power law index $\alpha_m = 1.85$ that is nearly identical to that of observed GMC mass functions in extragalactic and Galactic surveys, suggesting that GMC properties are inherited from their host filaments. The fragmentation of magnetized filaments on 200 pc scales or less occurs when they exceed an average critical line mass, as predicted by theory. On larger scales however, kpc filaments form out of the cold neutral medium (CNM) and fragmentation follows local variations in the critical line mass along spiral arms or at the boundaries of superbubbles.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution of stars stripped in binaries: The effect of metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars stripped of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through binary interaction are thought to be responsible for both hydrogen-poor supernovae and the hard ionizing radiation observed in low-$Z$ galaxies. A population of these stars was recently observed for the first time, but their prevalence remains unknown. In preparation for such measurements, we estimate the mass distribution of hot, stripped stars using a population synthesis code that interpolates over detailed single and binary stellar evolution tracks. We predict that for a constant star formation rate of $1 \,M_\odot$/yr and regardless of metallicity, a scalable model population contains ~30,000 stripped stars with mass $M_{\rm strip}&gt;1M_\odot$ and ~4,000 stripped stars that are sufficiently massive to explode ($M_{\rm strip}&gt;2.6M_\odot$). Below $M_{\rm strip}=5M_\odot$, the distribution is metallicity-independent and can be described by a power law with the exponent $\alpha \sim -2$. At higher masses and lower metallicity ($Z \lesssim 0.002$), the mass distribution exhibits a drop. This originates from the prediction, frequently seen in evolutionary models, that massive low-metallicity stars do not expand substantially until central helium burning or later and therefore cannot form long-lived stripped stars. With weaker line-driven winds at low metallicity, this suggests that neither binary interaction nor wind mass loss can efficiently strip massive stars at low metallicity. As a result, a "helium-star desert" emerges around $M_{\rm strip} =15\, M_\odot$ at $Z=0.002$, covering an increasingly large mass range with decreasing metallicity. We note that these high-mass stars are those that potentially boost a galaxy's He$^+$-ionizing radiation and that participate in the formation of merging black holes. This "helium-star desert" therefore merits further study.</description>

      <title>ChronoFlow: A Data-Driven Model for Gyrochronology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other methods are imprecise. However, the observed dispersion in rotation rates for similar coeval stars has historically been difficult to characterize. To properly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of $\approx$8,000 stars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\approx$15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration ages. These contribute an additional 0.06 dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08 dex. We apply ChronoFlow to estimate ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 6709, and the Theia 456 stellar stream. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars. Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models. ChronoFlow is publicly available at https://github.com/philvanlane/chronoflow.</description>

      <title>Modeling Asteroseismic Yields for the Roman Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) of the Roman Space Telescope will take high cadence data of the Galactic bulge. We investigate the asteroseismic potential of this survey for red giants. We simulate the detectability of global asteroseismic frequencies, $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$, by modify ing Kepler data to match nominal GBTDS observing strategies, considering different noise models, observing cadences, and detection algorithms. Our baseline case, using conservative assumptions, consistently leads to asteroseismic $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ detection probabilities above 80% for red clump and red giant branch stars brighter than 16th magnitude in Roman's F146 filter. We then inject these detection probabilities into a Galaxia model of the bulge to estimate asteroseismic yields. For our nominal case, we detect 290,000 stars in total, with 185,000 detections in the bulge. Different assumptions give bulge yields from 135,000 to 349,000 stars. For stars with measured $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that we can recover $\Delta\nu$ in 21% to 42% of red clump stars, and 69% to 92% of RGB stars. Implications for survey strategy and asteroseismic population studies are discussed more.</description>
