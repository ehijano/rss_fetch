      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Multi-Bit Pulse Encoding in In2O3/Al2O3 Thin-film Transistors for Temporal Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware, physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally, we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost. Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the 4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical reservoir implementations across different material platforms.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity Breaking and High-Dimensional Chaos in Random Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural model introduced by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, and Sommers (SCS) nearly four decades ago has become a paradigmatic framework for studying complex dynamics in random recurrent networks. In its original formulation, with balanced positive and negative couplings, the model exhibits two phases: a quiescent regime, where all activity ceases, and a regime of ongoing irregular collective activity, termed asynchronous chaos (AC), in which state variables fluctuate strongly in time and across units but average to zero across the network. Building on recent work, we analyze an extension of the SCS model that breaks this coupling balance, yielding a richer phase diagram. In addition to the classical quiescent and AC phases, two additional regimes emerge, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the persistent-activity (PA) phase, each unit settles into a distinct, stable activation state. In the synchronous-chaotic (SC) phase, dynamics remain irregular and chaotic but fluctuate around a nonzero mean, generating sustained long-time autocorrelations. Using analytical techniques based on dynamical mean-field theory, complemented by extensive numerical simulations, we show how structural disorder gives rise to symmetry and ergodicity breaking. Remarkably, the resulting phase diagram closely parallels that of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model, with the onset of the SC phase coinciding with the transition associated with replica-symmetry breaking. All key features of spin glasses, including ergodicity breaking, have clear counterparts in this recurrent network context, albeit with crucial idiosyncratic differences, highlighting a unified perspective on complexity in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian many-body localization in asymmetric chains with long-range interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between many-body localization and spectra in non-Hermitian many-body systems is crucial. In a one-dimensional clean, long-range interaction-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization system, we have discovered the coexistence of static and dynamic spectral real-complex phase transitions, along with many-body ergodic-localized phase transitions. The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>The Phase Diagram for Percolating Free Surfaces in Disordered Assemblies of Faceted Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Percolation in systems made up of randomly placed impermeable grains is often examined in the context of system spanning clusters of connected solids forming above a relatively low critical grain density $\rho_{c1}$ or networks of interstitial void volumes ceasing to exist above a signficantly higher threshold $\rho_{c2}$. In this work, we interpret these percolation transitions as, respectively, the low and high density boundaries of percolating exposed surfaces which either ensheath clusters of impermeable particles or line tunnel-like voids. Moreover, we find in the thermodynamic limit exposed surfaces are either sheaths or tunnels with a second order phase transition from the former to the latter at a density threshold $\rho_{c*}$ intermediate between $\rho_{c1}$ and $\rho_{c2}$. We calculate critical inclusion densities with a new method which identifies exposed free surfaces in a geometrically exact manner with a computational cost scaling only linearly in the system volume. We obtain $\rho_{c1}$, $\rho_{c2}$, and $\rho_{c*}$ for a variety of grain geometries, including each of the Platonic solids, truncated icosahedra, and structurally disordered inclusions formed from cubes subject to a random sequence of slicing planes. In the case of the latter, we find a limiting value of $5\%$ for the critical porosity at the void percolation threshold as the number of sustained slices per cube becomes large.</description>

      <title>Attention to Order: Transformers Discover Phase Transitions via Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions mark qualitative reorganizations of collective behavior, yet identifying their boundaries remains challenging whenever analytic solutions are absent and conventional simulations fail. Here we introduce learnability as a universal criterion, defined as the ability of a transformer model containing attention mechanism to extract structure from microscopic states. Using self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo generated configurations of the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that ordered phases correspond to enhanced learnability, manifested in both reduced training loss and structured attention patterns, while disordered phases remain resistant to learning. Two unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Growth from Entangled States: A Unified Perspective on Entanglement Generation and Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits. Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move'' dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are ``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: Approximating the Quantum Geometric Tensor with Block Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.</description>

      <title>Average-case quantum complexity from glassiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate multi-component metallic glass systems using a hybrid Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Variance-Constrained Semi-Grand Canonical approach. This method enables us to generate samples with properties consistent with experimental observations, at deeply supercooled states that are typically inaccessible with conventional MD simulations. Using a realistic interatomic potential, we investigate the dynamics, kinetic stability, and rheology of a ZrCuAl metallic glass, together with the widely studied ZrCu system, in the low-temperature glassy regime, specifically, for ZrCu below its experimental glass-transition temperature. Our results demonstrate how the hybrid method enhances relaxation and provides a generic framework for modeling realistic complex metallic glasses in close agreement with experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the relation between p-adic numbers and kernels in view of a recent large deviation theory for mean-field spin glasses. As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function by constructing a kernel representation of the Primon gas based on a finite p-base, thereby establishing a concrete link between number theory and kernel theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in rotationally invariant spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Interpolants: A Unifying Framework for Flows and Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08797v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of generative models that unifies flow-based and diffusion-based methods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo and Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time stochastic processes called stochastic interpolants to bridge any two probability density functions exactly in finite time. These interpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with an additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The time-dependent density function of the interpolant is shown to satisfy a transport equation as well as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion coefficient. Upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based on probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations with an adjustable level of noise. The drift coefficients entering these models are time-dependent velocity fields characterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score. We show that minimization of these quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for generative models built upon stochastic dynamics, while likelihood control for deterministic dynamics is more stringent. We also construct estimators for the likelihood and the cross entropy of interpolant-based generative models, and we discuss connections with other methods such as score-based diffusion models, stochastic localization, probabilistic denoising, and rectifying flows. In addition, we demonstrate that stochastic interpolants recover the Schr\"odinger bridge between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the interpolant. Finally, algorithmic aspects are discussed and the approach is illustrated on numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions (2D) proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-like hexatic phase. However, alternative mixed-melting scenarios, in which melting proceeds through the hexatic phase with both continuous and discontinuous transitions, have also been observed in some 2D systems. Here, we imaged silver iodide (AgI) embedded in multilayer graphene using time and temperature resolved in-situ atomic-resolution scanning transmission microscopy (STEM) and nanobeam electron diffraction. We observe the hexatic phase and provide evidence supporting a mixed melting scenario.</description>

      <title>Explicit equivalence between the spectral localizer and local Chern and winding markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral localizer invariant.
  However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here, we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible to a broader physics audience.</description>

Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</description>
