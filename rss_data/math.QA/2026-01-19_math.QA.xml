      <title>A Magnus group construction for a class of Borcherds algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a group associated to a class of Borcherds algebras that admit a direct sum decomposition into a Kac--Moody (or semi-simple) subalgebra and a pair of free Lie subalgebras. Such Borcherds algebras have no mutually orthogonal imaginary simple roots.Our group is a semi-direct product of a Kac--Moody (or semi-simple) group and a Magnus group of invertible formal power series corresponding to a basis of a certain highest weight module determined by the simple imaginary roots. We show that our group is independent of this choice of basis, up to isomorphism. We apply our construction to a number of concrete examples, such as certain Borcherds algebras formed using root lattices of hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebras, the Monster Lie algebra, Monstrous Lie algebras of Fricke type and the gnome Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Representations of Spectrum of GL(m) type Quantum Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we are dealing with reflection equation algebras ${\cal L}(R)$ corresponding to even skew-invertible Hecke symmetries. Our main result consists in computing the characters of the spectral values of the generating matrix $L$ of ${\cal L}(R)$ in finite-dimensional representations labeled by partitions of integers. As is known, the spectral values belong to an algebraic extension of the center of the reflection equation algebra and elements of the center can be presented as symmetric functions in spectral values. As an application of our approach, we calculate the characters of the power sums $\mathrm{Tr}_R(L^n)$ in the mentioned finite dimensional representations.
  In a particular case of the Drinfeld-Jimbo $R$-matrix the enveloping algebra $U(gl(N))$ can be obtained as a specific limit of the reflection equation algebra. In this limit our results for power sums coincide with the those obtained in [PP].</description>

      <title>Classification of 1-super-transitive quantum subgroups in type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a notion of super-transitivity for \`etale algebra objects $A \in \mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$. This definition is a direct analogue of the notion of super-transitivity for subfactors, and measures at what depth the first ``new stuff'' appears in the category of $A$-modules internal to $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$. Our main theorem gives a classification of all 1-super-transitive \`etale algebra objects in $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$ running over all $N,k \in \mathbb{N}$. Our classification captures all known infinite families of non-pointed \`etale algebras in $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_N, k)$, and includes all but 16 of the known non-pointed \`etale algebra objects in these categories. These remaining 16 known examples have super-transitivities between 2 and 4.</description>

      <title>Vertex $F$-Algebras and Their Associated Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertex $F$-algebras are a deformation of the concept of an ordinary vertex algebra in which the additive formal group law is replaced by an arbitrary formal group law $F$. The main theorem of this paper constructs a Lie algebra from a vertex $F$-algebra - for the additive formal group law, this extends Borcherds' well-known construction for ordinary vertex algebras. Our construction involves the new concept of an $F$-residue and some other new algebraic concepts, which are deformations of familiar concepts for the special case of an additive formal group law.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic structures on link complements, octahedral decompositions, and quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic structures on link complements (equivalently, representations of the fundamental group into $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$) can be described algebraically by using the octahedral decomposition determined by a link diagram. The decomposition (like any ideal triangulation) gives a set of gluing equations in shape parameters whose solutions are hyperbolic structures. We show that these equations can be obtained from Kashaev-Reshetikhin's braiding on the Kac-de Concini quantum group $\mathcal{U}_\xi(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at a root of unity $\xi$. This braiding gives coordinates on the $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ representation variety of a link and our work shows how to interpret these geometrically.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantisation of exact shifted symplectic structures, with an application to vanishing cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the author's and CPTVV's correspondence between shifted symplectic and Poisson structures to establish a correspondence between exact shifted symplectic structures and non-degenerate shifted Poisson structures with formal derivation, a concept generalising constructions by De Wilde and Lecomte. Our formulation is sufficiently general to encompass derived algebraic, analytic and $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ stacks, as well as Lagrangians and non-commutative generalisations. We also show that non-degenerate shifted Poisson structures with formal derivation carry unique self-dual deformation quantisations in any setting where the latter can be formulated.
  One application is that for (not necessarily exact) $0$-shifted symplectic structures in analytic and $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ settings, it follows that the author's earlier parametrisations of quantisations are in fact independent of any choice of associator, and generalise Fedosov's parametrisation of quantisations for classical manifolds.
  Our main application is to complex $(-1)$-shifted symplectic structures, showing that our unique quantisation of the canonical exact structure, a sheaf of twisted $BD_0$-algebras with derivation, gives rise to BBDJS's perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles, equipped with its monodromy operator.</description>
