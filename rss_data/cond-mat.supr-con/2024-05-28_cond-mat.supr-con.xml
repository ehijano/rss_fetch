      <title>A numerical method for designing topological superconductors induced by s-wave superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductors, as one of the most important research directions at present, have attracted much attention because of their potential to realize topological quantum computation. However, a universal computational tool based on first-principle calculations for topological superconductivity was not yet fully developed, and eventually significant challenges in predicting topological superconducting materials. It is difficult to calculate the topological superconducting properties of the system in a self-consistent manner. In this paper, we develop a numerical method to characterize the superconducting band spectrum and superconducting topological invariants of two-dimensional (2D) slab system from first-principles calculations and implemented in an open-source software WannierTools. We hope that it would accelerate the discovery of the topological superconductor candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantized bound states around a vortex in anisotropic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bound states around a vortex in anisotropic superconductors is a longstanding yet important issue. In this work, we develop a variational theory on the basis of the Andreev approximation to obtain the energy levels and wave functions of the low-energy quantized bound states in superconductors with anisotropic pairing on arbitrary Fermi surface. In the case of circular Fermi surface, the effective Schr\"odinger equation yielding the bound state energies gets back to the theory proposed by Volovik and Kopnin many years ago. Our generalization here enables us to prove the equidistant energy spectrum inside a vortex in a broader class of superconductors. More importantly, we are now able to obtain the wave functions of these bound states by projecting the quasiclassical wave function on the eigenmodes of the effective Schr\"odinger equation, going beyond the quasiclassical Eilenberger results, which, as we find, are sensitive to the scattering rate. For the case of isotropic Fermi surface, the spatial profile of the low-energy local density of states is dominated near the vortex center and elongates along the gap antinode directions, in addition to the ubiquitous Friedel oscillation arising from the quantum inteference neglected in the Eilenberger theory. Moreover, as a consequence of the pairing anisotropy, the quantized wave functions develop a peculiar distribution of winding number, which reduces stepwise towards the vortex center. Our work provides a flexible way to study the vortex bound states in the future.</description>

      <title>Anomalous isotope Effect in d-wave superconductors on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotope effect with a large coefficient $\alpha=-\partial \ln T_c/\partial \ln M$ is usually taken as an evidence of phonon mediated superconductors in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. However, in cuprates which are now widely believed to be strong correlation induced d-wave superconductors, $\alpha$ is experimentally observed to be quite small at optimal doping, but keeps growing up with decreasing $T_c$ upon doping, even after exceeding the BCS value $1/2$. Such an anomalous isotope effect seems to challenge the non-phonon picture and still leave room for the phonon-dominated mechanism. In this work, we show that the anomalous dependence of $\alpha$ on $T_c$ can actually be obtained in spin fluctuation induced d-wave superconductors, by studying the Hubbard model on square lattices with functional renormalization group. We have considered two types of electron-phonon couplings (EPCs). The first type couples to electron densities, including the Holstein, breathing and buckling phonons, called Holstein-like. For all these EPCs, $\alpha$ is negative and drops down towards $-\infty$ with decreasing $T_c$ upon doping. On the opposite, for the other type of Peierls-like EPC coupling to electron hoppings on the nearest bonds, also called Su-Schrieffer-Heeger phonon, $\alpha$ is positive, grows up with decreasing $T_c$ and tends to diverge as $T_c\to0$, in qualitative agreement with the experiments. The difference between these two types of EPCs can be understood by their isotope effects on spin fluctuations. From this study, we conclude that the SSH phonon can explain the anomalous isotope effect in cuprates, although it is not the leading pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Josephson bifurcation readout: beyond the monochromatic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze properties of bifurcation quantum detectors based on weakly nonlinear superconducting resonance circuits, in particular, with application to quantum readout. The developed quantitative description demonstrates strong influence of higher harmonics on their characteristics. While this effect is relevant for various circuits, including the conventional Josephson bifurcation amplifier and the parametrically driven circuit, we first focus on the period-doubling bifurcation under a force driving. This kind of bifurcation is due to nominally quadratic nonlinearity, which enables parametric down-conversion of the driving signal at nearly double resonance frequency to the basic mode. We analyze the effect of higher harmonics on the dynamics of the basic mode, inherent in a nonlinear circuit, which in our case is based on a Josephson junction with a sinusoidal current-phase relation as the origin of nonlinearity. We demonstrate that effects beyond the monochromatic approximation significantly modify the bare characteristics and evaluate their contribution. Due to high sensitivity of this circuit to small variations of parameters, it can serve as an efficient detector of the quantum state of superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer and Spin-Valley locking in 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is a superconductor that exhibits unique characteristics such as time-reversal symmetry breaking, hidden magnetic memory, and topological edge modes. It is a naturally occurring heterostructure comprising of alternating layers of 1H-TaS$_2$ and 1T-TaS$_2$. The former is a well-known superconductor, while the latter is a correlated insulator with a possible non-trivial magnetic ground state. In this study, we use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the normal state electronic structure of this unconventional superconductor. Our findings reveal that the band structure of 4H-TaS$_2$ fundamentally differs from that of its constituent materials. Specifically, we observe a significant charge transfer from the 1T layers to the 1H layers that drives the 1T layers away from half-filling. In addition, we find a substantial reduction in inter-layer coupling in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ compared to the coupling in 2H-TaS$_2$ that results in a pronounced spin-valley locking within 4Hb-TaS$_2$</description>

      <title>Unusual switch from low-temperature T-quadratic resistivity in the underdoped pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors to low-temperature T-linear resistivity in the overdoped strange-metal phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport experiments demonstrate a dramatic switch from the low-temperature T-linear resistivity in the overdoped strange-metal phase to the T-quadratic resistivity in the underdoped pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors, however, a consensus on the origin of this switch is still lacking. Here the low-temperature resistivity in the underdoped pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors is investigated using the Boltzmann transport equation. The low-temperature resistivity originates from the electron umklapp scattering mediated by the spin excitation. However, the dominant contribution to the resistivity mainly comes from the antinodal umklapp scattering. In particular, a low temperature $T_{scale}$ scales with $\Delta^{2}_{p}$ in the underdoped regime due to the opening of a momentum-dependent spin pseudogap, where $\Delta_{p}$ is the minimal umklapp vector at the antinode. Notably, this $T_{scale}$ as a function of doping presents a similar behavior of the antinodal spin pseudogap crossover temperature, i.e., $T_{scale}$ decreases with the increase of doping in the underdoped regime, and then is reduced to a very low temperature in the overdoped regime. In the underdoped regime, the resistivity is T-quadratic in the low temperatures below $T_{scale}$ with the strength of the T-quadratic resistivity that weakens as the doping is raised. However, in the overdoped regime, the resistivity is T-linear in the low temperatures above $T_{scale}$. The result in this paper together with the recent study on the electrical transport in the overdoped regime therefore show that the electron Umklapp scattering from a spin excitation responsible for the low-temperature T-linear resistivity in the overdoped strange-metal phase naturally produces the low-temperature T-quadratic resistivity in the underdoped pseudogap phase resulting from the opening of a momentum dependent spin pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Temperature evolution of the Fermi surface of the FeSe monolayer on STO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in FeSe monolayer on SrTiO$_3$ belongs to one of the unresolved mysteries in condensed-matter physics. Here by investigation of the temperature evolution of the dynamic charge response of FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ we demonstrate that the response of the monolayer itself is nearly temperature independent. This indicates a constant Fermi surface over a wide range of temperature, in stark contrast to that of the bulk FeSe and other Fe-based superconductors. Our results, which manifest the peculiarity of the electronic structure of the FeSe monolayer, may help for a microscopic understanding of the superconductivity in Fe-chalcogenide monolayers on oxide surfaces in general.</description>

      <title>Engineered Josephson diode effect in kinked Rashba nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect, reminiscent of the unidirectional charge transport in semiconductor diodes, is characterized by a nonreciprocal, dissipationless flow of Cooper pairs. This remarkable phenomenon arises from the interplay between symmetry constraints and the inherent quantum behavior of superconductors. Here, we explore the geometric control of the diode effect in a kinked nanostrip Josephson junction based on a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEGs) with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the diode effect as a function of the kink angle and the out-of-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram, showcasing a geometry and field-controlled diode effect. The phase diagram also reveals the presence of an anomalous Josephson effect related to the emergence of trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states, which can evolve into Majorana bound states. Our findings indicate that the exceptional synergy between geometric control of the diode effect and topological phases can be effectively leveraged to design and optimize superconducting devices with tailored transport properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring Superconductivity: The Interplay of Electronic Orders in Topological Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum materials hold great promise for future technological applications. Their unique electronic properties, such as protected surface states and exotic quasiparticles, offer opportunities for designing novel electronic devices, spintronics, and quantum information processing. The origin of the interplay between various electronic orders in topological quantum materials, such as superconductivity and magnetism, remains unclear, particularly whether these electronic orders cooperate, compete, or simply coexist. Since the 2000s, the combination of topology and matter has sparked a tremendous surge of interest among theoreticians and experimentalists alike. Novel theoretical descriptions and predictions, as well as complex experimental setups confirming or refuting these theories, continuously appear in renowned journals. This review aims to provide conceptual tools to understand the fundamental concepts of this ever-growing field. Superconductivity and its historical development will serve as a second pillar alongside topological materials. While the primary focus will be on topological superconductors, other topological materials, such as topological insulators and topological semimetals, will also be explained phenomenologically.</description>

      <title>Extended superconducting fluctuation region and 6e and 4e flux-quantization in a Kagome compound with a normal state of 3Q-order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting state with the usual 2e-flux quantization formed from a normal state with 3Q charge density or loop-current order is a linear combination of 3 different paired states with an overall gauge invariant phase and two internal phases such that the phases in equilibrium are at $2\pi/3$ with respect to each other. In the fluctuation regime of such a 3-component superconductor, internal phase fluctuations are of the same class as for frustrated classical xy-spins on a triangular lattice. The fluctuation region is known therefore to be abnormally extended below the mean-field or the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature. A 6e-flux and a 4e-flux quantized states can be constructed which are also eigenstates of the BCS Hamiltonian and stationary points of the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy with a transition temperature above that of the renormalized 2e-flux quantized state. Such states have no internal phases and so no frustrating internal phase fluctuations. These state however cannot acquire long-range order because their free-energy is higher than the co-existing fluctuating state of 2e flux-quantization. 6e- as well as 4e- flux-quantized Little-Parks oscillations however occur in which the resistivity increases periodically with field above that of the 2e-fluctuating state in its extended fluctuation regime, as are observed, followed at low temperatures to a condensation of the time-reversal odd 2e-quantized state</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02893v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory of strong coupling superconductivity in uranium compounds has been developed, based on electron-electron interaction through magnetic fluctuations described by frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic field dependence of the electron effective mass is expressed through the field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility components. It is shown that the intensity of triplet pairing, and hence the critical temperature of the transition to the superconducting state, is also determined by the field-dependent susceptibility. The results are discussed in relation to the properties of ferromagnetic uranium compounds URhGe and UCoGe, as well as the recently discovered UTe2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proximity effect at superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) interfaces, which manifests itself as generation of Neel-type triplet correlations, leads to sensitivity of the superconducting critical temperature to the mutual orientation of the AF Neel vectors in AF/S/AF trilayers, which is called the spin-valve effect. Here we predict that the spin-valve effect in AF/S/AF heterostructures crucially depends on the value of the chemical potential of the superconducting interlayer due to the occurrence of the finite-momentum Neel triplet correlations. In addition we investigate equal-spin triplet correlations, which appear in AF/S/AF structures for non-aligned Neel vectors of the AFs, and their role in the nonmonotonic dependence of the superconducting critical temperature of the AF/S/AF structure on the mutual orientation of the AF Neel vectors. The influence of impurities on the spin-valve effect is also investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-terminal device consisting of an $s$-wave superconductor coupled to an altermagnet, to generate highly correlated spin currents via Cooper pair splitting. Remarkably, we find that the correlated spin currents are induced by specular Andreev reflections in the altermagnet, an effect that has up to now been predicted to occur only in a very limited number of systems, e.g., Dirac/Weyl materials coupled to superconductors. We demonstrate that positive non-local charge currents and positive noise cross-correlations are unambiguous fingerprints of the specular Andreev reflections in our proposed device.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetries and Interactions: An isolated fixed point Vs a manifold of strongly interacting fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study conditions of continuous emergent symmetries in gapless states, either as topological quantum critical points (TQCPs) or a stable phase with protecting symmetries and connections to smooth deformations of the gapped states around. We illustrate that for a wide class of gapless states that can be associated with fully-isolated scale invariant fixed points, there shall always be emergent continuous symmetries that are directly related to smooth deformations of gapped states with symmetries lower than the protecting ones $G_p$. For a 3D TQCP in DIII classes with $G_p=Z^T_2$, $U_{EM}=U(1)$ and $N_f=\frac{1}{2}$ fermions but without charge $U(1)$ symmetry, we explicitly construct a corresponding boundary representation based on a $4D$ topological state with lattice symmetry $H=Z^T_2 \ltimes U(1)$ and $N_f={1}$ fermions. Although emergent continuous symmetries appear to be robust at weakly interacting TQCPs, we further show the breakdown of such one-to-one correspondence between deformations of gapped states and emergent continuous symmetries when gapless states become strongly interacting. In a strongly interacting limit, gapless states can be represented by a smooth manifold of conformal-field-theory fixed points rather than a fully isolated one. A smooth manifold of strong coupling fixed points hinders emergence of a continuous emergent symmetry in the strongly interacting gapless limit, as deformations no longer leave a gapless state or a TQCP invariant, unlike in the more conventional weakly interacting case. This typically reduces continuous emergent symmetries to a discrete symmetry originating from duality transformations under the protection symmetry $G_p$.</description>

Abstract: Continuous quantum phase transitions are widely assumed and frequently observed in various systems of quantum particles or spins. Their characteristic trait involves scaling laws governing a second-order, gradual suppression of the order parameter as the quantum critical point is approached. The localization of Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors and the resulting breakdown of superconductivity have long stood as a prototypical example. Here, we show a departure from this paradigm, showcasing that amorphous superconducting films of indium oxide undergo a distinctive, discontinuous first-order quantum phase transition tuned by disorder. Through systematic measurements of the plasmon spectrum in superconducting microwave resonators, we provide evidence for a marked jump of both the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness and the transition temperature at the critical disorder. This discontinuous transition sheds light on the previously overlooked role of repulsive interactions between Cooper pairs and the subsequent competition between superconductivity and insulating Cooper-pair glass. Furthermore, our investigation shows that the critical temperature of the films no longer relates to the pairing amplitude but aligns with the superfluid stiffness, consistent with the pseudogap regime of preformed Cooper pairs. Our findings raise fundamental new questions into the role of disorder in quantum phase transitions and carry implications for superinductances in quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Superconducting magnetoelectric effects in mesoscopic hybrid structures</title>

Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom, multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Symmetry Breaking: Unequal Probabilities of Vacuum Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05168</link>

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental notion in modern physics, ranging from high energy to condensed matter. However, the usual spontaneous symmetry breaking only considers the equal probability to select the vacua. In this work, we conceive a model to realize the unequal probability of the symmetry breaking, leading to an unbalanced number of ground states. Specifically, we study the probabilities of a scalar field to roll down from the top of a potential, where the top is only $C^1$ continuous. As the whole system is subject to random perturbations, we find that the probability for the field to roll down to the left or right side depends the square root of the second derivative of the potential at the top. We solve this problem theoretically by using the Fokker-Planck equations in stochastic process and verify our findings numerically. This study may potentially be a new mechanism to explain the origins of asymmetries in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the higher temperature pseudogap 'Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.</description>
