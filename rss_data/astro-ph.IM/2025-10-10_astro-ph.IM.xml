      <title>An Introduction to Mars Terraforming, 2025 Workshop Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terraforming Mars is an age old science fiction concept now worth revisiting through the lens of modern science and technology. This document serves as a summary of contemporary ideas about Mars terraforming, prepared for attendees of the 2025 Green Mars Workshop. It presents one illustrative story of how Mars might be transformed into a habitable world. The story is told in reverse, beginning with possible planetary endpoints and tracing backward to the steps required to reach them. Along the way, it highlights alternative approaches, critical unknowns and research priorities, and the near term applications and benefits of terraforming research for planetary science, climate engineering, and sustainable technologies on Earth.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origin of Water in Planets within Habitable Zones by HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do habitable environments arise and evolve within the context of their planetary systems? This is one fundamental question, and it can be addressed partly by identifying how planets in habitable zones obtain water. Historically, astronomers considered that water was delivered to the Earth via dynamical shake-up by Jupiter, which took place during the formation and post-formation eras (e.g., $\lesssim 100$ Myr). This hypothesis has recently been challenged by a more dynamic view of planet formation; planet-forming materials move in protoplanetary disks via various physical processes such as pebble drift and planetary migration. \textit{Habitable Worlds Observatory} (HWO) will open a new window to address this important, but difficult question by discovering and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets around G-type stars. In this article, we consider two possible working hypotheses: (1) the abundance of water on planets in habitable zones has \textit{any} correlation with the presence of outer planets; and (2) the abundance of water on planets in habitable zones has \textit{no} correlation with the presence of outer planets. We discuss what physical parameters need to be measured to differentiate these two hypotheses and what observational capabilities are desired for HWO to reliably constrain these physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshift Estimation for Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 with Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic analysis of photometric redshifts (photo-z) estimated from the Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) data taken with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Commissioning Camera. Employing the Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL) framework, we apply eight photo-z algorithms to the DP1 photometry, using deep ugrizy coverage in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) field and griz data in the Rubin_SV_38_7 field. In the ECDFS field, we construct a reference catalog from spectroscopic redshift (spec-z), grism redshift (grism-z), and multiband photo-z for training and validating photo-z. Performance metrics of the photo-z are evaluated using spec-zs from ECDFS and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 samples. Across the algorithms, we achieve per-galaxy photo-z scatter of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.03$ and outlier fractions around 10% in the 6-band data, with performance degrading at faint magnitudes and z&gt;1.2. The overall bias and scatter of our machine-learning based photo-zs satisfy the LSST Y1 requirement. We also use our photo-z to infer the ensemble redshift distribution n(z). We study the photo-z improvement by including near-infrared photometry from the Euclid mission, and find that Euclid photometry improves photo-z at z&gt;1.2. Our results validate the RAIL pipeline for Rubin photo-z production and demonstrate promising initial performance.</description>

      <title>Object Classification from JWST Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST's exquisite data have opened the doors to new possibilities in detecting broad classes of astronomical objects, but also to new challenges in classifying those objects. In this work, we introduce SESHAT, the Stellar Evolutionary Stage Heuristic Assessment Tool for the identification of Young Stellar Objects, field stars (main sequence through asymptotic giant branch), brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, and galaxies, from any JWST observation. This identification is done using the machine learning method XGBoost to analyze thousands of rows of synthetic photometry, modified at run-time to match the filters available in the data to be classified. We validate this tool on real data of both star-forming regions and cosmological fields, and find we are able to reproduce the observed classes of objects to a minimum of 80\% recall across every class, without additional information on the ellipticity or spatial distribution of the objects. Furthermore, this tool can be used to test the filter choices for JWST proposals, to verify whether the chosen filters are sufficient to identify the desired class of objects. SESHAT is released as a Python package to the community for general use.</description>

      <title>FlowLensing: Simulating Gravitational Lensing with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise, are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency. FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis, offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.</description>

      <title>Mephisto: Self-Improving Large Language Model-Based Agents for Automated Interpretation of Multi-band Galaxy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical research has long relied on human expertise to interpret complex data and formulate scientific hypotheses. In this study, we introduce Mephisto -- a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self-play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations -- including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered "Little Red Dot" galaxies -- we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices. This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Emergent Denoising of SDSS Galaxy Spectra Through Unsupervised Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopy represents the ideal observational method to maximally extract information from galaxies regarding their star formation and chemical enrichment histories. However, absorption spectra of galaxies prove rather challenging at high redshift or in low mass galaxies, due to the need to spread the photons into a relatively large set of spectral bins. For this reason, the data from many state-of-the-art spectroscopic surveys suffer from low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, and prevent accurate estimates of the stellar population parameters. In this paper, we tackle the issue of denoising an ensemble by the use of unsupervised Deep Learning techniques trained on a homogeneous sample of spectra over a wide range of S/N. These methods reconstruct spectra at a higher S/N and allow us to investigate the potential for Deep Learning to faithfully reproduce spectra from incomplete data. Our methodology is tested on three key line strengths and is compared with synthetic data to assess retrieval biases. The results suggest a standard Autoencoder as a very powerful method that does not introduce systematics in the reconstruction. We also note in this work how careful the analysis needs to be, as other methods can -- on a quick check -- produce spectra that appear noiseless but are in fact strongly biased towards a simple overfitting of the noisy input. Denoising methods with minimal bias will maximise the quality of ongoing and future spectral surveys such as DESI, WEAVE, or WAVES.</description>

      <title>Unified Spectrospatial Forward Models: Spatially Continuous Maps of Weak Emission Lines in the Rosette Nebula with SDSS-V LVM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyses of IFU data are typically performed on a per-spaxel basis, with each spectrum modelled independently. For low signal-to-noise (S/N) features such as weak emission lines, estimating properties is difficult and imprecise. Arbitrary binning schemes boost S/N at the cost of resolution, and risk introducing biases. We present a general forward-modelling approach that assumes spectra close on the sky are more similar than distant ones, and so can be modelled jointly. These "spectrospatial" models exploit spatial correlation to provide robust inferences, while simultaneously providing continuous predictions of line properties like strength and kinematics across the sky. Instrumental and calibration systematics are straightforward to include and infer. The model provides a natural trade-off between spatial resolution and S/N in a data-driven way. We apply this to Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) data of the Rosette Nebula, producing continuous maps of fluxes and kinematics for Balmer, nebular, and auroral lines, as well as weak C II and N II recombination lines, demonstrating the approach across three orders of magnitude in S/N, including in the very low-S/N regime. The method recovers identical morphologies across different lines tracing similar ionisation volumes, at varying resolutions set by the S/N. We additionally provide a general framework for building and fitting such models in JAX, suitable for many applications. The implementation is fast and memory efficient, scales to large data volumes as in LVM, and can be deployed on hardware accelerators.</description>

      <title>An automated probabilistic asteroid prediscovery pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an automated and probabilistic method to make prediscovery detections of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in archival survey images, with the goal of reducing orbital uncertainty immediately after discovery. We refit Minor Planet Center astrometry and propagate the full six-parameter covariance to survey epochs to define search regions. We build low-threshold source catalogs for viable images and evaluate every detected source in a search region as a candidate prediscovery. We eliminate false positives by refitting a new orbit to each candidate and probabilistically linking detections across images using a likelihood ratio. Applied to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) imaging, we identify approximately 3000 recently discovered NEAs with prediscovery potential, including a doubling of the observational arc for about 500. We use archival ZTF imaging to make prediscovery detections of the potentially hazardous asteroid 2021 DG1, extending its arc by 2.5 years and reducing future apparition sky-plane uncertainty from many degrees to arcseconds. We also recover 2025 FU24 nearly 7 years before its first known observation, when its sky-plane uncertainty covers hundreds of square degrees across thousands of ZTF images. The method is survey-agnostic and scalable, enabling rapid orbit refinement for new discoveries from Rubin, NEO Surveyor, and NEOMIR.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated X-ray Pulse Profile Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius $R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX 4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator. Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational lensing time delays with quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational fields of astrophysical bodies bend the light around them, creating multiple paths along which light from a distant source can arrive at Earth. Measuring the difference in photon arrival time along these different paths provides a means of determining the mass of the lensing system, which is otherwise difficult to constrain. This is particularly challenging in the case of microlensing, where the images produced by lensing cannot be individually resolved; existing proposals for detecting time delays in microlensed systems are significantly constrained due to the need for large photon flux and the loss of signal coherence when the angular diameter of the light source becomes too large.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach to measuring astrophysical time delays. Our method uses exponentially fewer photons than previous schemes, enabling observations that would otherwise be impossible. Our approach, which combines a quantum-inspired algorithm and quantum information processing technologies, saturates a provable lower bound on the number of photons required to find the time delay. Our scheme has multiple applications: we explore its use both in calibrating optical interferometric telescopes and in making direct mass measurements of ongoing microlensing events. To demonstrate the latter, we present a fiducial example of microlensed stellar flares sources in the Galactic Bulge. Though the number of photons produced by such events is small, we show that our photon-efficient scheme opens the possibility of directly measuring microlensing time delays using existing and near-future ground-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of the magnetic cataclysmic binary EF Eridani: Revealing complex magnetic accretion during a high state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of the polar EF Eri, obtained with SALT and the SAAO 1.9-m telescope during its recent emergence from a three-decade-long low state. The average spectrum shows strong emission from the Balmer lines (H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$) and He~\textsc{ii} 4686 \AA{}, along with weaker emission from the He~\textsc{i} lines and the Bowen fluorescence (C~\textsc{iii}/N~\textsc{iii}) blend at 4650 \AA{}. The emission lines redward of 5500 \AA{} transition to pure absorption at orbital phases $\sim$0.75--0.95, which we attribute to obscuration of the line-emitting region by the accretion stream. Trailed spectra of the emission lines reveal multicomponent structures consistent with other polars. In this first Doppler study of EF Eri, tomograms of the strongest lines (He~\textsc{ii} 4686 \AA{} and the Balmer lines), using both the standard and inside-out projections, identify three key emission regions: the irradiated face of the secondary star, the ballistic and threading regions of the accretion stream, and the magnetically confined flow. Our Doppler maps show not only the ballistic stream but also two unambiguous magnetic accretion flows, which is consistent with the presence of multiple magnetic accretion regions.</description>

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact, physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is publicly available at https://www.ideasearch.cn/.</description>

      <title>Direct Spectroscopy of 51 Eridani b with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-contrast direct spectroscopy of the low-mass, cool exoplanet 51 Eridani b (2-4 M$_\textrm{Jup}$, $\sim$750 K) using JWST / NIRSpec in a fixed-slit configuration (F290LP / G395H, $3-5\,\mu$m, R$\sim$2,700). A cross correlation analysis between the continuum-subtracted data and atmospheric forward models indicates a detection of molecular signals of planetary origin at $4.8\sigma$ at the expected position and velocity of the planet. The detection of the planetary signal is driven primarily by molecular features from methane and carbon monoxide, providing the first direct confirmation of these two molecules coexisting in chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of 51 Eridani b. A new comprehensive atmospheric model analysis shows consistency between the ground-based IFU spectroscopy and the NIRSpec data, with the best-fit model parameters: $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 800$^{+21.5}_{-55.5}$ K, $\log g$ = 3.75$^{+0.09}_{-0.37}$, $[\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}]$ = 0.7$^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$, $\textrm{C}/\textrm{O}$ = 0.458$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, $\log K_\mathrm{zz}$ = 3$^{+0.47}_{-0.73}$, $R_\mathrm{P}$ = 1.36$^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ $R_\mathrm{Jup}$, $f_\mathrm{hole}$ = 0.3$^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$, and the NIRSpec errorbar inflation parameter: $\hat{e}$ = 1.74$^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. We conclude with a discussion on the lessons learned between the fixed slit and IFU-based high contrast spectroscopic methods from our observing program, including some possibilities to improve the analysis method.</description>

      <title>PowerBin: Fast Adaptive Data Binning with Centroidal Power Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive binning is a crucial step in the analysis of large astronomical datasets, such as those from integral-field spectroscopy, to ensure a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for reliable model fitting. However, the widely used Voronoi-binning method and its variants suffer from two key limitations: they scale poorly with data size, often as O(N^2), creating a computational bottleneck for modern surveys, and they can produce undesirable non-convex or disconnected bins. I introduce PowerBin, a new algorithm that overcomes these issues. I frame the binning problem within the theory of optimal transport, for which the solution is a Centroidal Power Diagram (CPD), guaranteeing convex bins. Instead of formal CPD solvers, which are unstable with real data, I develop a fast and robust heuristic based on a physical analogy of packed soap bubbles. This method reliably enforces capacity constraints even for non-additive measures like S/N with correlated noise. I also present a new bin-accretion algorithm with O(N log N) complexity, removing the previous bottleneck. The combined PowerBin algorithm scales as O(N log N), making it about two orders of magnitude faster than previous methods on million-pixel datasets. I demonstrate its performance on a range of simulated and real data, showing it produces high-quality, convex tessellations with excellent S/N uniformity. The public Python implementation provides a fast, robust, and scalable tool for the analysis of modern astronomical data.</description>

      <title>Template-Free Gravitational Wave Detection with CWT-LSTM Autoencoders: A Case Study of Run-Dependent Calibration Effects in LIGO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10505v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents an unsupervised deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for template-free gravitational wave detection. We train and evaluate our model on LIGO H1 data from Observing Run 4 (O4, 2023-2024), comprising 126 confirmed gravitational wave events from the GWTC-4.0 catalog and 1991 noise segments. During development, we discovered that reconstruction errors from multi-run training (O1-O4) clustered by observing run rather than astrophysical parameters, revealing systematic batch effects from GWOSC's evolving calibration procedures. Following LIGO's established practice of per-run optimization, we adopted single-run (O4) training, which eliminated these batch effects and improved recall from 52% to 96% while maintaining 97% precision. The final model achieves 97.0% precision, 96.1% recall, F1-score 96.6%, and ROC-AUC 0.994 on 102 test signals and 399 noise segments. The reconstruction error distribution shows clean separation between noise (mean 0.48) and signals (mean 0.77). This unsupervised, template-free approach demonstrates that anomaly detection can achieve performance competitive with supervised methods while enabling discovery of signals with unexpected morphologies. Our identification and resolution of cross-run batch effects provides methodological guidance for future machine learning applications to multi-epoch gravitational wave datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have opened a new frontier in the discovery and characterization of transients. While photometric light curves provide broad temporal coverage, spectroscopic observations remain crucial for physical interpretation and source classification. However, existing spectral analysis methods -- often reliant on template fitting or parametric models -- are limited in their ability to capture the complex and evolving spectra characteristic of such sources, which are sometimes only available at low resolution. In this work, we introduce SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network designed to learn robust representations of optical spectra from transients. Our model combines multi-scale convolution kernels and multi-scale pooling to extract features from preprocessed spectra in a hierarchical and interpretable manner. We train and validate SpectraNet on low-resolution time-series spectra obtained from the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) and other instruments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in classification. Furthermore, in redshift prediction tasks, SpectraNet achieves a root mean squared relative redshift error of 0.02, highlighting its effectiveness in precise regression tasks as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to investigating axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) by studying their potential conversion into X-rays within the Sun's atmospheric magnetic field. Utilizing high-sensitivity data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) collected during the 2020 solar minimum, along with advanced solar atmospheric magnetic field models, we establish a new limit on the axion-photon coupling strength $g_{a\gamma}\lesssim 7.3\times 10^{-12}$~GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% CL for axion masses $m_a\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$\,eV. This constraint surpasses current ground-based experimental limits, studying previously unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to masses of $m_a\lesssim 3.4\times 10^{-4}$\,eV. These findings mark a significant advancement in our ability to probe axion properties and strengthen indirect searches for dark matter candidates.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction are essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE model demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a 12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and 1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput, reaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant inference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost (under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show CAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible, and cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community. The code is accessible at https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/AI-for-Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Auriga Superstars: Improving the resolution and fidelity of stellar dynamics in cosmological galaxy simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have become an indispensable tool to understand galaxies. However, computational constraints still severely limit their numerical resolution. This not only restricts the sampling of the stellar component and its direct comparison to detailed observations, but also the precision with which it is evolved. To overcome these problems we introduce the \emph{Superstars} method. This method increases the stellar mass resolution in cosmological galaxy simulations in a computationally inexpensive way for a fixed dark matter and gas resolution without altering any global properties of the simulated galaxies. We demonstrate the \emph{Superstars} method for a Milky Way-like galaxy of the Auriga project, improving the stellar mass resolution by factors of $8$ and $64$ at an additional cost of only $10\%$ and $500\%$, respectively. We show and quantify that this improves the sampling of the stellar population in the disc and halo without changing the properties of the central galaxy or its satellites, unlike simulations that change the resolution of all components (gas, dark matter, stars). Moreover, the better stellar mass resolution reduces numerical heating of the stellar disc in its outskirts and keeps substructures in the stellar disc and inner halo more coherent. It also makes lower mass and lower surface brightness structures in the stellar halo more visible. The \emph{Superstars} method is straightforward to incorporate in any cosmological galaxy simulation that does not resolve individual stars.</description>

      <title>Toward Low-Latency, High-Fidelity Calibration of the LIGO Detectors with Enhanced Monitoring Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable calibration of the Advanced LIGO detectors has enabled a plethora of gravitational-wave discoveries in the detectors' first decade of operation, starting with the ground-breaking discovery, GW150914. In the first decade of operation, the calibrated strain data from Advanced LIGO detectors has become available at a lower latency and with more reliability. In this paper, we discuss the relevant history of Advanced LIGO calibration and introduce new tools that have been developed to enable faster and more robust calibrated strain data products in the fourth observing run (O4). We discuss improvements to the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of the low-latency calibration pipeline as well as the development of a new tool for monitoring the LIGO detector calibration in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze follow-up, higher resolution ($R$ $\sim$ 70) $H$ and $K$ band integral field spectroscopy of the superjovian exoplanet HIP 99770 b with SCExAO/CHARIS. Our new data recover the companion at a high signal-to-noise ratio in both bandpasses and more than double the astrometric baseline for its orbital motion. Jointly modeling HIP 99770 b's position and the star's astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia yields orbital parameters consistent with those from the discovery paper, albeit with smaller errors, and a slight preference for a smaller semimajor axis ($\sim$15.7--15.8 au)and a larger eccentricity ($\sim$0.28--0.29), disfavoring a circular orbit. We revise its dynamical mass slightly downwards to 15.0$_{-4.4}^{+4.5}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a flat prior and 13.1$_{-5.2}^{+4.8}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a more standard log-uniform mass prior, where the inclusion of its relative radial-velocity measurement is primarily responsible for these changes. We find consistent results for HIP 99770 b's dynamical mass including recent VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry, albeit with a slightly smaller, better constrained eccentricity of $e$ $\sim$ 0.22$^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$. HIP 99770 b is a $\sim$ 1300 K object at the L/T transition with a gravity intermediate between that of the HR 8799 planets and older, more massive field brown dwarfs with similar temperatures but with hints of equilibrium chemistry. HIP 99770 b is particularly well suited for spectroscopic follow up with Roman CGI during the technology demonstration phase at 730 nm to further constrain its metallicity and chemistry; JWST thermal infrared observations could likewise explore the planet's carbon chemistry, metallicity, and clouds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a web-based application designed to simulate rotational light curves of small airless Solar System bodies under user-defined geometrical and physical conditions. The tool integrates both physical and empirical photometric models and enables users to input custom shape models, surface properties, and viewing geometries. A dedicated module also computes projected silhouettes at the epoch of stellar occultations, allowing direct comparison with observed chords. The application, developed in Python and Django, has been validated using well-characterized targets such as (136108) Haumea, (101955) Bennu, and (433) Eros, showing excellent agreement between synthetic and observed light curves and silhouettes. Beyond standard light curve simulations, the tool supports scenarios including surface heterogeneity, non-principal axis rotation (tumbling), and phase-angle effects. This flexible and accessible platform provides a powerful resource for interpreting photometric data, supporting ongoing observation campaigns, and aiding future mission planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We announce V. 2025-08-08 of the Chroma+ suite of stellar atmosphere and spectrum modelling codes for fast, approximate, effectively platform-independent stellar spectrum synthesis, written in a number of free well-supported programming languages. The Chroma+ suite now computes the emergent surface intensity and flux distributions and the hydrostatic pressure structure assuming a spherical atmosphere rather than local flatness by implementing the analytic formal solution of the 1D spherical radiative transfer equation of Chapman (1966} based on an integration factor. We present our adaptation and discretization of the solution and demonstrate the resulting impact of our sphericity treatment on a number of computed observables, including exo-planet transit light-curves. All codes are available from the OpenStars www site: www.ap.smu.ca/OpenStars.</description>
