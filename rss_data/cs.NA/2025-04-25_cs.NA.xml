      <title>Universal Methods for Nonlinear Spectral Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear spectral problems arise across a range of fields, including mechanical vibrations, fluid-solid interactions, and photonic crystals. Discretizing infinite-dimensional nonlinear spectral problems often introduces significant computational challenges, particularly spectral pollution and invisibility, which can distort or obscure the true underlying spectrum. We present the first general, convergent computational method for computing the spectra and pseudospectra of nonlinear spectral problems. Our approach uses new results on nonlinear injection moduli and requires only minimal continuity assumptions: specifically, continuity with respect to the gap metric on operator graphs, making it applicable to a broad class of problems. We use the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which has recently been used to resolve the classical linear problem, to systematically classify the computational complexity of nonlinear spectral problems. Our results establish the optimality of the method and reveal that Hermiticity does not necessarily simplify the computational complexity of these nonlinear problems. Comprehensive examples -- including nonlinear shifts, Klein--Gordon equations, wave equations with acoustic boundary conditions, time-fractional beam equations, and biologically inspired delay differential equations -- demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and broad applicability of our methodology.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Finite Element DtN Method for the Acoustic-Elastic Interaction Problem in Periodic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a time-harmonic acoustic plane wave incident onto an elastic body with an unbounded periodic surface. The medium above the surface is supposed to be filled with a homogeneous compressible inviscid air/fluid of constant mass density, while the elastic body is assumed to be isotropic and linear. By introducing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operators for acoustic and elastic waves simultaneously, the model is formulated as an acoustic-elastic interaction problem in periodic structures. Based on a duality argument, an a posteriori error estimate is derived for the associated truncated finite element approximation. The a posteriori error estimate consists of the finite element approximation error and the truncation error of two different DtN operators, where the latter decays exponentially with respect to the truncation parameter. Based on the a posteriori error, an adaptive finite element algorithm is proposed for solving the acoustic-elastic interaction problem in periodic structures. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>On Josephy-Halley method for generalized equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical third-order Halley iteration to the setting of generalized equations of the form \[ 0 \in f(x) + F(x), \] where \(f\colon X\longrightarrow Y\) is twice continuously Fr\'echet-differentiable on Banach spaces and \(F\colon X\tto Y\) is a set-valued mapping with closed graph. Building on predictor-corrector framework, our scheme first solves a partially linearized inclusion to produce a predictor \(u_{k+1}\), then incorporates second-order information in a Halley-type corrector step to obtain \(x_{k+1}\). Under metric regularity of the linearization at a reference solution and H\"older continuity of \(f''\), we prove that the iterates converge locally with order \(2+p\) (cubically when \(p=1\)). Moreover, by constructing a suitable scalar majorant function we derive semilocal Kantorovich-type conditions guaranteeing well-definedness and R-cubic convergence from an explicit neighbourhood of the initial guess. Numerical experiments-including one- and two-dimensional test problems confirm the theoretical convergence rates and illustrate the efficiency of the Josephy-Halley method compared to its Josephy-Newton counterpart.</description>

      <title>Fully-Mixed Virtual Element Method for the Biot Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poroelasticity describes the interaction of deformation and fluid flow in saturated porous media. A fully-mixed formulation of Biot's poroelasticity problem has the advantage of producing a better approximation of the Darcy velocity and stress field, as well as satisfying local mass and momentum conservation. In this work, we focus on a novel four-fields Virtual Element discretization of Biot's equations. The stress symmetry is strongly imposed in the definition of the discrete space, thus avoiding the use of an additional Lagrange multiplier. A complete a priori analysis is performed, showing the robustness of the proposed numerical method with respect to limiting material properties. The first order convergence of the lowest-order fully-discrete numerical method, which is obtained by coupling the spatial approximation with the backward Euler time-advancing scheme, is confirmed by a complete 3D numerical validation. A well known poroelasticity benchmark is also considered to assess the robustness properties and computational performance.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed features in supervised machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning involves approximating an unknown functional relationship from a limited dataset of features and corresponding labels. The classical approach to feature-based machine learning typically relies on applying linear regression to standardized features, without considering their physical meaning. This may limit model explainability, particularly in scientific applications. This study proposes a physics-informed approach to feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the context of explainable machine learning.</description>

      <title>Rescaling and unconstrained minimisation of convex quadratic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a class of piecewise-fractional maps arising from the introduction of an invariance under rescaling into convex quadratic maps. The subsequent maps are quasiconvex, and pseudoconvex on specific convex cones; they can be optimised via exact line search along admissible directions, and the iterates then inherit a bidimensional optimality property. We study the minimisation of such relaxed maps via coordinate descents with gradient-based rules, placing a special emphasis on coordinate directions verifying a maximum-alignment property in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces related to the underlying positive-semidefinite matrices. In this setting, we illustrate that accounting for the optimal rescaling of the iterates can in certain situations substantially accelerate the unconstrained minimisation of convex quadratic maps.</description>

      <title>Convolution Quadrature for the quasilinear subdiffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Convolution Quadrature (CQ) scheme for the quasilinear subdiffusion equation of order $\alpha$ and supply it with the fast and oblivious implementation. In particular, we find a condition for the CQ to be admissible and discretize the spatial part of the equation with the Finite Element Method. We prove the unconditional stability and convergence of the scheme and find a bound on the error. Our estimates are globally optimal for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and pointwise for $\alpha\geq 1/2$ in the sense that they reduce to the well-known results for the linear equation. For the semilinear case, our estimates are optimal both globally and locally. As a passing result, we also obtain a discrete Gr\"onwall inequality for the CQ, which is a crucial ingredient in our convergence proof based on the energy method. The paper is concluded with numerical examples verifying convergence and computation time reduction when using fast and oblivious quadrature.</description>

      <title>Analysis and improvement of a semi-Lagrangian exponential scheme for the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study and extend a class of semi-Lagrangian exponential methods, which combine exponential time integration techniques, suitable for integrating stiff linear terms, with a semi-Lagrangian treatment of nonlinear advection terms. Partial differential equations involving both processes arise for instance in atmospheric circulation models. Through a truncation error analysis, we show that previously formulated semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes are limited to first-order accuracy due to the approximation of the integration factor acting on the discretization of the linear term; we then formulate a new discretization leading to second-order accuracy. Also, a detailed stability study is conducted to compare several Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes, as well as a well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method, which is used in operational atmospheric models. Numerical simulations of the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere are performed to assess the orders of convergence, stability properties, and computational cost of each method. The proposed second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential method was shown to be more stable and accurate than the previously formulated schemes of the same class at the expense of larger wall-clock times; however, the method is more stable and has a similar cost compared to the well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method; therefore, it is a competitive candidate for potential operational applications in atmospheric circulation modeling.</description>

      <title>A Random Integration Algorithm for High-dimensional Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel random integration algorithm that boasts both high convergence order and polynomial tractability for functions characterized by sparse frequencies or rapidly decaying Fourier coefficients. Specifically, for integration in periodic isotropic Sobolev space and the isotropic Sobolev space with compact support, our approach attains a nearly optimal root mean square error (RMSE) bound. In contrast to previous nearly optimal algorithms, our method exhibits polynomial tractability, ensuring that the number of samples does not scale exponentially with increasing dimensions. Our integration algorithm also enjoys nearly optimal bound for weighted Korobov space. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied without the need for prior knowledge of weights, distinguishing it from the component-by-component algorithm. For integration in the Wiener algebra, the sample complexity of our algorithm is independent of the decay rate of Fourier coefficients. The effectiveness of the integration is confirmed through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Superlinear Convergence of GMRES for clustered eigenvalues and its application to least squares problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to understand the superlinear convergence behavior of the GMRES method when the coefficient matrix has clustered eigenvalues. In order to understand the phenomenon, we analyze the convergence using the Vandermonde matrix which is defined using the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix. Although eigenvalues alone cannot explain the convergence, they may provide an upper bound of the residual, together with the right hand side vector and the eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix. We show that when the coefficient matrix is diagonalizable, if the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are clustered, the upper bound of the convergence curve shows superlinear convergence, when the norm of the matrix obtained by decomposing the right hand side vector into the eigenvector components is not so large. We apply the analysis to explain the convergence of inner-iteration preconditioned GMRES for least squares problems.</description>

      <title>Higher order error estimates for regularization of inverse problems under non-additive noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we derive higher order error estimates for inverse problems distorted by non-additive noise, in terms of Bregman distances. The results are obtained by means of a novel source condition, inspired by the dual problem. Specifically, we focus on variational regularization having the Kullback-Leibler divergence as data-fidelity, and a convex penalty term. In this framework, we provide an interpretation of the new source condition, and present error estimates also when a variational formulation of the source condition is employed. We show that this approach can be extended to variational regularization that incorporates more general convex data fidelities.</description>

Abstract: A deep approximation is an approximating function defined by composing more than one layer of simple functions. We study deep approximations of functions of one variable using layers consisting of low-degree polynomials or simple conformal transformations. We show that deep approximations to $|x|$ on $[-1,1]$ achieve exponential convergence with respect to the degrees of freedom. Computational experiments suggest that a composite of two and three polynomial layers can give more accurate approximations than a single polynomial with the same number of coefficients. We also study the related problem of reducing the Runge phenomenon by composing polynomials with conformal transformations.</description>

      <title>The Resonance Bias Framework: Resonance, Structure, and Arithmetic in Quadrature Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the trapezoidal rule for periodic functions on uniform grids and show that the quadrature error exhibits a rich deterministic structure, beyond traditional asymptotic or statistical interpretations. Focusing on the prototype function f(x) = sin^2(2 pi k x), we derive an analytical expression for the error governed by a resonance function chi_P(y), closely related to the Dirichlet kernel, roots of unity, and discrete Fourier analysis on the group Z/PZ. This function acts as a spectral filter, connecting the integration error to arithmetic properties such as k/P and geometric phase cancellation, visualized as vector averaging on the unit circle. We introduce the Resonance Bias Framework (RBF), a generalization to arbitrary smooth periodic functions, leading to the error representation B_P[f] = sum_{k != 0} c_k chi_P(k/P). Although this is mathematically equivalent to the classical aliasing sum, it reveals a deeper mechanism: the quadrature error arises from structured resonance rather than random aliasing noise. The RBF thus provides an interpretable framework for understanding integration errors at finite resolution, grounded in number theory and geometry.</description>

      <title>Quasitubal Tensor Algebra Over Separable Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tubal tensor framework provides a clean and effective algebraic setting for tensor computations, supporting matrix-mimetic features like Singular Value Decomposition and Eckart-Young-like optimality results. Underlying the tubal tensor framework is a view of a tensor as a matrix of finite sized tubes. In this work, we lay the mathematical and computational foundations for working with tensors with infinite size tubes: matrices whose elements are elements from a separable Hilbert space. A key challenge is that existence of important desired matrix-mimetic features of tubal tensors rely on the existence of a unit element in the ring of tubes. Such unit element cannot exist for tubes which are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We sidestep this issue by embedding the tubal space in a commutative unital C*-algebra of bounded operators. The resulting quasitubal algebra recovers the structural properties needed for decomposition and low-rank approximation. In addition to laying the theoretical groundwork for working with tubal tensors with infinite dimensional tubes, we discuss computational aspects of our construction, and provide a numerical illustration where we compute a finite dimensional approximation to a infinitely-sized synthetic tensor using our theory. We believe our theory opens new exciting avenues for applying matrix mimetic tensor framework in the context of inherently infinite dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed up in Monte Carlo sampling through Radial Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is guaranteed to converge exponentially to a given target probability distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-V(x)}$ on non-compact spaces if augmented by an appropriate radial update. In this work we present a simple way to derive efficient radial updates meeting the necessary requirements for any potential $V$. We reduce the problem to finding a substitution for the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that the effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with $z\rightarrow\pm\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence. We show that choosing this update from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions yields very good results. We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Diffuse Domain Approximation with Transmission-Type Boundary Conditions I: Asymptotic Analysis and Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse domain methods (DDMs) have garnered significant attention for approximating solutions to partial differential equations on complex geometries. These methods implicitly represent the geometry by replacing the sharp boundary interface with a diffuse layer of thickness $\varepsilon$, which scales with the minimum grid size. This approach reformulates the original equations on an extended regular domain, incorporating boundary conditions through singular source terms. In this work, we conduct a matched asymptotic analysis of a DDM for a two-sided problem with transmission-type Robin boundary conditions. Our results show that, in the one dimensional space, the solution of the diffuse domain approximation asymptotically converges to the solution of the original problem, with exactly first-order accuracy in $\varepsilon$. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations that validate and illustrate the analytical result.</description>

      <title>A Robust Model-Based Approach for Continuous-Time Policy Evaluation with Unknown L\'evy Process Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a model-based framework for continuous-time policy evaluation (CTPE) in reinforcement learning, incorporating both Brownian and L\'evy noise to model stochastic dynamics influenced by rare and extreme events. Our approach formulates the policy evaluation problem as solving a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) for the value function with unknown coefficients. A key challenge in this setting is accurately recovering the unknown coefficients in the stochastic dynamics, particularly when driven by L\'evy processes with heavy tail effects. To address this, we propose a robust numerical approach that effectively handles both unbiased and censored trajectory datasets. This method combines maximum likelihood estimation with an iterative tail correction mechanism, improving the stability and accuracy of coefficient recovery. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound for the policy evaluation error based on coefficient recovery error. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in recovering heavy-tailed L\'evy dynamics and verify the theoretical error analysis in policy evaluation.</description>
