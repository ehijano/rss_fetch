      <title>Coherent manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper defines coherent manifolds and discusses their properties and their application in quantum mechanics. Every coherent manifold with a large group of symmetries gives rise to a Hilbert space, the completed quantum space of $Z$, which contains a distinguished family of coherent states labeled by the points of the manifold.
  The second quantization map in quantum field theory is generalized to quantization operators on arbitrary coherent manifolds. It is shown how the Schr\"odinger equation on any such completed quantum space can be solved in terms of computations only involving the coherent product. In particular, this applies to a description of Bosonic Fock spaces as completed quantum spaces of a class of coherent manifolds called Klauder spaces.</description>

      <title>Intertwiners of representations of untwisted quantum affine algebras and Yangians revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss applications of the $q$-characters to the computation of the $R$-matrices. In particular, we describe the $R$-matrix acting in the tensor square of the first fundamental representation of E$_8$ and in a number of other cases, where the decomposition of the tensor squares with respect to non-affine quantum algebra has non-trivial multiplicities. As an illustration, we also recover $R$-matrices acting in the multiplicity free-case on the tensor squares of the first fundamental representations of all other types of untwisted quantum affine algebras. The answer is written in terms of projectors related to the decomposition of the tensor squares with respect to non-affine quantum algebras. Then we give explicit expressions for the $R$-matrices in terms of matrix units with respect to a natural basis (except for the case of E$_8$). We give similar formulas for the Yangian $R$-matrices.</description>

      <title>Principaloid bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generalisation of principal bundles -- principaloid bundles: These are fibre bundles $\pi:P\to B$ where the typical fibre is the arrow manifold $G$ of a Lie groupoid $G\rightrightarrows M$ and the structure group is reduced to the latter's group of bisections. Each such bundle canonically comes with a bundle map $D:P\to F$ to another fibre bundle $F$ over the base $B$, with typical fibre $M$. Examples of principaloid bundles include ordinary principal $\underline G$-bundles, obtained for $G:=\underline G\rightrightarrows\bullet$, bundles associated to them, obtained for action groupoids $G:=\underline G\ltimes M$, and general fibre bundles if $G$ is a pair groupoid.
  While $\pi$ is far from being a principal $G$-bundle, we prove that $D$ is one. Connections on the principaloid bundle $\pi$ are thus required to be $G$-invariant Ehresmann connections. In the three examples mentioned above, this reproduces the usual types of connection for each of them. In a local description over a trivialising cover $\{O_i\}$ of $B$, the connection gives rise to Lie algebroid-valued objects living over bundle trivialisations $\{O_i\times M\}$ of $F$. Their behaviour under bundle automorphisms, including gauge transformations, is studied in detail.
  Finally, we construct the Atiyah-Ehresmann groupoid ${\rm At}(P)\rightrightarrows F$ which governs symmetries of $P$, this time mapping distinct $D$-fibres to one another in general. It is a fibre-bundle object in the category of Lie groupoids, with typical fibre $G\rightrightarrows M$ and base $B\times B\rightrightarrows B$. We show that those of its bisections which project to bisections of its base are in a one-to-one correspondence with automorphisms of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Velocity Averaging for the Wigner Kinetic Equation in the Semiclassical Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the possibility of applying the velocity averaging theorems in [F. Golse, P.-L. Lions, B. Perthame, R. Sentis: J. Funct. Anal. 76(1):110--125, 1988] to the Wigner equation governing the quantum evolution of the Wigner transform of quantum density operators. Our first main results address the case of the Wigner function of a special class of density operators associated to mixed states, whose Hilbert-Schmidt norm is of order $\hbar^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the space dimension and $\hbar$ the reduced Planck constant. In space dimension $d=1$, we prove that the density function belongs to the Sobolev space $H^s(\mathbb R)$ for some $s&gt;0$. In the case of pure states, we first obtain a characterization of the Wigner transform of rank-one quantum density operators, and apply this characterization (1) to analyze a rather general setting in which velocity averaging cannot apply to the Wigner functions of a family of rank-one density operators whose evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation, and (2) to obtain a quick derivation of Madelung's system of quantum hydrodynamic equations. This derivation provides a physical explanation of one key assumption used in the proof of the negative result (1) described above.</description>

      <title>$T\overline{T}$ Deformation: Introduction and Some Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation, an irrelevant yet solvable deformation of quantum field theories defined via the quadratic form of the energy-momentum tensor. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. Classically, $T\bar{T}$ deformation manifests through multiple geometric interpretations, notably random geometry, Jackiw-Teitelboim-like gravity, and uniform light-cone gauge frameworks. For quantum aspects, the deformation introduces notable features such as non-locality, UV-IR mixing, solvable renormalization structures, and intriguing modifications to correlation functions and entanglement properties. Furthermore, the paper examines the profound relationship between $T\bar{T}$ deformation and holography, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holography proposal and holographic entanglement entropy. Connections to string theory through single-trace deformations and their holographic duals further reveal the deformed structure of the worldsheet. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $T\bar{T}$-like deformation.</description>

      <title>On Sufficient and Necessary Criteria of Multipartite Quantum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the generalized Bloch representation, we study the separability and genuine multipartite entanglement of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum states. Some sufficient and some necessary criteria are presented. For certain states, these criteria together are both sufficient and necessary. Detailed examples show that our criteria are better than some existing ones in identifying entanglement. Based on these criteria, the largest separable ball around the maximally mixed state for arbitrary multi-qubit systems is found, and it is proved that its radius is the constant 1. Furthermore, the criteria in this paper can be implemented experimentally.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling of resonant behavior in scattering problems through adaptive rational approximation and sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes novel algorithms for the identification of (almost-)resonant behavior in scattering problems. Our methods, relying on rational approximation, aim at building surrogate models of what we call "field amplification", defined as the norm of the solution operator of the scattering problem, which we express through boundary-integral equations. To provide our techniques with theoretical foundations, we first derive results linking the field amplification to the spectral properties of the operator that defines the scattering problem. Such results are then used to justify the use of rational approximation in the surrogate-modeling task. Some of our proposed methods apply rational approximation in a "standard" way, building a rational approximant for either the solution operator directly or, in the interest of computational efficiency, for a randomly "sketched" version of it. Our other "hybrid" approaches are more innovative, combining rational-approximation-assisted root-finding with approximation using radial basis functions. Three key features of our methods are that (i) they are agnostic of the strategy used to discretize the scattering problem, (ii) they do not require any computations involving non-real wavenumbers, and (iii) they can adjust to different settings through the use of adaptive sampling strategies. We carry out some numerical experiments involving 2D scatterers to compare our approaches. In our tests, two of our approaches (one standard, one hybrid) emerge as the best performers, with one or the other being preferable, depending on whether emphasis is placed on accuracy or efficiency.</description>

Abstract: We explore the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for an operator field in small dimensions. In dimensions three and four, we find tensorial conditions for an operator field $L$, similar to a nilpotent Jordan block, to possess local coordinates in which $L$ takes a strictly upper triangular form. We prove the Tempesta-Tondo conjecture for higher order brackets of Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis type.</description>

      <title>Analysis of linear Boussinesq-type models coupled with static interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a new approach to analyze the coupling of linear Boussinesq and Saint-Venant shallow water wave equations in the case where the interface remains at a constant position in space. We propose a one-way coupling model as a reference, which allows us to obtain an analytical solution, prove the well-posedness of the original coupled model and compute what we call the coupling error-a quantity that depends solely on the choice of transmission conditions at the interface. We prove that this coupling error is asymptotically small for a certain class of data and discuss its role as a proxy for the full error with respect to the 3D water wave problem. Additionally, we highlight that this error can be easily computed in other scenarios. We show that the coupling error consists of reflected waves and argue that this explains some previously unexplained spurious oscillations reported in the literature. Finally, we prove the well-posedness of the half-line linear Boussinesq problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory, Gravity and Higher Order Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that quantum theory is non-differentiable, while general relativity is built on the assumption of differentiability sources an incompatibility between quantum theory and gravity. Higher order geometry addresses this issue directly by extending differential geometry, such that it can be applied to theories that are non-differentiable, but have a certain degree of H\"older regularity. As this includes the path integral formulation of quantum theory, it provides a natural mathematical framework for describing the interplay between gravity and quantum theory. In this article, we review the motivation for and the basic features of this framework and point towards future developments.</description>

Abstract: Sch\"afke and Schmidt established that the asymptotics of the coefficients of the local solution to some linear differential equation is related to global structures of solutions. The Heun class equations have the accessory parameters, and we investigate the polynomials whose variable is the accessory parameter which appears as the coefficients of the local solution. By calculating the zeros of the polynomials numerically, we obtain the data of the spectral related to the Heun class equations numerically.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that the unitary operation on the system's subspace uniquely determines the corresponding unitary operator on the environment's subspace. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we identify the requirements that local operations must satisfy to ensure that the eternal black hole states remain static in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants in the Solutions of Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As in other partial differential equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions when one integrates Einstein's equations, or more generally field equations of any other gravity. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can in principle be measured is a non-trivial matter. Concentrating on the case of constants, one usually identifies them as conserved mass, momentum, angular momentum, center of mass, or some other hairs of the solution. This can be done via the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)-type construction based on pure geometry; and the solution is typically a black hole. Hence, one talks about the black hole mass and angular momentum etc. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings: First of all, the physical interpretation of the constants of a given geometry depends not only on pure geometry, i.e. the metric, but also on the theory under-consideration. This becomes quite important especially when there is a cosmological constant. Secondly, one usually assigns the maximally symmetric spacetime, say the flat or the (anti)-de Sitter spacetime, to have a zero mass and angular momentum and linear momentum. This declares the maximally symmetric spacetime to be the vacuum of the theory, but such an assignment depends on the coordinates in the ADM-type constructions and their extensions: in fact, one can introduce large gauge transformations (new coordinates) which map, say, the flat spacetime to flat spacetime but the resultant flat spacetime can have a nontrivial mass and angular momentum, if the new coordinates are such that the metric components do not decay properly. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation within a specified class. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. We illustrate our presentation with three- and four-dimensional spin chains of difference form with local interactions. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.</description>

Using Bethe ansatz, we compute stationary large deviations for the joint statistics of the current of first and second class particles. At large scales, the generating function of the joint cumulants shows an unexpected connection to current fluctuations of TASEP with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>A Simple Description of the Hyperk\"{a}hler Structure of the Cotangent Bundle of Projective Space via Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization identifies the cotangent bundle of projective space with the (non-Hermitian) rank-$1$ projections of a Hilbert space. We use this identification to study the natural geometric structures of these cotangent bundles and those of Grassmanians. In particular, we show that the quantization map is an isometric and complex embedding $T^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})\backslash\{0\}.$ Here, the metric on the domain is the hyperk\"{a}hler metric and the metric on the codomain is the one whose K\"{a}hler potential is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. The K\"{a}hler potential pulled back to $T^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ equals the trace-class norm. Using this, we give a complete, simple and explicit description of the hyperk\"{a}hler structure. Our constructions are functorial, coordinate-free and reduction-free.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic correlation inequalities for finite times and transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated in [A. Dechant, J. Garnier-Brun, S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 167101 (2023)], showing how the decay of correlations in Langevin dynamics is bounded by short-time fluctuations and dissipation. Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.</description>

      <title>Field analogue of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01697v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a field extension of the classical elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The model is defined in two different ways which lead to the same result. The first one is via the trace of a chain product of $L$-matrices which allows one to introduce the Hamiltonian of the model and to show that the model is gauge equivalent to a classical elliptic spin chain. In this way, one obtains a lattice field analogue of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with continuous time. The second method is based on investigation of general elliptic families of solutions to the 2D Toda equation. We derive equations of motion for their poles, which turn out to be difference equations in space with a lattice spacing $\eta$, together with a zero curvature representation for them. We also show that the equations of motion are Hamiltonian. The obtained system of equations can be naturally regarded as a field generalization of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. Its lattice version coincides with the model introduced via the first method. The limit $\eta \to 0$ is shown to give the field extension of the Calogero-Moser model known in the literature. The fully discrete version of this construction is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03495v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation at positive density, that is, for a bounded solution not tending to 0 at infinity. We focus on infinite ground states, which are by definition minimizers of the energy under local perturbations. When the Fourier transform of the interaction potential takes negative values we prove the existence of a phase transition at high density, where the constant solution ceases to be a ground state. The analysis requires mixing techniques from elliptic PDE theory and statistical mechanics, in order to deal with a large class of interaction potentials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a theory for gravity coupled with scalar, SU$(n)$ and spinor fields on manifolds with null-boundary. We perform the symplectic reduction of the space of boundary fields and give the constraints of the theory in terms of local functionals of boundary vielbein and connection. For the three different couplings, the analysis of the constraint algebra shows that the set of constraints does not form a first class system.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>

      <title>Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02736v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two centuries and more particularly in the last decades, the geometry of foams has become an important research domain, in mathematics, physics, material sciences and biology. Most of the simplest geometrical observations of bubble clusters have long resisted rigorous mathematical proofs. Geometries can even get more complicated if immiscible fluids are considered. Although they have to fulfill Plateau's laws like soap bubble clusters if the surface tensions are close to unity, this is not the case in general. In 1996, Frederick J. Almgren asked whether there is "any stable cluster of bubbles in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with some bubble being topologically a torus". We propose to answer the latter numerically with simple numerical examples. We build stable soap bubble clusters with a triple torus bubble, a fivefold torus bubble or an elevenfold torus bubble. The construction uses the geometry of a simple immiscible fluids cluster with a torus bubble.</description>

      <title>Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the quantum entropy (QE) of a system increases due to measurements, it leads to the loss of certain information, part of which may be recoverable. We define Information Loss (IL) as a function of the density matrix through quantum entropy to effectively represent this relationship between gain and loss. For example, if the quantum entropy of a system increases from zero to 2ln2, its information loss rises from zero to 75 percent. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it acquires the highest possible gain in entropy and the maximal loss of information. We analyze the QE and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, multi-qubit systems such as in quantum teleportation, GHZ and W states, as well as the two-qubit Werner mixed states, focusing on their dependence on parameters like polarization bias. We notice that the data exchange between the two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information even years later, indicating that the associated quantum entropy can be removed years later, which implies a possible explanation linked to quantum non-locality. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner state yields the same minimal entropy gain (ln2) and an equal minimal information loss (50 percent).</description>

      <title>Structure of Virasoro tensor categories at central charge $13-6p-6p^{-1}$ for integers $p &gt; 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.02170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O}_c$ be the category of finite-length central-charge-$c$ modules for the Virasoro Lie algebra whose composition factors are irreducible quotients of reducible Verma modules. Recently, it has been shown that $\mathcal{O}_c$ admits vertex algebraic tensor category structure for any $c\in\mathbb{C}$. Here, we determine the structure of this tensor category when $c=13-6p-6p^{-1}$ for an integer $p&gt;1$. For such $c$, we prove that $\mathcal{O}_{c}$ is rigid, and we construct projective covers of irreducible modules in a natural tensor subcategory $\mathcal{O}_{c}^0$. We then compute all tensor products involving irreducible modules and their projective covers. Using these tensor product formulas, we show that $\mathcal{O}_c$ has a semisimplification which, as an abelian category, is the Deligne product of two tensor subcategories that are tensor equivalent to the Kazhdan-Lusztig categories for affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at levels $-2+p^{\pm 1}$. Next, as a straightforward consequence of the braided tensor category structure on $\mathcal{O}_c$ together with the theory of vertex operator algebra extensions, we rederive known results for triplet vertex operator algebras $\mathcal{W}(p)$, including rigidity, fusion rules, and construction of projective covers. Finally, we prove a recent conjecture of Negron that $\mathcal{O}_c^0$ is braided tensor equivalent to the $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$-equivariantization of the category of $\mathcal{W}(p)$-modules.</description>

      <title>An Achievable Rate Region for $3-$User Classical-Quantum Broadcast Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of communicating on a $3\mhyphen$user classical-quantum broadcast channel. We undertake an information theoretic study and focus on the problem of characterizing an inner bound to its capacity region. We design a new coding scheme based \textit{partitioned coset codes} - an ensemble of codes possessing algebraic properties. Analyzing its information-theoretic performance, we characterize a new inner bound. We identify examples for which the derived inner bound is strictly larger than that achievable using IID random codes.
  Proceeding further, we incorporate Sen's technique of tilting smoothing and augmentation to perform simultaneous decoding via a simultaneous decoding POVM and thereby characterize a further enlarged achievable rate region for communicating classical bits over the $3-$user classical-quantum broadcast channel. Finally, in our last step, we characterize a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of the $3-$user classical-quantum broadcast channel that subsumes all previous known inner bounds by combining the conventional unstructured IID codes with structured coset code strategies.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Calabi-Yau Crystals in BPS States Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of BPS D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles of a general toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We evaluate the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations. Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in quiver gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general black box theorem that ensures convergence of a sequence of stationary Markov processes, provided a few assumptions are satisfied. This theorem relies on a control of the resolvents of the sequence of Markov processes, and on a suitable characterization of the resolvents of the limit. One major advantage of this approach is that it circumvents the use of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: for instance, we deduce in a rather simple way that the stationary fluctuations of the one-dimensional zero-range process converge to the stochastic heat equation. More importantly, it allows to establish results that were probably out of reach of existing methods: using the black box result, we are able to prove that the stationary fluctuations of a discrete model of ordered interfaces, that was considered previously in the statistical physics literature, converge to a system of reflected stochastic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg dynamics of mixed quantum-classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of interacting quantum and classical systems in the Heisenberg representation. Unlike the usual construction in standard quantum mechanics, mixed quantum-classical systems involve the interplay of unitary operators acting on the quantum observables and the Lagrangian trajectories sweeping the classical degrees of freedom. This interplay reflects an intricate structure which is made particularly challenging by the backreaction excerpted on the classical trajectories by the quantum degrees of freedom. While the backreaction is underestimated in the common Ehrenfest model, more recent methodologies succeed in capturing this important effect by resorting to Koopman wavefunctions in classical mechanics. Luckily, both Ehrenfest and Koopman models enjoy a variational framework which is exploited here to unfold the geometric structure underlying quantum-classical coupling. A special role is played by the action of the diffeomorphic Lagrangian paths on a non-Abelian pure-gauge potential which comprises statistical correlations. After presenting the treatment in the simple case of Ehrenfest dynamics, we move on to the Koopman model and present the role of the backreaction terms therein. Finally, we compare both models in the context of pure-dephasing systems.</description>

      <title>Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Useful trick to compute correlation functions of composite operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general, in gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by gauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. As we recently demonstrated in the context of the $U\left(1\right)$ and $SU\left(2\right)$ Higgs models \cite{Dudal:2019pyg,Dudal:2020uwb,Maas:2020kda}, correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators exhibit very nice properties. Besides the well-known gauge independence, they do not present unphysical cuts, and their K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann representations are positive, at least perturbatively. Despite all these interesting features, they are not employed as much as elementary fields, mainly due to the additional complexities involved in their computation and renormalization. In this article, we present a useful trick to compute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This trick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to the composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the traditional algorithms used to compute correlation functions of elementary fields.</description>
