      <title>A Graph Based Raman Spectral Processing Technique for Exosome Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exosomes are small vesicles crucial for cell signaling and disease biomarkers. Due to their complexity, an "omics" approach is preferable to individual biomarkers. While Raman spectroscopy is effective for exosome analysis, it requires high sample concentrations and has limited sensitivity to lipids and proteins. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy helps overcome these challenges. In this study, we leverage Neo4j graph databases to organize 3,045 Raman spectra of exosomes, enhancing data generalization. To further refine spectral analysis, we introduce a novel spectral filtering process that integrates the PageRank Filter with optimal Dimensionality Reduction. This method improves feature selection, resulting in superior classification performance. Specifically, the Extra Trees model, using our spectral processing approach, achieves 0.76 and 0.857 accuracy in classifying hyperglycemic, hypoglycemic, and normal exosome samples based on Raman spectra and surface, respectively, with group 10-fold cross-validation. Our results show that graph-based spectral filtering combined with optimal dimensionality reduction significantly improves classification accuracy by reducing noise while preserving key biomarker signals. This novel framework enhances Raman-based exosome analysis, expanding its potential for biomedical applications, disease diagnostics, and biomarker discovery.</description>

      <title>Topological model selection: a case-study in tumour-induced angiogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing mathematical models offers a means to evaluate competing scientific theories. However, exact methods of model calibration are not applicable to many probabilistic models which simulate high-dimensional spatio-temporal data. Approximate Bayesian Computation is a widely-used method for parameter inference and model selection in such scenarios, and it may be combined with Topological Data Analysis to study models which simulate data with fine spatial structure. We develop a flexible pipeline for parameter inference and model selection in spatio-temporal models. Our pipeline identifies topological summary statistics which quantify spatio-temporal data and uses them to approximate parameter and model posterior distributions. We validate our pipeline on models of tumour-induced angiogenesis, inferring four parameters in three established models and identifying the correct model in synthetic test-cases.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence Reference Target Quantitative Analysis Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standardized performance evaluation of fluorescence imaging systems remains a critical unmet need in the field of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). While the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) TG311 report and recent FDA draft guidance provide recommended metrics for system characterization, practical tools for extracting these metrics remain limited, inconsistent, and often inaccessible. We present QUEL-QAL, an open-source Python library designed to streamline and standardize the quantitative analysis of fluorescence images using solid reference targets. The library provides a modular, reproducible workflow that includes region of interest (ROI) detection, statistical analysis, and visualization capabilities. QUEL-QAL supports key metrics such as response linearity, limit of detection, depth sensitivity, and spatial resolution, in alignment with regulatory and academic guidance. Built on widely adopted Python packages, the library is designed to be extensible, enabling users to adapt it to novel target designs and analysis protocols. By promoting transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory alignment, QUEL-QAL offers a foundational tool to support standardized benchmarking and accelerate the development and evaluation of fluorescence imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time raw signal genomic analysis using fully integrated memristor hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in third-generation sequencing have enabled portable and real-time genomic sequencing, but real-time data processing remains a bottleneck, hampering on-site genomic analysis due to prohibitive time and energy costs. These technologies generate a massive amount of noisy analog signals that traditionally require basecalling and digital mapping, both demanding frequent and costly data movement on von Neumann hardware. To overcome these challenges, we present a memristor-based hardware-software co-design that processes raw sequencer signals directly in analog memory, effectively combining the separated basecalling and read mapping steps. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, end-to-end memristor-based genomic analysis in a fully integrated memristor chip. By exploiting intrinsic device noise for locality-sensitive hashing and implementing parallel approximate searches in content-addressable memory, we experimentally showcase on-site applications including infectious disease detection and metagenomic classification. Our experimentally-validated analysis confirms the effectiveness of this approach on real-world tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art 97.15% F1 score in virus raw signal mapping, with 51x speed up and 477x energy saving compared to implementation on a state-of-the-art ASIC. These results demonstrate that memristor-based in-memory computing provides a viable solution for integration with portable sequencers, enabling truly real-time on-site genomic analysis for applications ranging from pathogen surveillance to microbial community profiling.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of the Synergetic Effect between Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving effective synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy is critical for optimizing tumor control and treatment outcomes. To explore the underlying mechanisms of this synergy, we have investigated a novel treatment approach known as personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiation therapy (PULSAR), which emphasizes the impact of radiation timing on treatment efficacy. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. Building on insights from small animal PULSAR studies, we developed a mathematical framework consisting of multiple ordinary differential equations to elucidate the temporal dynamics of tumor control resulting from radiation and the adaptive immune response. The model accounts for the migration and infiltration of T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. This proposed model establishes a causal and quantitative link between radiation therapy and immunotherapy, providing a valuable in-silico analysis tool for designing future PULSAR trials.</description>

      <title>Brain states analysis of EEG predicts multiple sclerosis and mirrors disease duration and burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15665v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.</description>

      <title>SCMPPI: Supervised Contrastive Multimodal Framework for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction plays a pivotal role in deciphering cellular functions and disease mechanisms. To address the limitations of traditional experimental methods and existing computational approaches in cross-modal feature fusion and false-negative suppression, we propose SCMPPI-a novel supervised contrastive multimodal framework. By effectively integrating sequence-based features (AAC, DPC, ESMC-CKSAAP) with network topology (Node2Vec embeddings) and incorporating an enhanced contrastive learning strategy with negative sample filtering, SCMPPI achieves superior prediction performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy(98.13%) and AUC(99.69%), along with excellent cross-species generalization (AUC&gt;99%). Successful applications in CD9 networks, Wnt pathway analysis, and cancer-specific networks further highlight its potential for disease target discovery, establishing SCMPPI as a powerful tool for multimodal biological data analysis.</description>

      <title>A conceptual synthesis of causal assumptions for causal discovery and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a conceptual synthesis of causal discovery and inference frameworks, with a focus on how foundational assumptions -- causal sufficiency, causal faithfulness, and the causal Markov condition -- are formalized and operationalized across methodological traditions. Through structured tables and comparative summaries, I map core assumptions, tasks, and analytical choices from multiple causal frameworks, highlighting their connections and differences. The synthesis provides practical guidance for researchers designing causal studies, especially in settings where observational or experimental constraints challenge standard approaches. This guide spans all phases of causal analysis, including question formulation, formalization of background knowledge, selection of appropriate frameworks, choice of study design or algorithm, and interpretation. It is intended as a tool to support rigorous causal reasoning across diverse empirical domains.</description>
