      <title>Economic Impacts of Climate Change in the United States: Integrating and Harmonizing Evidence from Recent Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes evidence on climate change impacts specific to U.S. populations. We develop an apples-to-apples comparison of econometric studies that empirically estimate the relationship between climate change and gross domestic product (GDP). We demonstrate that with harmonized probabilistic socioeconomic and climate inputs these papers project a narrower and lower range of 2100 GDP losses than what is reported across the published studies, yet the implied U.S.-specific social cost of greenhouse gases (SC-GHG) is still greater than the market-based damage estimates in current enumerative models. We then integrate evidence on nonmarket damages with the GDP impacts and recover a jointly-estimated SC-GHG. Our findings highlight the need for more research on both market and nonmarket climate impacts, including interaction and international spillover impacts. Further investigation of how results of macroeconomic and enumerative approaches can be integrated would enhance the usefulness of both strands of literature to climate policy analysis going forward.</description>

      <title>Exploring Trade Openness and Logistics Efficiency in the G20 Economies: A Bootstrap ARDL Analysis of Growth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between trade openness, logistics performance, and economic growth within G20 economies. Using a Bootstrap Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model augmented by a dynamic error correction mechanism (ECM), the analysis quantifies both short run and long run effects of trade facilitation and logistics infrastructure, measured via the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) from 2007 to 2023, on economic growth. The G20, as a consortium of the world's leading economies, exhibits significant variation in logistics efficiency and degrees of trade openness, providing a robust context for comparative analysis. The ARDL-ECM approach, reinforced by bootstrap resampling, delivers reliable estimates even in the presence of small samples and complex variable linkages. Findings are intended to inform policymakers seeking to enhance trade competitiveness and economic development through targeted investment in infrastructure and regulatory reforms supporting trade facilitation. The results underscore the critical role of efficient logistics specifically customs administration, physical infrastructure, and shipment reliability in driving international trade and fostering sustained economic growth. Improvements in these areas can substantially increase a country's trade capacity and overall economic performance.</description>

      <title>Worker Quality, Matching and Productivity Slowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measured aggregate productivity and the income share of top earners are strongly and positively correlated in the Canadian data. Productivity slowdown since the early 2000s was accompanied with a flattening income share of top earners. Motivated by these facts, we study the role of firms' top-paid workers and worker matching in accounting for the slowdown of measured total factor productivity. We first estimate total factor productivity for Canadian firms in the period of 2003-2015, taking into account the assortative matching between top workers and non-top workers. Measured total factor productivity consists of the Hicks-neutral technology and the quality of top workers. Our estimation suggests that measured aggregate total factor productivity declined from 2003 to 2015, in line with that estimated by the statistical agency. The decline of measured productivity is entirely accounted for by the declining quality of top workers, while the Hicks-neutral technology improved. Both the within-firm changes and the cross-firm reallocation of top-worker quality are important in contributing to the decline of overall top-worker quality. We also discuss possible causes of declines in the quality of top workers, e.g., the emigration of top talents as studied in recent literature.</description>

      <title>Information-Nonintensive Models of Rumour Impacts on Complex Investment Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a qualitative framework for analysing the impact of rumours on complex investment decisions (CID) under severe information constraints. The proposed trend-based models rely on minimal data inputs in the form of increasing, decreasing, or constant relations. Sets of trend rules generate scenarios, and permitted transitions between them form a directed graph that represents system behaviour over time. The approach is applied in three interconnected models: financial CID, rumour-spreading dynamics, and their integration.</description>

      <title>A Framework for a Comprehensive National Future Readiness Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Index of Future Readiness (IFR), a novel framework for assessing a country's capacity to withstand, adapt to, and prosper within an environment of continuous and accelerating change. The framework builds on the classical distinction, first emphasized in economic discourse by Robert E. Lucas Jr. in the 1970s, between temporary shocks, which call for economic resilience, and permanent shocks, which require adaptive capacity. The IFR applies a whole-of-society perspective, drawing on Ali Qassim Jawad s GBC model, to evaluate the preparedness of three central actors (government, businesses, and citizens) across six foundational dimensions. Unlike conventional benchmarking instruments, the IFR explicitly integrates both resilience, understood as the ability to bounce back from temporary shocks, and adaptive capacity, conceived as the ability to bounce forward in the face of structural or permanent disturbances. By enabling both sectoral and thematic analysis, the IFR provides policymakers with actionable insights and thus serves as a dynamic, policy-relevant tool for guiding national development in an era of systemic volatility.</description>

      <title>Contest vs. Competition in Cournot Duopoly: Schaffer's Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper compares two types of industrial organization in the Cournot duopoly: (a) the classical one, where the market players maximize profits and the outcome of the game is a Cournot-Nash equilibrium; (b) a contest in which players strive to win a fixed prize/bonus employing unbeatable strategies. Passing from (a) to (b) leads to a perfect competition with zero profits of the players (Schaffer's paradox). Transition from (b) to (a) results in a substantial decline in the production output, which also seems paradoxical, as it is commonly accepted that competition increases efficiency. We examine these phenomena in two versions of the Cournot model: with a homogeneous good and with differentiated goods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the coming decade, artificially intelligent agents with the ability to plan and execute complex tasks over long time horizons with little direct oversight from humans may be deployed across the economy. This chapter surveys recent developments and highlights open questions for economists around how AI agents might interact with humans and with each other, shape markets and organizations, and what institutions might be required for well-functioning markets.</description>

      <title>NoLBERT: A No Lookahead(back) Foundational Language Model for Empirical Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NoLBERT, a lightweight, timestamped foundational language model for empirical research in social sciences, particularly in economics and finance. By pre-training exclusively on 1976-1995 text, NoLBERT avoids both lookback and lookahead biases that can undermine econometric inference. It exceeds domain-specific baselines on NLP benchmarks while maintaining temporal consistency. Applied to patent texts, NoLBERT enables the construction of firm-level innovation networks and shows that gains in innovation centrality predict higher long-run profit growth.</description>

      <title>Gender Differences in Healthcare Utilisation - Evidence from Unexpected Adverse Health Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first to provide causal evidence of gender differences in healthcare utilisation to better understand the male-female health-survival paradox, where women live longer but experience worse health outcomes. Using rich Danish administrative healthcare data, we apply a staggered difference-in-differences approach that exploits the randomness in treatment timing to estimate the causal impact of adverse health shocks, such as non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, on healthcare use. Our findings suggest that men consistently use more healthcare than women, highlighting the underlying factors driving gender disparities in health outcomes. These insights contribute to the broader discourse on healthcare equity and inform policy interventions aimed at addressing these imbalances.</description>

      <title>When Do Consumers Lose from Variable Electricity Pricing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying electricity pricing better reflects the varying cost of electricity compared to flat-rate pricing. Variations between peak and off-peak costs are increasing due to weather variation, renewable intermittency, and increasing electrification of demand. Empirical and theoretical studies suggest that variable pricing can lower electricity supply costs and reduce grid stress. However, the distributional impacts, particularly on low-income consumers, remain understudied. This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze how consume heterogeneity affects welfare outcomes when electricity markets transition from flat-rate to time-varying pricing, considering realistic assumptions about heterogeneous consumer demand, supply costs, and utility losses from unmet consumption.
  We derive sufficient conditions for identifying when consumers lose utility from pricing reforms and compare welfare effects across consumer types. Our findings reveal that consumer vulnerability depends on the interaction of consumption timing, demand flexibility capabilities, and price sensitivity levels. Consumers with high peak-period consumption and inflexible demand, characteristics often associated with low-income households, are most vulnerable to welfare losses. Critically, we demonstrate that demand flexibility provides welfare protection only when coincident with large price changes. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that aggregate flexibility patterns generate spillover effects through pricing mechanisms, with peak periods experiencing greater price changes when they have less aggregate flexibility, potentially concentrating larger price increases among vulnerable populations that have a limited ability to respond. These findings suggest that variable pricing policies should be accompanied by targeted policies ensuring equitable access to demand response capabilities and pricing benefits.</description>

      <title>Location Matters: Insights from a Natural Field Experiment to Enhance Small Business Tax Compliance in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tax compliance among small businesses remains low in developing countries, yet little is known about how regional context shapes the effectiveness of enforcement strategies. Both theory and evidence suggest an ambiguous relationship between compliance and geographic proximity to tax offices. We study this issue using a large-scale natural field experiment with Indonesia's tax authority involving 12,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Businesses were randomly assigned to receive deterrence, information, or public goods letters, or no message. All letters improved compliance, with deterrence messages producing the largest gains - substantially increasing filing rates and raising monthly tax payments. Each dollar spent on deterrence letters generated about US$30 in additional revenue over the course of a year. We observe high compliance among non-treated MSMEs near metropolitan tax offices and find that enforcement messages successfully raise compliance in non-metropolitan regions to comparable levels. However, targeting already compliant MSMEs near metropolitan tax offices backfires, underscoring the need for geographically tailored tax administration strategies. These results provide novel experimental evidence on the relation between geographic proximity and the effectiveness of tax enforcement, helping to reconcile mixed findings in the tax compliance literature.</description>

      <title>Optimized Renewable Energy Planning MDP for Socially-Equitable Electricity Coverage in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages. This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S. cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions. Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Comparative Techno-economic Assessment of Wind-Powered Green Hydrogen Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amid global interest in resilient energy systems, green hydrogen is considered vital to the net-zero transition, yet its deployment remains limited by high production cost. The cost is determined by the its production pathway, system configuration, asset location, and interplay with electricity markets and regulatory frameworks. To compare different deployment strategies in the UK, we develop a comprehensive techno-economic framework based on the Levelised Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) assessment. We apply this framework to 5 configurations of wind-electrolyser systems, identify the most cost-effective business cases, and conduct a sensitivity analysis of key economic parameters. Our results reveal that electricity cost is the dominant contributor to LCOH, followed by the electrolyser cost. Our work highlights the crucial role that location, market arrangements and control strategies among RES and hydrogen investors play in the economic feasibility of deploying green hydrogen systems. Policies that subsidise low-cost electricity access and optimise deployment can lower LCOH, enhancing the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Mechanism Design for Electric Vehicle Charging with Day-Ahead Reservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can reserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the real-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for running the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as incentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance. Specifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two markets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the real-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the proposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the other is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies some combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price mechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing mechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no efficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve efficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides the reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two markets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly efficient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Self-respecting worker in the precarious gig economy: A dynamic principal-agent model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.10021v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a continuous-time principal-agent model of gig work, where contractual flexibility allows the employer to adjust fixed pay and output-based incentives dynamically. The worker's participation depends on a backward-looking reference value--an exponentially weighted average of net payoff from past employment--capturing a self-respect--driven wage demand. If an offer's expected utility falls short of the reference value, the worker rejects the contract, resulting in temporary unemployment. Accepted contracts transmit output volatility to the worker through a sensitivity parameter, inducing instability into earnings and employment. The employer's optimal threshold policies strategically use this volatility transfer to regulate the worker's wage demands. In the first-best case, the principal imposes maximal volatility to drive the reference value down to its minimum, after which volatility transfer ceases entirely. In the second-best case, the need to incentivize effort ensures ongoing volatility transfer. Stationary analysis predicts a humped-shaped relationship between worker sensitivity and the principal's profit. If sensitivity is too low, the worker's wage demands are overly rigid and difficult to regulate, while if it is too high, their demands become excessively volatile, which eventually erodes the principal's control.</description>

      <title>Marrying Up or Matching Even? Socioeconomic Drivers of Spousal Age Gaps in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the determinants of the spousal age gap (SAG) in India, utilizing data from the 61st and 68th rounds of the National Sample Survey (NSSO). We employ regression analysis, including instrumental variables, to address selection bias and account for unobservable factors. We hypothesize an inverted U-shaped relationship between educational assortative mating and SAG, where, keeping the husband's education constant at the graduation level, the SAG first widens and then narrows as the wife's education level increases from primary to postgraduate. This pattern is shaped by distinct socio-economic factors across rural and urban settings. In rural India, increasing prosperity, changes in family structure, and educational hypergamy contribute to a wider age gap, with the influence of bride squeeze further exacerbating this disparity. Conversely, in urban areas, while the growth of white-collar jobs initially contributed to a narrowing of the SAG in 2004-05, this trend did not persist by 2011-12. Specifically, the influence of income on SAG becomes nonlinear, showing declining trends beyond the 7th income quantile, reflecting limited marriage mobility opportunities for females and hinting at a possible threat to the institution of marriage among the urban upper class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide empirical evidence on how specific social, economic, and cultural dynamics influence the spousal age gap in Indian society. This increasing and persistent spousal age gap has significant implications for the treatment of women, power dynamics, and violence within marriage.</description>

      <title>User Location Disclosure Fails to Deter Overseas Criticism but Amplifies Regional Divisions on Chinese Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the behavioral impact of a user location disclosure policy on Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging platform, using a unique high-frequency dataset of uncensored engagement, including tens of thousands of comments and replies, on prominent government and media accounts. The policy, publicly justified as a measure to curb misinformation and counter foreign influence, was abruptly rolled out on April 28, 2022. Using an interrupted time series design, we find no decline in participation by overseas users. Instead, it significantly reduced domestic engagement with local issues outside users' home provinces, particularly among critical comments. Evidence indicates this decline was not driven by generalized fear or concerns about credibility, but by a surge in regionally discriminatory replies that raised the social cost of cross-provincial engagement. Our findings suggest that identity disclosure tools can have unintended consequences by activating existing social divisions in ways that reinforce state control without direct censorship.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust Optimization for European Electricity System Planning Considering Regional Dunkelflaute Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides insights on how to plan a weather robust energy system consisting of several interconnected regions. We develop a capacity expansion model for a fully decarbonized European electricity system using an adaptive robust optimization framework. The model endogenously identifies the worst regional Dunkelflaute events, prolonged periods of low wind and solar availability, and incorporates multiple extreme weather realizations within a single optimization run. Results show that system costs rise nonlinearly with the geographic extent of these events: a single worst-case regional disruption increases costs by 9%, but broader disruptions across multiple regions lead to much sharper increases, up to 51%. As Dunkelflaute conditions extend across most of Europe, additional cost impacts level off, with a maximum increase of 71%. The optimal technology mix evolves with the severity of weather stress: while renewables, batteries, and interregional transmission are sufficient to manage localized events, large-scale disruptions require long-term hydrogen storage and load shedding to maintain system resilience. Central European regions, especially Germany and France, emerge as systemic bottlenecks, while peripheral regions bear the cost of compensatory overbuilding. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated European policy strategy that goes beyond national planning to support cross-border infrastructure investment, scale up flexible technologies such as long-duration storage, and promote a geographically balanced deployment of renewables to mitigate systemic risks associated with Dunkelflaute events.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Unmeasurable? Systematic Evidence on Scale Transformations in Subjective Survey Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordered response scales are ubiquitous in economics, but their interpretation rests on an untested assumption: that numerical labels reflect equal psychological intervals. The contribution of this paper is to provide a systematic assessment of this linearity assumption, developing a general framework to quantify how easily empirical results can be overturned when it is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that respondents use survey scales in ways that deviate from linearity, but only mildly so. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 40,000+ coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics journals. Coefficient signs are remarkably robust to the mild departures from linear scale-use we document experimentally. However, estimates of relative effect sizes, which are crucial for policy applications, are unreliable even under these modest non-linearities.</description>

      <title>Do the rich pay their fair share? Enumerating the financial and emissions consequences of abolishing premium air travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Premium air travel is often associated with a disproportionately large carbon emissions footprint. This association reflects the increased space and amenities typically found in premium cabins that existing discourse suggests makes their carriage more fuel, and consequently carbon, intensive. One increasingly popular solution is disincentivizing the use of premium cabins in favor of all-economy cabins. How effective might such a policy be. To what extent. And how may the revenue impact affect travelers. We address these questions by leveraging an empirical model that integrates cabin configuration data, fuel burn profiles across various aircraft types, and multi-month airfare datasets. Our findings are threefold. First, we find that favoring entirely foregoing premium travel classes can reduce per-passenger emissions by between 8.1 and 21.5 percent, the precise figure varying based on the type of aircraft and aircraft stage length involved. Second, we observe that these emissions reductions are far less assured on a per-flight and a lifespan basis. Here, an all-economy configuration can reduce emissions by 0.45 percent or increase emissions by as much as 1.43 percent. Third, we enumerate pronounced revenue consequences associated with an all-economy configuration. This configuration produces aggregate revenue declines of between 4.92 and 23.1 percent, necessitating airfare increases of between 6 and 30 percent to maintain baseline revenue. This increase risks imposing a profound and regressive economic burden on working-class travelers who exhibit markedly higher price elasticities of demand compared to their wealthier counterparts and highlights the cross-subsidization airlines leverage to ensure the accessibility of air travel.</description>

      <title>Normalizations and misspecification in skill formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00473v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important class of structural models studies the determinants of skill formation and the optimal timing of interventions. In this paper, I provide new identification results for these models and investigate the effects of seemingly innocuous scale and location restrictions on parameters of interest. To do so, I first characterize the identified set of all parameters without these additional restrictions and show that important policy-relevant parameters are point identified under weaker assumptions than commonly used in the literature. The implications of imposing standard scale and location restrictions depend on how the model is specified, but they generally impact the interpretation of parameters and may affect counterfactuals. Importantly, with the popular CES production function, commonly used scale restrictions fix identified parameters and lead to misspecification. Consequently, simply changing the units of measurements of observed variables might yield ineffective investment strategies and misleading policy recommendations. I show how existing estimators can easily be adapted to solve these issues. As a byproduct, this paper also presents a general and formal definition of when restrictions are truly normalizations.</description>

      <title>Privacy vs. Profit: The Impact of Google's Manifest Version 3 (MV3) Update on Ad Blocker Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Google's recent update to the manifest file for Chrome browser extensions, transitioning from manifest version 2 (MV2) to manifest version 3 (MV3), has raised concerns among users and ad blocker providers, who worry that the new restrictions, notably the shift from the powerful WebRequest API to the more restrictive DeclarativeNetRequest API, might reduce ad blocker effectiveness. Because ad blockers play a vital role for millions of users seeking a more private and ad-free browsing experience, this study empirically investigates how the MV3 update affects their ability to block ads and trackers. Through a browser-based experiment conducted across multiple samples of ad-supported websites, we compare the MV3 to MV2 instances of four widely used ad blockers. Our results reveal no statistically significant reduction in ad-blocking or anti-tracking effectiveness for MV3 ad blockers compared to their MV2 counterparts, and in some cases, MV3 instances even exhibit slight improvements in blocking trackers. These findings are reassuring for users, indicating that the MV3 instances of popular ad blockers continue to provide effective protection against intrusive ads and privacy-infringing trackers. While some uncertainties remain, ad blocker providers appear to have successfully navigated the MV3 update, finding solutions that maintain the core functionality of their extensions.</description>
