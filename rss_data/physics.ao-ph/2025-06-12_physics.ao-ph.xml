      <title>Machine learning-based correlation analysis of decadal cyclone intensity with sea surface temperature: data and tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09254v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising number of extreme climate events in the past decades has motivated the need for a thorough consideration of tropical cyclone genesis and intensity, given the sea-surface temperature (SST). In this paper, we present an analysis of the relationship between the increasing global SST with cyclone genesis using linear regression machine learning models. We extract and curate a dataset of tropical cyclones across selected ocean basins with their associated SST over the past 40 years. We provide correlation analysis using linear regression and visualisation strategies. Our preliminary results show a strong positive correlation between SST and high wind speed across selected ocean basins via linear regression and machine learning models. Our dataset and available open-source code offer a novel perspective for the investigation of the genesis and intensity of tropical cyclones. Alongside the time and position of each cyclone, we also provide the related Saffir-Simpson category, season, wind speed, and SST for 15 days before and after the tropical cyclone genesis.</description>

      <title>AtmosMJ: Revisiting Gating Mechanism for AI Weather Forecasting Beyond the Year Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.</description>

      <title>Causal Climate Emulation with Bayesian Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning. We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed climate models.</description>

      <title>Leveraging data-driven weather models for improving numerical weather prediction skill through large-scale spectral nudging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operational meteorological forecasting has long relied on physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Recently, this landscape has faced disruption by the advent of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather models, which offer tremendous computational performance and competitive forecasting accuracy. However, data-driven models for medium-range forecasting generally suffer from major limitations, including low effective resolution and a narrow range of predicted variables. This study illustrates the relative strengths and weaknesses of these competing paradigms using the physics-based GEM (Global Environmental Multiscale) and the AI-based GraphCast models. Analyses of their respective global predictions in physical and spectral space reveal that GraphCast-predicted large scales outperform GEM, particularly for longer lead times, even though fine scales predicted by GraphCast suffer from excessive smoothing. Building on this insight, a hybrid NWP-AI system is proposed, wherein temperature and horizontal wind components predicted by GEM are spectrally nudged toward GraphCast predictions at large scales, while GEM itself freely generates the fine-scale details critical for local predictability and weather extremes. This hybrid approach is capable of leveraging the strengths of GraphCast to enhance the prediction skill of the GEM model while generating a full suite of physically consistent forecast fields with a full power spectrum. Additionally, trajectories of tropical cyclones are predicted with enhanced accuracy without significant changes in intensity. Work is in progress for operationalization of this hybrid system at the Canadian Meteorological Centre.</description>

      <title>Mapping global offshore wind wake losses, layout optimisation potential, and climate change effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study assesses global offshore wind energy resources, wake-induced losses, array layout optimisation potential and climate change impacts. Global offshore ambient potential is first mapped based on reanalysis data. Wake-induced losses are then estimated using an engineering wake model, revealing that locations with low (high) resource typically experience larger (smaller) percentage losses. However, the specific wind speed distribution is found to be important, with narrower distributions generally leading to greater losses. This is due to the overlap between the wind speed distribution and the high-sensitivity region of the turbine thrust and power curves. Broadly, this leads to much stronger wake-induced losses in the tropics (which experience the trade winds) than mid-latitudes. However, the tropics also experience a narrower wind direction distribution; the results of this study demonstrate that this leads to greater potential for mitigation of wake effects via layout optimisation. Finally, projected changes in wind potential and wake losses due to climate change under a high-emission scenario are assessed. Many regions are projected to decrease in ambient wind resources, and furthermore these regions will typically experience greater wake-induced losses, exacerbating the climate change impact. These results highlight the different challenges and opportunities associated with exploiting offshore wind resources across the globe.</description>

      <title>Ensemble reliability and the signal-to-noise paradox in large-ensemble subseasonal forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have illustrated the existence of a `signal-to-noise paradox' (SNP) in some ensemble forecasting systems that manifests as situations where the correlation between the forecast ensemble mean and the observed truth is larger than the correlation between the forecast ensemble mean and individual forecast members. A well-calibrated forecast system that simultaneously satisfies climatological and ensemble variance reliability criteria will not exhibit an SNP if sample statistics can be evaluated using a sufficiently large ensemble size ($N$) over a sufficiently large number of independent cases ($M$). However, when $M$ is finite, an apparent SNP will sometimes occur as a natural consequence of sampling uncertainty, even in a perfectly reliable ensemble with many members. In this study, we evaluate the forecast skill, reliability characteristics, and signal-to-noise properties of three large-scale atmospheric circulation indices in 100-member subseasonal reforecasts with the ECMWF IFS. Daily mean NAO forecasts generally satisfy unbiased reliability criteria within the tolerance of our estimated sampling uncertainties. Nevertheless, NAO forecasts in this dataset exhibit symptoms of the SNP at subseasonal lead times. However, we do not find robust evidence for an underestimation of the magnitude of predictable signals and do not exclude the possibility that the apparent paradox in this dataset is a consequence of observational sampling uncertainties that are insensitive to ensemble size and common to all comparisons for this set of forecast start dates and lead times. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this apparent SNP can be eliminated with an unbiased reliability calibration. However, this is achieved through overfitting such that calibrated forecasts inherit the large sampling uncertainties present in the observations and thus exhibit unphysical variations with lead time.</description>

Abstract: We present an explicit and exact solution to the governing equations describing the vertical structure of the Arctic Ocean region centered around the North Pole. The solution describes a stratified water column with three constant-density regions: a motionless bottom layer, a middle layer - the halocline - described by nonhydrostatic, near-inertial Pollard waves, and an upper layer presenting a mean current and a wave motion associated with the one in the halocline layer.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of decaying turbulence beneath surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores decaying turbulence beneath surface waves that is initially isotropic and shear-free. We start by presenting phenomenology revealed by wave-averaged numerical simulations: an accumulation of angular momentum in coherent vortices perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, suppression of kinetic energy dissipation, and the development of depth-alternating jets. We interpret these features through an analogy with rotating turbulence (Holm 1996), wherein the curl of the Stokes drift, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^S$, takes on the role of the background vorticity (for example, $(f_0 + \beta y) \hat{\boldsymbol{z}}$ on the beta plane). We pursue this thread further by showing that a two-equation model proposed by Bardina et al. (1985) for rotating turbulence reproduces the simulated evolution of volume-integrated kinetic energy. This success of the two-equation model -- which explicitly parametrizes wave-driven suppression of kinetic energy dissipation -- carries implications for modeling turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer. We conclude with a discussion about a wave-averaged analogue of the Rossby number appearing in the two-equation model, which we term the "pseudovorticity number" after the pseudovorticity $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^S$. The pseudovorticity number is related to the Langmuir number in an integral sense.</description>
