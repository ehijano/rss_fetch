      <title>One is all you need: Second-order Unification without First-order Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fragment of Second-Order unification with the following properties: (i) only one second-order variable allowed, (ii) first-order variables do not occur. We show that Hilbert's 10$^{th}$ problem is reducible to this fragment if the signature contains a binary function symbol and two constants. This generalizes known undecidability results. Furthermore, We show that adding the following restriction: (i) the second-order variable has arity 1, (ii) the signature is finite, and (iii) the problem has \emph{bounded congruence}, results in a decidable fragment. The latter fragment is related to \emph{Bounded second-order unification}, i.e. the number of holes is a function of the problem structure.</description>

      <title>On Homomorphism Indistinguishability and Hypertree Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $GC^k$ is a logic introduced by Scheidt and Schweikardt (2023) to express properties of hypergraphs. It is similar to first-order logic with counting quantifiers ($C$) adapted to the hypergraph setting. It has distinct sets of variables for vertices and for hyperedges and requires vertex variables to be guarded by hyperedge variables on every quantification.
  We prove that two hypergraphs $G$, $H$ satisfy the same sentences in the logic $GC^k$ with guard depth at most $k$ if, and only if, they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of hypergraphs of strict hypertree depth at most $k$. This lifts the analogous result for tree depth $\leq k$ and sentences of first-order logic with counting quantifiers of quantifier rank at most $k$ due to Grohe (2020) from graphs to hypergraphs. The guard depth of a formula is the quantifier rank with respect to hyperedge variables, and strict hypertree depth is a restriction of hypertree depth as defined by Adler, Gaven\v{c}iak and Klimo\v{s}ov\'a (2012). To justify this restriction, we show that for every $H$, the strict hypertree depth of $H$ is at most 1 larger than its hypertree depth, and we give additional evidence that strict hypertree depth can be viewed as a reasonable generalisation of tree depth for hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>The General and Finite Satisfiability Problems for PCTL are Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general/finite PCTL satisfiability problem asks whether a given PCTL formula has a general/finite model. We show that the finite PCTL satisfiability problem is undecidable, and the general PCTL satisfiability problem is even highly undecidable (beyond the arithmetical hierarchy). Consequently, there are no sound deductive systems proving all generally/finitely valid PCTL formulae.</description>

      <title>Learning Symbolic Task Representation from a Human-Led Demonstration: A Memory to Store, Retrieve, Consolidate, and Forget Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symbolic learning framework inspired by cognitive-like memory functionalities (i.e., storing, retrieving, consolidating and forgetting) to generate task representations to support high-level task planning and knowledge bootstrapping. We address a scenario involving a non-expert human, who performs a single task demonstration, and a robot, which online learns structured knowledge to re-execute the task based on experiences, i.e., observations. We consider a one-shot learning process based on non-annotated data to store an intelligible representation of the task, which can be refined through interaction, e.g., via verbal or visual communication. Our general-purpose framework relies on fuzzy Description Logic, which has been used to extend the previously developed Scene Identification and Tagging algorithm. In this paper, we exploit such an algorithm to implement cognitive-like memory functionalities employing scores that rank memorised observations over time based on simple heuristics. Our main contribution is the formalisation of a framework that can be used to systematically investigate different heuristics for bootstrapping hierarchical knowledge representations based on robot observations. Through an illustrative assembly task scenario, the paper presents the performance of our framework to discuss its benefits and limitations.</description>

      <title>A Session Type System for Asynchronous Unreliable Broadcast Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.01353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Session types are formal specifications of communication protocols, allowing protocol implementations to be verified by typechecking. Up to now, session type disciplines have assumed that the communication medium is reliable, with no loss of messages. However, unreliable broadcast communication is common in a wide class of distributed systems such as ad-hoc and wireless sensor networks. Often such systems have structured communication patterns that should be amenable to analysis by means of session types, but the necessary theory has not previously been developed. We introduce the Unreliable Broadcast Session Calculus, a process calculus with unreliable broadcast communication, and equip it with a session type system that we show is sound. We capture two common operations, broadcast and gather, inhabiting dual session types. Message loss may lead to non-synchronised session endpoints. To further account for unreliability we provide with an autonomous recovery mechanism that does not require acknowledgements from session participants. Our type system ensures soundness, safety, and progress between the synchronised endpoints within a session. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our framework by implementing Paxos, the textbook protocol for reaching consensus in an unreliable, asynchronous network.</description>

      <title>Preservation Theorems Through the Lens of Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of topological spaces that captures the existence of preservation theorems. The structure of those spaces allows us to study the relativisation of preservation theorems under suitable definitions of surjective morphisms, subclasses, sums, products, topological closures, and projective limits. Throughout the paper, we also integrate already known results into this new framework and show how it captures th essence of their proofs.</description>

      <title>SAT-based Learning of Computation Tree Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CTL learning problem consists in finding for a given sample of positive and negative Kripke structures a distinguishing CTL formula that is verified by the former but not by the latter. Further constraints may bound the size and shape of the desired formula or even ask for its minimality in terms of syntactic size. This synthesis problem is motivated by explanation generation for dissimilar models, e.g. comparing a faulty implementation with the original protocol. We devise a SAT-based encoding for a fixed size CTL formula, then provide an incremental approach that guarantees minimality. We further report on a prototype implementation whose contribution is twofold: first, it allows us to assess the efficiency of various output fragments and optimizations. Secondly, we can experimentally evaluate this tool by randomly mutating Kripke structures or syntactically introducing errors in higher-level models, then learning CTL distinguishing formulas.</description>

      <title>Equivariant ideals of polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study existence and computability of finite bases for ideals of polynomials over infinitely many variables. In our setting, variables come from a countable logical structure A, and embeddings from A to A act on polynomials by renaming variables. First, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for A to guarantee the following generalisation of Hilbert's Basis Theorem: every polynomial ideal which is equivariant, i.e. invariant under renaming of variables, is finitely generated. Second, we develop an extension of classical Buchberger's algorithm to compute a Gr\"obner basis of a given equivariant ideal. This implies decidability of the membership problem for equivariant ideals. Finally, we sketch upon various applications of these results to register automata, Petri nets with data, orbit-finitely generated vector spaces, and orbit-finite systems of linear equations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unification of Logic and Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a theory of communication that covers the following generic scenario: Alice knows more than Bob about a certain set of logic propositions and Alice and Bob wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic proposition that Alice knows to be true.
  We assume that our logic system is propositional logic, and we build on top of one of the legendary works in this area, namely the work of Carnap and Bar-Hillel on a theory of semantic information. Our main contribution is a collection of theorems studying various different assumptions on what Alice and Bob know and what their goal is. These theorems all provide sharp upper and lower bounds phrased in terms of an entropy-like function that we call $\Lambda$, in reference to its apparent connection to problems of communication involving logic. It turns out that when the goal is to communicate only a portion of the knowledge that Alice possesses, the optimum communication cost is lower than most people seem to assume, yet unavoidably, such optimum communication strategies end up allowing Bob to prove even more things than originally intended. Another interesting outcome is that in some scenarios, Alice need not know the logic statements that Bob knows in order to attain asymptotically the same communication efficiency as if she knew the statement, in a nod to the famous Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv results from source coding theory. Our work also introduces practical codes, which are comprised of a combination of linear codes and enumerative source codes, which turn out to be asymptotically optimal for some scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fossil 2.0: Formal Certificate Synthesis for the Verification and Control of Dynamical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Fossil 2.0, a new major release of a software tool for the synthesis of certificates (e.g., Lyapunov and barrier functions) for dynamical systems modelled as ordinary differential and difference equations. Fossil 2.0 is much improved from its original release, including new interfaces, a significantly expanded certificate portfolio, controller synthesis and enhanced extensibility. We present these new features as part of this tool paper. Fossil implements a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) loop ensuring the soundness of the method. Our tool uses neural networks as templates to generate candidate functions, which are then formally proven by an SMT solver acting as an assertion verifier. Improvements with respect to the first release include a wider range of certificates, synthesis of control laws, and support for discrete-time models.</description>

      <title>Tensorial structure of the lifting doctrine in constructive domain theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a survey of the two-dimensional and tensorial structure of the lifting doctrine in constructive domain theory, i.e. in the theory of directed-complete partial orders (dcpos) over an arbitrary elementary topos. We establish the universal property of lifting of dcpos as the Sierpi\'nski cone, from which we deduce (1) that lifting forms a Kock-Z\"oberlein doctrine, (2) that lifting algebras, pointed dcpos, and inductive partial orders form canonically equivalent locally posetal 2-categories, and (3) that the category of lifting algebras is cocomplete, with connected colimits created by the forgetful functor to dcpos. Finally we deduce the symmetric monoidal closure of the Eilenberg-Moore resolution of the lifting 2-monad by means of smash products; these are shown to classify both bilinear maps and strict maps, which we prove to coincide in the constructive setting. We provide several concrete computations of the smash product as dcpo coequalisers and lifting algebra coequalisers, and compare these with the more abstract results of Seal. Although all these results are well-known classically, the existing proofs do not apply in a constructive setting; indeed, the classical analysis of the Eilenberg-Moore category of the lifting monad relies on the fact that all lifting algebras are free, a condition that is not known to hold constructively.</description>

      <title>Representing Pedagogic Content Knowledge Through Rough Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A teacher's knowledge base consists of knowledge of mathematics content, knowledge of student epistemology, and pedagogical knowledge. It has severe implications on the understanding of student's knowledge of content, and the learning context in general. The necessity to formalize the different content knowledge in approximate senses is recognized in the education research literature. A related problem is that of coherent formalizability. Existing responsive or smart AI-based software systems do not concern themselves with meaning, and trained ones are replete with their own issues. In the present research, many issues in modeling teachers' understanding of content are identified, and a two-tier rough set-based model is proposed by the present author for the purpose of developing software that can aid the varied tasks of a teacher. The main advantage of the proposed approach is in its ability to coherently handle vagueness, granularity and multi-modality. An extended example to equational reasoning is used to demonstrate these. The paper is meant for rough set researchers intending to build logical models or develop meaning-aware AI-software to aid teachers, and education research experts.</description>
