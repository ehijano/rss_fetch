      <title>Thermal one-loop self-energy correction for hydrogen-like systems: relativistic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a fully relativistic framework, the one-loop self-energy correction for a bound electron is derived and extended to incorporate the effects of external thermal radiation. In a series of previous works, it was shown that in quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature (QED), the description of effects caused by blackbody radiation can be reduced to using the thermal part of the photon propagator. As a consequence of the non-relativistic approximation in the calculation of the thermal one-loop self-energy correction, well-known quantum-mechanical (QM) phenomena emerge at successive orders: the Stark effect arises at leading order in $\alpha Z$, the Zeeman effect appears in the next-to-leading non-relativistic correction, accompanied by diamagnetic contributions and their relativistic refinements, among other perturbative corrections. The fully relativistic approach used in this work for calculating the SE contribution allows for accurate calculations of the thermal shift of atomic levels, in which all these effects are automatically taken into account. The hydrogen atom serves as the basis for testing a fully relativistic approach to such calculations. Additionally, an analysis is presented of the behavior of the thermal shift caused by the thermal one-loop correction to the self-energy of a bound electron for hydrogen-like ions with an arbitrary nuclear charge $Z$. The significance of these calculations lies in their relevance to contemporary high-precision experiments, where thermal radiation constitutes one of the major contributions to the overall uncertainty budget.</description>

      <title>Bound and Resonant States of Muonic Few-Body Coulomb Systems: Extended Stochastic Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the bound and resonant states of hydrogen-like muonic ions ($\mu\mu p$, $\mu\mu d$, $\mu\mu t$) and three-body muonic molecular ions ($pp\mu$, $pd\mu$, $pt\mu$, $dd\mu$, $dt\mu$, $tt\mu$), and the four-body double-muonic hydrogen molecule ($\mu\mu pp$) using an extended stochastic variational method combined with complex scaling. The approach provides a unified treatment of bound and quasibound states and achieves an energy accuracy better than $0.1~\mathrm{eV}$ across all systems studied. Complete spectra below the corresponding $n=2$ atomic thresholds are obtained, including several previously unresolved shallow resonances in both three- and four-body sectors.</description>

      <title>Optical clocks with accuracy validated at the 19th digit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive evaluation of all known sources of systematic uncertainty for two independent $^{176}$Lu$^+$ single-ion optical references, finding total systematic uncertainty of $1.1\times10^{-19}$ and $1.4\times10^{-19}$ for the two individual systems and $9.6\times10^{-20}$ for the difference. Through direct comparison via correlation spectroscopy, we demonstrate a relative frequency agreement of $-2.4\pm(5.7)_\mathrm{stat}\pm(1.0)_\mathrm{sys}\times10^{-19}$, where `stat' and `sys' indicate the statistical and systematic uncertainty, respectively. The comparison uncertainty is statistically limited after approximately 200 hours of averaging with a measurement instability of $4.8\times10^{-16}(\tau/\mathrm{s})^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Determination of nuclear quadrupole moments of $^{25}$Mg, $^{87}$Sr, and $^{135,137}$Ba via configuration-interaction plus coupled-cluster approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the configuration-interaction plus coupled-cluster approach, we calculate the electric-field gradients $q$ for the low-lying states of alkaline-earth atoms, including magnesium (Mg), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba). These low-lying states specifically include the $3s3p~^3\!P_{1,2}$ states of Mg; the $5s4d~^1\!D_{2}$ and $5s5p~^3\!P_{1,2}$ states of Sr; as well as the $6s5d~^3\!D_{1,2,3}$, $6s5d~^1\!D_{2}$, and $6s6p~^1\!P_{1}$ states of Ba. By combining the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine-structure constants of these states, we accurately determine the nuclear quadrupole moments of $^{25}$Mg, $^{87}$Sr, and $^{135,137}$Ba. These results are compared with the available data. The comparison shows that our nuclear quadrupole moment of $^{25}$Mg is in perfect agreement with the result from the mesonic X-ray experiment. However, there are approximately 10\% and 4\% differences between our results and the currently adopted values [Pyykk$\rm \ddot{o}$, Mol. Phys. 116, 1328(2018)] for the nuclear quadrupole moments of $^{87}$Sr and $^{135,137}$Ba respectively. Moreover, we also calculate the magnetic dipole hyperfine-structure constants of these states, and the calculated results exhibit good agreement with the measured data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid qubit-oscillator module with motional states of two trapped interacting atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of motional states of two interacting atoms trapped in a potential stroboscopically engineered by an optical tweezer as a means to implement a qubit-oscillator system, in analogy to those implemented in circuit quantum electrodynamics and trapped ions. In our setting, the center of mass degree of freedom of the atoms plays the role of a photon or phonon mode, while the interacting, relative mode acts as a qubit. No internal state is involved in our system, which makes this motional qubit robust to spin-dependent noise. We show that a universal set of bosonic operations, including displacement, rotation, squeezing, and the corresponding set of gates controlled by the qubit, can be implemented through precise temporal modulation of the optical tweezers. We numerically check that these gates can be generated with high fidelity, and discuss possible schemes for initial state preparation and final state readout. While we restrict the discussion to a single qubit-oscillator module, scalability can be achieved by coupling arrays of atoms via dipolar or Rydberg-dressed interactions.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation driven by temporal-mode quantum states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for high-harmonic generation (HHG) driven by quantum states of light based on a temporal-mode expansion of the electromagnetic field. This approach extends previous single plane-wave mode treatments to realistic pulse configurations, resolving conceptual inconsistencies arising from non-normalizable infinite plane waves and establishing consistency between analytical and numerical methods. We derive a correction factor that quantifies deviations from the single-mode approximation and show that it remains below $10^{-4}$ for intensities typical of HHG ($\sim 10^{14}~$W/cm$^2$). This result confirms that free-space HHG driven by any quantum state of light is accurately described by averaging semi-classical calculations over the Husimi distribution, with no observable genuine quantum effects. The absence of such effects is attributed to the large photon numbers ($\sim 10^{11}$) required to reach HHG intensities in free space, which render quantum fluctuations negligible. We discuss nanophotonic environments with ultrasmall mode volumes as potential platforms where few-photon strong-field processes could exhibit genuine quantum signatures.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative low harmonics generation in low-frequency laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving numerically three-dimensional non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation, we find the atomic response to the quasi-static electric field We suggest a semi-phenomenological approximation of this response which describes well the {\it ab initio} numerical calculation result both for low and high intensities (up to $1.4 \cdot 10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$). In particular, this approximation describes the nonperturbative increase or the third harmonic generation efficiency with the laser intensity, as well as the dependence of the optical ratification signal in the two-color field on the phase difference between the fields. Making the calculations for the realistic laser frequencies, we find that our approach is applicable up to fundamental frequencies of about 1 eV.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-assisted Observation of the Lowest Vibrational Level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ State of Ultracold LiK Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The narrow transition from the lowest rovibrational level of the $\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic ground state to the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ potential provides opportunities for achieving magic-wavelength trapping of ultracold bialkali molecules for enhancing their rotational coherence times. Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\mathrm{Li}^{40}\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0&gt;$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1&gt;$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0&gt;$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0&gt;$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0&gt;$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ Decay Rate in Strontium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the decay process $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_2$ in a magneto-optical trap of Sr atoms operating on the $461\,\mathrm{nm}$ ($5s^2\,{}^1S_0 - 5s5p\,{}^1P_1$) transition by irradiating the trapped atoms with laser light resonant with the $448\,\mathrm{nm}$ ($5s4d\,{}^1D_2 - 5s8p\,{}^1P_1$) transition and observing the transient response of atom fluorescence. We measure, for the first time, the branching ratio of the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_2$ transition to be $0.177(4)$, which significantly deviates from the widely cited theoretical value of $0.322$ [C. W. Bauschlicher Jr. et al., J. Phys. B 18, 1523 (1985)]. Moreover, we determine the decay rate of the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ transition to be $5.3(5)\times10^3\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, consistent within uncertainty with the widely cited experimental value [L. R. Hunter et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 56, 823 (1986)], but substantially lower than the recent theoretical value of $9.25(40)\times10^3\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ [A. Cooper et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 041055 (2018)]. These findings have significant implications for laser cooling of Sr and fluorescence detection of single atoms in optical tweezers. They also call for a reevaluation of the previous theoretical frameworks used to calculate the decay rates of the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ and $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_{1,2}$ transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum free fall and the consistency with the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unification of quantum theory and the general theory of relativity - describing gravity, is one of the most important challenges in science. Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence, and has been confirmed to great accuracy for large bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase, equal to the quantum phase of a free-falling object. To measure this phase, we realize a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave-packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. The observed relative-phase of the wave-packets confirms the predicted phase of a free-falling object, and shows that in our low energy regime, the equivalence principle may be applied to the quantum domain. Our observation constitutes a fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Microwave-field quantum metrology with inherent robustness against detection losses enabled by Rydberg interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieving a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here, we combine the capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and be used for quantum information processing, thereby largely overcoming the issue of detection losses. While utilising the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $\SI{39}{\nV\per\cm \hertz\tothe{-1/2}}$ sensitivity, we employ inter-atomic dipolar interactions to take advantage of an error-prevention protocol that protects information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the protocol's idea is based on introducing an additional non-linear, lossy quantum channel, which results in a 3.3-fold enhancement of Fisher information. The presented results pave the way for broader adoption of quantum-information-inspired enhancements enabled by intrinsic interactions present in a sensor system, and more broadly in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</description>
