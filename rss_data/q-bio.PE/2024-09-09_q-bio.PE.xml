      <title>The Stochastic Gause predator-prey model: noise-induced extinctions and invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a stochastic Gause predator-prey model with bounded or sub-linear functional response. The model, described by a system of stochastic differential equations, captures the influence of stochastic fluctuations on predator-prey dynamics, with particular focus on the stability, extinction, and persistence of populations. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and boundedness of solutions, analyze noise-induced extinction events, and investigate the existence of unique stationary distributions for the case of Holing Type I functional response. Our analysis highlights the critical role of noise in determining long-term ecological outcomes, demonstrating that even in cases where deterministic models predict stable coexistence, stochastic noise can drive populations to extinction or alter the system's dynamics significantly.</description>

      <title>Improving Tree Probability Estimation with Stochastic Optimization and Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probability estimation of tree topologies is one of the fundamental tasks in phylogenetic inference. The recently proposed subsplit Bayesian networks (SBNs) provide a powerful probabilistic graphical model for tree topology probability estimation by properly leveraging the hierarchical structure of phylogenetic trees. However, the expectation maximization (EM) method currently used for learning SBN parameters does not scale up to large data sets. In this paper, we introduce several computationally efficient methods for training SBNs and show that variance reduction could be the key for better performance. Furthermore, we also introduce the variance reduction technique to improve the optimization of SBN parameters for variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference (VBPI). Extensive synthetic and real data experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform previous baseline methods on the tasks of tree topology probability estimation as well as Bayesian phylogenetic inference using SBNs.</description>

      <title>Determinism vs. stochasticity in competitive flour beetle communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As ecologists increasingly adopt stochastic models over deterministic ones, the question arises: when is this a positive development and when is this an unnecessary complication? While deterministic models -- like the Lotka-Volterra model -- provide straightforward predictions about competitive outcomes, they are often unrealistic. Stochastic models are more realistic, but their complexity can limit their usefulness in explaining coexistence. Here, we investigate the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in competition between two flour beetle species, Tribolium castaneum and Tribolium confusum. Specifically, we use highly-replicated one-generation experiments (784 microcosms) to parameterize a mechanistic model. Both the full stochastic model and the underlying deterministic skeleton exhibit priority effects, where one species excludes the other, but the identity of the winning species depends on initial abundances. Stochasticity makes the identity of the winner less predictable, but deterministic dynamics still make reliable predictions (94\% accuracy across a range of reasonable initial abundances). We conclude that deterministic population dynamics are sufficient to account for patterns of coexistence (or lack thereof), a potentially general finding that is supported by recent field studies. Additionally, we resolve longstanding issues in flour beetle research by identifying selective egg predation as the mechanism for priority effects, demonstrating the primacy of demographic stochasticity (compared to environmental stochasticity), and reinterpreting classic competition experiments to show that apparent coexistence often represents long-term transient dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stratified dispersal explains mountain pine beetle's range expansion in Alberta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mountain pine beetle (MPB), a destructive pest native to Western North America, has recently extended its range into Alberta, Canada. Predicting the dispersal of MPB is challenging due to their small size and complex dispersal behavior. Because of these challenges, estimates of MPB's typical dispersal distances have varied widely, ranging from 10 meters to 18 kilometers. Here, we use high-quality data from helicopter and field-crew surveys to parameterize a large number of dispersal kernels. We find that fat-tailed kernels -- those which allow for a small number of long-distance dispersal events -- consistently provide the best fit to the data. Specifically, the radially-symmetric Student's t-distribution with parameters {\nu} = 0.012 and {\rho} = 1.45 stands out as parsimonious and user-friendly; this model predicts a median dispersal distance of 60 meters, but with the 95th percentile of dispersers travelling nearly 5 kilometers. The best-fitting mathematical models have biological interpretations. The Student's t-distribution, derivable as a mixture of diffusive processes with varying settling times, is consistent with observations that most beetles fly short distances while few travel far; early-emerging beetles fly farther; and larger beetles from larger trees exhibit greater variance in flight distance. Finally, we explain why other studies have found such a wide variation in the length scale in MPB dispersal, and we demonstrate that long-distance dispersal events are critical for modelling MPB range expansion.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary emergence of biological intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterising the intelligence of biological organisms is challenging. This work considers intelligent algorithms developed evolutionarily within neural systems. Mathematical analyses unveil a natural equivalence between canonical neural networks, variational Bayesian inference under a class of partially observable Markov decision processes, and differentiable Turing machines, by showing that they minimise the shared Helmholtz energy. Consequently, canonical neural networks can biologically plausibly equip Turing machines and conduct variational Bayesian inferences of external Turing machines in the environment. Applying Helmholtz energy minimisation at the species level facilitates deriving active Bayesian model selection inherent in natural selection, resulting in the emergence of adaptive algorithms. In particular, canonical neural networks with two mental actions can separately learn transition mappings of multiple Turing machines. These propositions were corroborated by numerical simulations of algorithm implementation and neural network evolution. These notions offer a universal characterisation of biological intelligence emerging from evolution in terms of Bayesian model selection and belief updating.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of transmission networks for infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing transmission networks is essential for identifying key factors like superspreaders and high-risk locations, which are critical for developing effective pandemic prevention strategies. In this study, we developed a Bayesian framework that integrates genomic and temporal data to reconstruct transmission networks for infectious diseases. The Bayesian transmission model accounts for the latent period and differentiates between symptom onset and actual infection time, enhancing the accuracy of transmission dynamics and epidemiological models. Additionally, the model allows for the transmission of multiple pathogen lineages, reflecting the complexity of real-world transmission events more accurately than models that assume a single lineage transmission. Simulation results show that the Bayesian model reliably estimates both the model parameters and the transmission network. Moreover, hypothesis testing effectively identifies direct transmission events. This approach highlights the crucial role of genetic data in reconstructing transmission networks and understanding the origins and transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Indirect reciprocity under opinion synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a key explanation for the exceptional magnitude of cooperation among humans. This literature suggests that a large proportion of human cooperation is driven by social norms and individuals' incentives to maintain a good reputation. This intuition has been formalized with two types of models. In public assessment models, all community members are assumed to agree on each others' reputations; in private assessment models, people may have disagreements. Both types of models aim to understand the interplay of social norms and cooperation. Yet their results can be vastly different. Public assessment models argue that cooperation can evolve easily, and that the most effective norms tend to be stern. Private assessment models often find cooperation to be unstable, and successful norms show some leniency. Here, we propose a model that can organize these differing results within a single framework. We show that the stability of cooperation depends on a single quantity: the extent to which individual opinions turn out to be correlated. This correlation is determined by a group's norms and the structure of social interactions. In particular, we prove that no cooperative norm is evolutionarily stable when individual opinions are statistically independent. These results have important implications for our understanding of cooperation, conformity, and polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a periodic traveling wave solution to an integro-difference equation with a piecewise constant growth function exhibiting a stable period2 cycle and strong Allee effect. The mean traveling wave speed is shown to be the asymptotic spreading speed of solutions with compactly supported initial data under appropriate conditions. We then conduct case studies for the Laplace kernel and uniform kernel.</description>

      <title>Phenotype selection due to mutational robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mutation-selection mechanism of Darwinian evolution gives rise not only to adaptation to environmental conditions but also to the enhancement of robustness against mutations. When two or more phenotypes have the same fitness value, the robustness distribution for different phenotypes can vary. Thus, we expect that some phenotypes are favored in evolution and that some are hardly selected because of a selection bias for mutational robustness. In this study, we investigated this selection bias for phenotypes in a model of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using numerical simulations. The model had one input gene accepting a signal from the outside and one output gene producing a target protein, and the fitness was high if the output for the full signal was much higher than that for no signal. The model exhibited three types of responses to changes in the input signal: monostable, toggle switch, and one-way switch. We regarded these three response types as three distinguishable phenotypes. We constructed a randomly generated set of GRNs using the multicanonical Monte Carlo method originally developed in statistical physics and compared it to the outcomes of evolutionary simulations. One-way switches were strongly suppressed during evolution because of their lack of mutational robustness. By examining one-way switch GRNs in detail, we found that mutationally robust GRNs obtained by evolutionary simulations and non-robust GRNs obtained by McMC have different network structures. While robust GRNs have a common core motif, non-robust GRNs lack this motif. The bistability of non-robust GRNs is considered to be realized cooperatively by many genes, and these cooperative genotypes have been suppressed by evolution.</description>

      <title>Bi-parental Reproduction may Enhance Species Sustainability by Conserving Shared Parental Traits more Faithfully than Mono-parental Reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many recognized effects of sexual reproduction and other forms of bi-parental reproduction on the sustainment and evolution of species. They include increased diversity, accelerated adaptation, constrained accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the homogenization of species' genotype. Nevertheless, many questions remain open regarding the evolution of bi-parental reproduction. Here we explore some of the finer details of the homogenization effect, which we believe deserve deeper analysis and discussion. We present a first-cut mathematical analysis, which suggests that bi-parental reproduction enhances the retention of shared, common properties of the parent generation in their offspring, as compared with mono-parental, clonal reproduction. For illustration, we accompany the mathematical claim and proof with several simulation examples depicting and comparing bi- and mono-parental reproduction of real numbers, images of printed text, and images of flowers. We argue that the retention of shared traits of preceding generations is an intrinsic effect of merging the encodings of parents' traits, regardless of physical, chemical, biological and social aspects of the reproduction process and of the specific trait at hand. As survival of offspring often depends on their ability to step in and fill voids left by failing, dying or absent members of the species in vital interaction networks, retention of common properties across generations helps sustain the species. This side-effect of sexual reproduction may have also contributed to the very evolution and pervasiveness of sexual reproduction in nature.</description>

      <title>What you saw is what you got? -- Correcting reported incidence data for testing intensity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions played an important role in the efforts to control outbreaks and to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In certain countries, large-scale voluntary testing of non-symptomatic individuals was done, with the aim of identifying asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections as well as gauging the prevalence in the general population. In this work, we present a mathematical model, used to investigate the dynamics of both observed and unobserved infections as a function of the rate of voluntary testing. The model indicate that increasing the rate of testing causes the observed prevalence to increase, despite a decrease in the true prevalence. For large testing rates, the observed prevalence also decrease. The non-monotonicity of observed prevalence explains some of the discrepancies seen when comparing uncorrected case-counts between countries. An example of such discrepancy is the COVID-19 epidemics observed in Denmark and Hungary during winter 2020/2021, for which the reported case-counts were comparable but the true prevalence were very different. The model provides a quantitative measure for the ascertainment rate between observed and true incidence, allowing for test-intensity correction of incidence data. By comparing the model to the country-wide epidemic of the Omicron variant (BA.1 and BA.2) in Denmark during the winter 2021/2022, we find a good agreement between the cumulative incidence as estimated by the model and as suggested by serology-studies. While the model does not capture the full complexity of epidemic outbreaks and the effect of different interventions, it provides a simple way to correct raw case-counts for differences in voluntary testing, making comparison across international borders and testing behaviour possible.</description>

      <title>Individual based SIS models on (not so) dense large random networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a stochastic individual-based description of an SIS epidemic spreading on a random network, we study the dynamics when the size $n$ of the network tends to infinity. We recover in the limit an infinite-dimensional integro-differential equation studied by Delmas, Dronnier and Zitt (2022) for an SIS epidemic propagating on a graphon. Our work covers the case of dense and sparse graphs, provided that the number of edges grows faster than $n$, but not the case of very sparse graphs with $O(n)$ edges. In order to establish our limit theorem, we have to deal with both the convergence of the random graphs to the graphon and the convergence of the stochastic process spreading on top of these random structures: in particular, we propose a coupling between the process of interest and an epidemic that spreads on the complete graph but with a modified infection rate.
  Keywords: Random graph, mathematical models of epidemics, measure-valued process, large network limit, limit theorem, graphon.</description>

      <title>Lane formation and aggregation spots in a model of ants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting particle model to simulate a foraging colony of ants, where each ant is represented as an active Brownian particle. The interactions among ants are mediated through chemotaxis, aligning their orientations with the upward gradient of the pheromone field. Unlike conventional models, our study introduces a parameter that enables the reproduction of two distinctive behaviors: the well-known Keller--Segel aggregation into spots and the formation of traveling clusters, without relying on external constraints such as food sources or nests. We consider the associated mean-field limit partial differential equation (PDE) of this system and establish the analytical and numerical foundations for understanding these particle behaviors. Remarkably, the mean-field PDE not only supports aggregation spots and lane formation but also unveils a bistable region where these two behaviors compete. The patterns associated with these phenomena are elucidated by the shape of the growing eigenfunctions derived from linear stability analysis. This study not only contributes to our understanding of complex ant colony dynamics but also introduces a novel parameter-dependent perspective on pattern formation in collective systems.</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modeling-papers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a graphical map, a new correspondence between circular electrical networks and circular planar split systems. When restricted to the planar circular electrical case, this graphical map finds the split system associated uniquely to the Kalmanson resistance distance of the dual network, matching the induced split system familiar from phylogenetics. This is extended to compactifications of the respective spaces, taking cactus networks to the newly defined compactified split systems. The graphical map preserves both components and cactus structure, allowing an elegant enumeration of induced phylogenetic split systems.</description>
