      <title>Decommissioning and Post-Irradiation Examination of the LHC Beam Dumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHC beam dumps are responsible for the safe absorption of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle beams. In 2018, the two 6.4-tonne beam dumps that had been in operation since the LHC's startup in 2008 were removed and replaced with upgraded versions. Endoscopic inspections of these beam dumps and experimental high-intensity proton-beam irradiation of material samples raised concerns about the structural integrity of the carbon-based materials in their cores. It was therefore decided to undertake an accelerated project of dismantling and post-irradiation examination of the removed dumps as part of a wider program of work to ensure the safe operation of the LHC beam dumps in the coming years. This paper describes the decommissioning process for the two beam dumps carried out at CERN between 2021 and 2023, covering the preparatory studies, practical challenges encountered, and solutions implemented. It details the establishment of an operational framework, including the preparation of the working environment, the development of a method for cutting the irradiated 12-mm-thick duplex stainless-steel vessel, and the cut sequencing. Additionally, the paper presents the findings derived from the post-irradiation examination of the different carbon-based core materials subjected to deposited energy densities up to 1.5 kJ/g. The extruded graphite plates within the vessel exhibited a cracking pattern, which was likely due to the dynamic response of the device upon beam impact, and their retaining rings were found to be displaced. Despite minor signs of surface deterioration, the expanded graphite sheets were intact, and the isostatic graphite blocks showed no evidence of material degradation.</description>

      <title>Chaos indicators for non-linear dynamics in circular particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The understanding of non-linear effects in circular storage rings and colliders based on superconducting magnets is a key issue for the luminosity the beam lifetime optimisation. A detailed analysis of the multidimensional phase space requires a large computing effort when many variants of the magnetic lattice, representing the realisation of magnetic errors or configurations for performance optimisation, have to be considered. Dynamic indicators for chaos detection have proven to be very effective in finding and distinguishing the weakly-chaotic regions of phase space where diffusion takes place and regions that remain stable over time scales in the order of multiple hours of continuous operation. This paper explores the use of advanced chaos indicators, including the Fast Lyapunov Indicator with Birkhoff weights and the Reverse Error Method, in realistic lattice models for the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Their convergence, predictive power, and potential to define a magnetic lattice quality factor linked to long-term dynamic aperture are assessed. The results demonstrate the efficiency of these indicators in identifying chaotic dynamics, offering valuable insights of these chaos indicators for optimising accelerator lattices with reduced computational cost compared to the classical approach based on CPU-demanding long-term tracking campaigns.</description>
