      <title>Autonomous Grid-Forming Inverter Exponential Droop Control for Improved Frequency Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the novel Droop-e grid-forming power electronic converter control strategy, which establishes a non-linear, active power--frequency droop relationship based on an exponential function of the power output. A primary advantage of Droop-e is an increased utilization of available power headroom that directly mitigates system frequency excursions and reduces the rate of change of frequency. The motivation for Droop-e as compared to a linear grid-forming control is first established, and then the full controller is described, including the mirrored inversion at the origin, the linearization at a parameterized limit, and the auxiliary autonomous power sharing controller. The analytic stability of the controller, including synchronization criteria and a small signal stability analysis, is assessed. Electromagnetic transient time domain simulations of the Droop-e controller with full order power electronic converters and accompanying DC-side dynamics, connected in parallel with synchronous generators, are executed at a range of dispatches on a simple 3-bus system. Finally, IEEE 39-bus system simulations highlight the improved frequency stability of the system with multiple, Droop-e controlled grid-forming inverters.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for 2-contraction of a feedback interconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistationarity - the existence of multiple equilibrium points - is a common phenomenon in dynamical systems from a variety of fields, including neuroscience, opinion dynamics, systems biology, and power systems. A recently proposed generalization of contraction theory, called $k$-contraction, is a promising approach for analyzing the asymptotic behaviour of multistationary systems. In particular, all bounded trajectories of a time-invariant 2-contracting system converge to an equilibrium point, but the system may have multiple equilibrium points where more than one is locally stable. An important challenge is to study $k$-contraction in large-scale interconnected systems. Inspired by a recent small-gain theorem for 2-contraction by Angeli et al., we derive a new sufficient condition for 2-contraction of a feedback interconnection of two nonlinear dynamical systems. Our condition is based on (i) deriving new formulas for the 2-multiplicative [2-additive] compound of block matrices using block Kronecker products [sums], (ii) a hierarchical approach for proving standard contraction, and (iii) a network small-gain theorem for Metzler matrices. We demonstrate our results by deriving a simple sufficient condition for 2-contraction in a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Movement Delay for Movable Antennas via Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have received increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability of antenna position adjustment to reconfigure wireless channels. However, moving MAs results in non-negligible delay, which may decrease the effective data transmission time. To reduce the movement delay, we study in this paper a new MA trajectory optimization problem. In particular, given the desired destination positions of multiple MAs, we aim to jointly optimize their associations with the initial MA positions and the trajectories for moving them from their respective initial to destination positions within a given two-dimensional (2D) region, such that the delay of antenna movement is minimized, subject to the inter-MA minimum distance constraints in the movement. However, this problem is a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that is challenging to solve. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-stage optimization framework that sequentially optimizes the MAs' position associations and trajectories, respectively. First, we relax the inter-MA distance constraints and optimally solve the resulted delay minimization problem. Next, we check if the obtained MA association and trajectory solutions satisfy the inter-MA distance constraints. If not satisfied, we then employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to adjust the MAs' trajectories until they satisfy the given constraints. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory optimization method in reducing the movement delay as well as draw useful insights.</description>

      <title>From Time-Invariant to Uniformly Time-Varying Control Barrier Functions: A Constructive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and analyze a subclass of (time-invariant) Control Barrier Functions (CBF) that have favorable properties for the construction of uniformly timevarying CBFs and thereby for the satisfaction of uniformly time-varying constraints. We call them {\Lambda}-shiftable CBFs where {\Lambda} states the extent by which the CBF can be varied by adding a time-varying function. Moreover, we derive sufficient conditions under which a time-varying CBF can be obtained from a time-invariant one, and we propose a systematic construction method. Advantageous about our approach is that a {\Lambda}-shiftable CBF, once constructed, can be reused for various control objectives. In the end, we relate the class of {\Lambda}-shiftable CBFs to Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF), and we illustrate the application of our results with a relevant simulation example.</description>

      <title>Towards learning digital twin: case study on an anisotropic non-ideal rotor system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, the digital twin (DT) is becoming a central topic. It has the potential to enhance the efficiency of manufacturing machines and reduce the frequency of errors. In order to fulfill its purpose, a DT must be an exact enough replica of its corresponding physical object. Nevertheless, the physical object endures a lifelong process of degradation. As a result, the digital twin must be modified accordingly in order to satisfy the accuracy requirement. This article introduces the novel concept of "learning digital twin (LDT)," which concentrates on the temporal behavior of the physical object and highlights the digital twin's capacity for lifelong learning. The structure of a LDT is first described. Then, in-depth descriptions of various algorithms for implementing each component of a LDT are provided. The proposed LDT is validated on the simulated degradation process of an anisotropic non-ideal rotor system.</description>

      <title>Dual Grid-Forming Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a dual model for grid-forming (GFM) controlled converters. The model is inspired from the observation that the structures of the active and reactive power equations of lossy synchronous machine models are almost symmetrical in terms of armature resistance and transient reactance. The proposed device is able to compensate grid power unbalance without requiring a frequency signal. In fact, the active power control is based on the rate of change of the voltage magnitude. On the other hand, synchronization and frequency control is obtained through the reactive power support. The letter shows that the proposed dual-GFM control is robust and capable of recovering a normal operating condition following large contingencies, such as load outages and three-phase faults.</description>

      <title>Quadratic estimation for stochastic systems in the presence of random parameter matrices, time-correlated additive noise and deception attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked systems usually face different random uncertainties that make the performance of the least-squares (LS) linear filter decline significantly. For this reason, great attention has been paid to the search for other kinds of suboptimal estimators. Among them, the LS quadratic estimation approach has attracted considerable interest in the scientific community for its balance between computational complexity and estimation accuracy. When it comes to stochastic systems subject to different random uncertainties and deception attacks, the quadratic estimator design has not been deeply studied. In this paper, using covariance information, the LS quadratic filtering and fixed-point smoothing problems are addressed under the assumption that the measurements are perturbed by a time-correlated additive noise, as well as affected by random parameter matrices and exposed to random deception attacks. The use of random parameter matrices covers a wide range of common uncertainties and random failures, thus better reflecting the engineering reality. The signal and observation vectors are augmented by stacking the original vectors with their second-order Kronecker powers; then, the linear estimator of the original signal based on the augmented observations provides the required quadratic estimator. A simulation example illustrates the superiority of the proposed quadratic estimators over the conventional linear ones and the effect of the deception attacks on the estimation performance.</description>

      <title>The AI Risk Repository: A Comprehensive Meta-Review, Database, and Taxonomy of Risks From Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination &amp; toxicity, (2) Privacy &amp; security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &amp; misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic &amp; environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, &amp; limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.</description>

      <title>Late Breaking Results: On the One-Key Premise of Logic Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of logic locking methods has long been predicated on an implicit assumption that only the correct key can unveil the true functionality of a protected circuit. Consequently, a locking technique is deemed secure if it resists a good array of attacks aimed at finding this correct key. This paper challenges this one-key premise by introducing a more efficient attack methodology, focused not on identifying that one correct key, but on finding multiple, potentially incorrect keys that can collectively produce correct functionality from the protected circuit. The tasks of finding these keys can be parallelized, which is well suited for multi-core computing environments. Empirical results show our attack achieves a runtime reduction of up to 99.6% compared to the conventional attack that tries to find a single correct key.</description>

      <title>Courteous MPC for Autonomous Driving with CBF-inspired Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With more autonomous vehicles (AVs) sharing roadways with human-driven vehicles (HVs), ensuring safe and courteous maneuvers that respect HVs' behavior becomes increasingly important. To promote both safety and courtesy in AV's behavior, an extension of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)-inspired risk evaluation framework is proposed in this paper by considering both noisy observed positions and velocities of surrounding vehicles. The perceived risk by the ego vehicle can be visualized as a risk map that reflects the understanding of the surrounding environment and thus shows the potential for facilitating safe and courteous driving. By incorporating the risk evaluation framework into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, we propose a Courteous MPC for ego AV to generate courteous behaviors that 1) reduce the overall risk imposed on other vehicles and 2) respect the hard safety constraints and the original objective for efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed Courteous MPC via theoretical analysis and simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>SIMPNet: Spatial-Informed Motion Planning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current robotic manipulators require fast and efficient motion-planning algorithms to operate in cluttered environments. State-of-the-art sampling-based motion planners struggle to scale to high-dimensional configuration spaces and are inefficient in complex environments. This inefficiency arises because these planners utilize either uniform or hand-crafted sampling heuristics within the configuration space. To address these challenges, we present the Spatial-informed Motion Planning Network (SIMPNet). SIMPNet consists of a stochastic graph neural network (GNN)-based sampling heuristic for informed sampling within the configuration space. The sampling heuristic of SIMPNet encodes the workspace embedding into the configuration space through a cross-attention mechanism. It encodes the manipulator's kinematic structure into a graph, which is used to generate informed samples within the framework of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We have evaluated the performance of SIMPNet using a UR5e robotic manipulator operating within simple and complex workspaces, comparing it against baseline state-of-the-art motion planners. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed planner compared to the baseline planners.</description>

      <title>cc-DRL: a Convex Combined Deep Reinforcement Learning Flight Control Design for a Morphing Quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In comparison to common quadrotors, the shape change of morphing quadrotors endows it with a more better flight performance but also results in more complex flight dynamics. Generally, it is extremely difficult or even impossible for morphing quadrotors to establish an accurate mathematical model describing their complex flight dynamics. To figure out the issue of flight control design for morphing quadrotors, this paper resorts to a combination of model-free control techniques (e.g., deep reinforcement learning, DRL) and convex combination (CC) technique, and proposes a convex-combined-DRL (cc-DRL) flight control algorithm for position and attitude of a class of morphing quadrotors, where the shape change is realized by the length variation of four arm rods. In the proposed cc-DRL flight control algorithm, proximal policy optimization algorithm that is a model-free DRL algorithm is utilized to off-line train the corresponding optimal flight control laws for some selected representative arm length modes and hereby a cc-DRL flight control scheme is constructed by the convex combination technique. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed flight control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unsignalized Intersection Management Strategy for Mixed Autonomy Traffic Streams</title>

Abstract: With the rapid development of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and intelligent transportation infrastructure, CAVs, connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs), and un-connected human-driven vehicles (HVs) will coexist on the roads in the future for a long time. This paper comprehensively considers the different traffic characteristics of CHVs, CAVs, and HVs, and systemically investigates the unsignalized intersection management strategy from the upper decision-making level to the lower execution level. The unsignalized intersection management strategy consists of two parts: the heuristic priority queues based right of way allocation (HPQ) algorithm and the vehicle planning and control algorithm. In the HPQ algorithm, a vehicle priority management model considering the difference between CAVs, CHVs, and HVs, is built to design the right of way management for different types of vehicles. In the lower level for vehicle planning and control algorithm, different control modes of CAVs are designed according to the upper-level decision made by the HPQ algorithm. Moreover, the vehicle control execution is realized by the model predictive controller combined with the geographical environment constraints and the unsignalized intersection management strategy. The proposed strategy is evaluated by simulations, which show that the proposed intersection management strategy can effectively reduce travel time and improve traffic efficiency. Results show that the proposed method can decrease the average travel time by 5% to 65% for different traffic flows compared with the comparative methods. The intersection management strategy captures the real-world balance between efficiency and safety for future intelligent traffic systems.</description>

      <title>Equitable Networked Microgrid Topology Reconfiguration for Wildfire Risk Mitigation</title>

Abstract: The increasing number of wildfires in recent years consistently challenges the safe and reliable operations of power systems. To prevent power lines and other electrical components from causing wildfires under extreme conditions, electric utilities often deploy public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) to mitigate the wildfire risks therein. Although PSPS are effective countermeasures against wildfires, uncoordinated strategies can cause disruptions in electricity supply and even lead to cascading failures. Meanwhile, it is important to consider mitigating biased decisions on different communities and populations during the implementation of shutoff actions. In this work, we primarily focus on the dynamic reconfiguration problem of networked microgrids with distributed energy resources. In particular, we formulate a rolling horizon optimization problem allowing for flexible network reconfiguration at each time interval to mitigate wildfire risks. To promote equity and fairness during the span of shutoffs, we further enforce a range of constraints associated with load shedding to discourage disproportionate impact on individual load blocks. Numerical studies on a modified IEEE 13-bus system and a larger-sized Smart-DS system demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm towards more equitable power shutoff operations.</description>

      <title>Consensus over Clustered Networks Using Intermittent and Asynchronous Output Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, multi-agent teaming has garnered considerable interest since complex objectives, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, can be divided into multiple cluster-level sub-tasks and assigned to a cluster of agents with the appropriate functionality. Yet, coordination and information dissemination between clusters may be necessary to accomplish a desired objective. Distributed consensus protocols provide a mechanism for spreading information within clustered networks, allowing agents and clusters to make decisions without requiring direct access to the state of the ensemble. Hence, we propose a strategy for achieving system-wide consensus in the states of identical linear time-invariant systems coupled by an undirected graph whose directed sub-graphs are available only at sporadic times. Within this work, the agents of the network are organized into pairwise disjoint clusters, which induce sub-graphs of the undirected parent graph. Some cluster sub-graph pairs are linked by an inter-cluster sub-graph, where the union of all cluster and inter-cluster sub-graphs yields the undirected parent graph. Each agent utilizes a distributed consensus protocol with components that are updated intermittently and asynchronously with respect to other agents. The closed-loop ensemble dynamics is modeled as a hybrid system, and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis yields sufficient conditions for rendering the agreement subspace (consensus set) globally exponentially stable. Furthermore, an input-to-state stability argument demonstrates the consensus set is robust to a class of perturbations. A numerical simulation considering both nominal and perturbed scenarios is provided for validation purposes.</description>

Abstract: This study confronts the growing challenges of energy consumption and the depletion of energy resources, particularly in the context of smart buildings. As the demand for energy increases alongside the necessity for efficient building maintenance, it becomes imperative to explore innovative energy management solutions. We present a comprehensive review of Internet of Things (IoT)-based frameworks aimed at smart city energy management, highlighting the pivotal role of IoT devices in addressing these issues due to their compactness, sensing, measurement, and computing capabilities. Our review methodology encompasses a thorough analysis of existing literature on IoT architectures and frameworks for intelligent energy management applications. We focus on systems that not only collect and store data but also support intelligent analysis for monitoring, controlling, and enhancing system efficiency. Additionally, we examine the potential for these frameworks to serve as platforms for the development of third-party applications, thereby extending their utility and adaptability. The findings from our review indicate that IoT-based frameworks offer significant potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact in smart buildings. Through the adoption of intelligent mechanisms and solutions, these frameworks facilitate effective energy management, leading to improved system efficiency and sustainability. Considering these findings, we recommend further exploration and adoption of IoT-based wireless sensing systems in smart buildings as a strategic approach to energy management. Our review underscores the importance of incorporating intelligent analysis and enabling the development of third-party applications within the IoT framework to efficiently meet the evolving energy demands and maintenance challenges</description>

      <title>AirPilot: A PPO-based DRL Auto-Tuned Nonlinear PID Drone Controller for Robust Autonomous Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00204</link>

Abstract: Navigation precision, speed and stability are crucial for safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight maneuvers and effective flight mission executions in dynamic environments. Different flight missions may have varying objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, achieving precise positioning, or maximizing speed. A controller that can adapt to different objectives on the fly is highly valuable. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are one of the most popular and widely used control algorithms for drones and other control systems, but their linear control algorithm fails to capture the nonlinear nature of the dynamic wind conditions and complex drone system. Manually tuning the PID gains for various missions can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This paper aims to revolutionize drone flight control by presenting the AirPilot, a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - enhanced Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) drone controller using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). AirPilot controller combines the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional PID control with the adaptability, learning capability, and optimization potential of DRL. This makes it better suited for modern drone applications where the environment is dynamic, and mission-specific performance demands are high. We employed a COEX Clover autonomous drone for training the DRL agent within the simulator and implemented it in a real-world lab setting, which marks a significant milestone as one of the first attempts to apply a DRL-based flight controller on an actual drone. Airpilot is capable of reducing the navigation error of the default PX4 PID position controller by 90%, improving effective navigation speed of a fine-tuned PID controller by 21%, reducing settling time and overshoot by 17% and 16% respectively.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics on signed graphs and graphons: Beyond the piece-wise constant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08372</link>

Abstract: In this paper we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, i.e. competing entities whose opinions can grow apart. We consider both the repelling model and the opposing model that are studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on graphons and we show that their initial value problem's solutions exist and are unique. We then show that the graphon dynamics well approximate the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon. All these facts are illustrated in an extended numerical example.</description>

      <title>"Golden Ratio Yoshimura" for Meta-Stable and Massively Reconfigurable Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yoshimura origami is a classical folding pattern that has inspired many deployable structure designs. Its applications span from space exploration, kinetic architectures, and soft robots to even everyday household items. However, despite its wide usage, Yoshimura has been fixated on a set of design constraints to ensure its flat-foldability. Through extensive kinematic analysis and prototype tests, this study presents a new Yoshimura that intentionally defies these constraints. Remarkably, one can impart a unique meta-stability by using the Golden Ratio angle to define the triangular facets of a generalized Yoshimura. As a result, when its facets are strategically popped out, a ``Golden Ratio Yoshimura'' boom with $m$ modules can be theoretically reconfigured into $8^m$ geometrically unique and load-bearing shapes. This result not only challenges the existing design norms but also opens up a new avenue to create deployable and versatile structural systems.</description>
