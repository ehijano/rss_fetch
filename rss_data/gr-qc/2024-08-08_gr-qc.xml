      <title>Optical appearance of numerical black hole solutions in higher derivative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical appearance of the numerically black hole solutions within the higher derivative gravity illuminated by an accretion disk context is discussed. We obtain solutions for non-Schwarzschild black holes with r0 = 1, r0 = 2, and r0 = 3. Further analysis of spacetime trajectories reveals properties similar to Schwarzschild black holes, while the r0 = 2 black hole exhibits significant differences. The results reveal the presence of a repulsive potential barrier for the black hole, allowing only particles with energies exceeding a certain threshold to approach it, providing a unique gravitational scenario for non-Schwarzschild black holes. Additionally, the optical images are derived through numerical simulations by discussing the trajectories of photons intheblackholespacetime.The distribution of radiation flux and the effects of gravitational redshift and Doppler shift on the observed radiation flux are considered. Interestingly, previous analyses of the optical appearance of black holes were conducted within the framework of analytic solutions, whereas the analysis of numerical black hole solutions first appears in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-0 fields and conserved charges on n-dimensional Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is polyhomogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In four dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for higher dimensions there is only a finite number of non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>

      <title>Precession and higher order multipoles in binary black holes (and lack thereof)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest binary black hole population estimates argue for a subpopulation of unequal component mass binaries with spins that are likely small but isotropically distributed. This implies a non-zero probability of detecting spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipoles moments in the observed gravitational-wave signals. In this work we directly calculate the probability for precession and higher order multipoles in each significant gravitational-wave candidate observed by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaborations (LVK). We find that only one event shows substantial evidence for precession: GW200129_065458, and two events show substantial evidence for higher order multipoles: GW190412 and GW190814; any evidence for precession and higher order multipoles in other gravitational-wave signals is consistent with random fluctuations caused by noise. We then compare our observations with expectations from population models, and confirm that current population estimates from the LVK accurately predict the number of observed events with significant evidence for precession and higher order multipole moments. In particular, we find that this population model predicts that a binary with significant evidence for precession will occur once in every $\sim 50$ detections, and a binary with significant evidence for higher order multipole moments will occur once in every $\sim 70$ observations. However, we emphasise that since substantial evidence for precession and higher order multipole moments have only been observed in three events, any population model that includes a subpopulation of binaries yielding $\sim 2\%$ of events with detectable precession and higher order multipole moments will likely be consistent with the data.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel Gravity and Quintessence: The Role of Nonminimal Boundary Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have outlined the development of an autonomous dynamical system within a general scalar-tensor gravity framework. This framework encompasses the overall structure of the non-minimally coupled scalar field functions for both the torsion scalar ($T$) and the boundary term ($B$). We have examined three well-motivated forms of potential functions and constrained the model parameters through dynamical system analysis. This analysis has played a crucial role in identifying cosmologically viable models. We have analysed the behaviour of dynamical parameters such as equation-of-state parameters for dark energy and the total, as well as all the standard density parameters for radiation, matter, and dark energy to assess their compatibility with current observational data. The phase space diagrams are presented to support the stability conditions of the corresponding critical points. The Universe is apparent in its late-time cosmic acceleration phase via the dark energy-dominated critical points. Additionally, we compare our findings with the most prevailing $\Lambda$CDM model. The outcomes are further inspected using the cosmological data sets of Supernovae Ia and the Hubble rate H(z).</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Modified $f(\mathcal{G})$ Gravity: A Late Time Cosmic Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have introduced a numerical method for solving the Friedmann equations of modified $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity in the presence of pressureless matter, enabling us to predict the redshift behavior of the Hubble expansion rate. To evaluate the credibility of the model, we applied a Bayesian MCMC technique using late-time cosmic observations to impose limitations on the free parameters of the theory. Our results suggest that the $f(\mathcal{G})$ model can reproduce the low-redshift behavior of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but there are significant differences at high redshifts, leading to the absence of a standard matter-dominated epoch. We also examined the profiles of cosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the standard range to verify the intermediate epochs. Our analysis shows that the highly promising $f(\mathcal{G})$ model is a feasible candidate for explaining the current epochs. We presented a dynamical system analysis framework to examine the stability of the model. Our study identified critical points depicting various phases of the Universe and explained the evolutionary epochs. We demonstrated that the model effectively captures the evolution of energy components over cosmic time, supporting its validity as an alternate explanation for the observed acceleration of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Spacetime constructed from a contact manifold with a degenerate metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional spacetime using a three-dimensional contact manifold equipped with a degenerate metric. The degenerate metric is set to be compatible with the contact structure. The compatibility condition is defined in this paper. Our construction yields a Ricci tensor of a particularly simple form, which leads to a solution of the Einstein equation with a null dust and cosmic strings. The solution includes two arbitrary functions: the energy density of the null dust and the number density of the cosmic strings. When there exist the cosmic strings, the spacetime is of Petrov type D. Otherwise, the spacetime is conformally flat. For some simple matter densities, we examine the Einstein equation in detail.</description>

      <title>Two novel $f(Q)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two novel models in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity to explain our accelerated universe, namely the exponential $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model and the hyperbolic tangent $f(Q)_{HT}$ model. The current cosmological electromagnetic observations including the cosmic microwave background anisotropies (CMB), the baryon acoustic oscillations(BAO), the type Ia supernovae (SN) and the direct measurements of H(z), combined with the simulated gravitational-wave data are used to constrain the $f(Q)$ models. We find that the Hubble tension can be significantly alleviated to $1.40\sigma$ level in the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model. The fitting $\chi^2$ of the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model is $9.75\sigma$ poorer than that of the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model, implying the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model would be excluded by future gravitational-wave observation.</description>

      <title>Energy change and Landauer's principle in the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a general description of the system evolution under the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory up to the second order perturbation, which is also referred to as the simplified model of light-matter interaction. The results are classified into rotating and counter-rotating wave terms, the former corresponding to stimulated absorption and emission, and the latter to Unruh and inverse Unruh effects. We obtain not only the reduced density matrix of the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the environment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field theory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the expectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the temporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the conventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a "temperature", which raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer's principle. We prove that Landauer's principle still holds for any state of motion.</description>

      <title>Black Hole singularity and its possible mitigations: Reformulation of Penrose Singularity theorem using null Raychaudhuri matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of null Raychaudhuri matrix motivated by the matrix representation of tensor fields. The evolution of this matrix gives the matrix form of null Raychaudhuri equation. Using this distinct geometric approach, we have reformulated the original Penrose singularity theorem on Black-Hole and have commented on the characteristic of the Raychaudhuri matrix at the singularity. The paper also suggests two possible mitigations for the physical singularity of Schwarzschild black hole via the Wheeler-DeWitt formalism and Bohemian formalism.</description>

      <title>Violations of energy conservation in Horava-Lifshitz gravity: a new ingredient in the dark matter puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity and more general theories where the local Hamiltonian constraint is lost, for example due to the time variability of the Lagrangian (e.g. via its parameters) where time is defined on a foliation according to a prescription mimicking Lambda and 4-volume time in unimodualr gravity. In one direction we subject the multitude of parameters in HL to this variability game, mimicking RG flow in a cosmological setting. In the opposite direction, we examine the evolution on the left-over Hamiltonian should the HL algebra of constraints be still applicable, rather than the algebra of General Relativity being restored. Within the projectable theory, the non-vanishing Hamiltonian can be reinterpreted as a pressureless fluid. Unlike in theories with similar variability based on GR, violations of stress-energy tensor conservation persist, and these are computed here for the full class of projectable HL models. The phenomenological implications are examined: remarkably the driven solutions resulting from these energy conservation violations have the correct profiles to flatten the galactic rotation curves in a toy model. Unfortunately this interesting remark does not survive closer scrutiny: neither is the driven solution an attractor, nor does it have the right sign for acceptable values of the HL parameter, certainly for the simplest terms examined. Yet, in this paper we have established a new ingredient in the dark matter mystery, the possibility of energy conservation violation.</description>

      <title>Single-photon interference over 8.4 km urban atmosphere: towards testing quantum effect in curved spacetime with photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum mechanics and general relativity has transformed our understanding of the natural world significantly. However, integrating these two theories presents immense challenges, and their interplay remains untested. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the single-photon interference covering huge space can effectively probe the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity. We developed an alternative design using unbalanced Michelson interferometers to address this and validated its feasibility over an 8.4 km free-space channel. Using a high-brightness single-photon source based on quantum dots, we demonstrated single-photon interference along this long-distance baseline. We achieved a phase measurement precision of 16.2 mrad, which satisfied the measurement requirements for a gravitational redshift at the geosynchronous orbit by five times the standard deviation. Our results confirm the feasibility of the single-photon version of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner experiment for testing the quantum effects in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness Criteria for the Virasoro-Shapiro Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Veneziano amplitude has recently been uniquely bootstrapped from crossing symmetry, faster than power-law falloff at high energies, and a property dubbed level truncation. In this paper we apply this bootstrap approach to fully permutation invariant amplitudes, deriving new deformations of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for graviton scattering in string theory. Superpolynomially soft Regge behavior yields the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude as the unique solution, and we find the string spectrum as an output rather than an input of the bootstrap. While the remaining variations exhibit the same Regge scaling as pure gravity, in the tensionless limit they reproduce remarkable extremal amplitudes that have appeared in bottom-up studies of positivity.</description>

      <title>Proper Time Observables of General Gravitational Perturbations in Laser Interferometry-based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explicitly gauge-invariant observable of {\em any} general gravitational perturbation, $h_{\mu\nu}$ (\textit{not} necessarily due to gravitational waves (GWs)), in a laser interferometry-based GW detector, identifying the signature as the proper time elapsed of the beamsplitter observer, between two events: when a photon passes through the beamsplitter, and when the same photon returns to the beamsplitter after traveling through the interferometer arm and reflecting off the far mirror. Our formalism applies to simple Michelson interferometers and can be generalized to more advanced setups. We demonstrate that the proper time observable for a plane GW is equivalent to the detector strain commonly used by the GW community, though now the common framework can be easily generalized for other types of signals, such as dark matter clumps or spacetime fluctuations from quantum gravity. We provide a simple recipe for computing the proper time observable for a general metric perturbation in linearized gravity and explicitly show that it is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the perturbation, as any physical observable should be.</description>

      <title>Propagation of pulsed light in an optical cavity in a gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All modern theories of gravitation, starting with Newton's, predict that gravity will affect the speed of light propagation. Einstein's theory of General Relativity famously predicted that the effect is twice the Newtonian value, a prediction that was verified during the 1919 solar eclipse. Recent theories of vector gravity can be interpreted to imply that gravity will have a different effect on pulsed light versus continuous-wave (CW) light propagating between the two mirrors of an optical cavity. Interestingly, we are not aware of any previous experiments to determine the relative effect of gravity on the propagation of pulsed versus CW light. In order to observe if there are small differences, we use a 6 GHz electro-optic frequency comb and low-noise CW laser to make careful measurements of the resonance frequencies of a high-finesse optical cavity. Once correcting for the effects of mirror dispersion, we determine that the cavity resonance frequencies for pulsed and CW light are the same to within our experimental error, which is on the order of $10^{-12}$ of the optical frequency, and one part in 700 of the expected gravitational shift.</description>

      <title>Information theoretic measures for Lifshitz system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied various mixed state information theoretic quantities for an excited state of Lifshitz spacetime in $3+1$-dimensions. This geometry is the gravity dual to a class of $2+1$-dimensional quantum field theories having Lifshitz symmetry. We have holographically calculated mutual information, entanglement wedge cross section, entanglement negativity and mutual complexity for strip like subsystems at the boundary. For this we have used the results of holographic entanglement entropy and complexity present in the literature. We first calculate all of these mentioned quantities for the pure state of Lifshitz spacetime. Then we have moved on to calculate all these quantities for excited state of the Lifshitz spacetime. The gravity dual of excited state of Lifshitz systems in field theory can be obtained by applying constant perturbations along the boundary direction. Further, we would like to mention that for the simplicity of calculation we are only considering results up to the first order in perturbation. The change in the obtained holographic information theoretic quantities are then related to entanglement entropy, entanglement pressure, entanglement chemical potential and charge using the stress tensor complex. These relations are analogous to the first law of entanglement thermodynamics given earlier in the literature. All the calculations are carried out for both values of dynamical scaling exponent ($z$) present in the Lifshitz field theory.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes In The Presence of Axion Field Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of long wavelength entropy fluctuations on cosmological probes such as galaxy clustering, luminosity distance, and CMB temperature anisotropies. Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator scalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the radiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on observables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at the time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\eta^{-2}$ where $\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important for CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed. In particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble tension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a lot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than momentum space.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Rotating Lifshitz Dilaton Black Brane in Quartic Quasitopological gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the rotating Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions in the presence of the quartic quasitopological gravity and then probe the related thermodynamics. At first, we obtain the field equations form which a total constant along the radial coordinate $r$ is deduced. Since we cannot solve the solutions exactly, so we investigate their asymptotic behaviors at the horizon and at the infinity. We attain the conserved and thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, angular velocity, entropy, the energy and the angular momentum densities of the rotating quartic quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. By evaluating the total constant at the horizon and the infinity, we can make a relation between the thermodynamic quantities and so get to a Smarr-type formula. We demonstrate that the thermodynamic quantities of this rotating black brane obey the first law of the thermodynamics. We also study the thermal stability of the rotating quartic quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane and it is not thermally stable.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of dark matter admixed neutron star based on recent observational constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars is modeled using the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach with a mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction, a modified sigma cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut), and the influences of dark matter in the NL (NL DM). Using a Bayesian analysis framework, we evaluate the plausibility and impact of each scenario. Experimental constraints on the general properties of finite nuclei and heavy ion collisions, along with astrophysical observational data on neutron star radii and tidal deformation, have been taken into account. It was shown that all models, including the PREX-II data, were less favored, indicating that this experimental data seemed to be in tension with the other constraints included in the inference procedure, and were incompatible with chiral effective field theoretical calculations of pure neutron matter. Considering the models with no PREX-II constraints, we find the model NL-$\sigma$ cut with the largest Bayes evidence, indicating that the constraints considered favor the stiffening of the EOS at large densities. Conversely, the neutron star with a dark matter component is the least favorable case in light of recent observational constraints, among different scenarios considered here. The $f$ and $p$ modes were calculated within the Cowling approximation, and it can be seen that $f$ modes are sensitive to the EOS. An analysis of the slopes of the mass-radius curves and $f$-mode mass curves has indicated that these quantities may help distinguish the different scenarios.We also analyzed the impact of new PSR J0437-4715 measurements on neutron star mass-radius estimates, noting a $\sim$ 0.2 km reduction in the 90\% CI upper boundary across all models and a significant Bayes evidence decrease, indicating potential conflicts with previous data or the necessity for more adaptable models.</description>

      <title>4D de Sitter from String Theory via 6D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain de Sitter (dS) solutions from controlled string-theory constructions. We review how minimal gauged chiral 6D supergravity evades standard dS no-go theorems by having a positive scalar potential and describe the known 4D classical dS, AdS and Minkowski solutions. Grimm and collaborators recently found a related 6D supergravity by direct F-theory Calabi-Yau flux compactifications and we construct classical 4D maximally symmetric solutions for this 6D supergravity. These provide explicit solutions of the higher-dimensional field equations corresponding to dS, AdS and flat spacetimes in 4D, allowing interesting hierarchies of scales. We show how the singularities of these solutions are consistent with the back-reaction of two space-filling 4D brane-like sources situated within the extra dimensions and infer some of the properties of these sources using the formalism of point particle effective field theory (PPEFT), showing the sources are not vanilla objects like D branes. These tools relate the near-source asymptotic forms of bulk fields to source properties and have been extensively tested for more prosaic physical systems involving the back-reaction of small sources, such as the dependence of atomic energy levels on nuclear properties. We use it to determine the tension of the brane-like sources (that can be positive) and its derivatives. We verify that the solutions are in the weak coupling/large volume regime required to neglect quantum and $\alpha'$ effects.</description>

Abstract: The geometry of 2D Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$ (or Minkowski plane) is similar but fundamentally different from the more familiar Euclidean plane geometry. This note gives an elementary discussion on some basic properties of a triangle on the Minkowski plane. In particular, we show that the theorem of Feuerbach also holds and a use of the incenter/excenters is pointed out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the (anti-)self-duality conditions under which the electric and magnetic parts of the conserved charges of the dyonic Kerr-Newman-NUT-AdS solution become equivalent. Within a holographic framework, the stress tensor and the boundary Cotton tensor are computed from the electric/magnetic content of the Weyl tensor. The holographic stress tensor/Cotton tensor duality is recovered along the (anti-)self-dual curve in parameter space. We show that the latter not only implies a duality relation for the mass but also for the angular momentum. The partition function is computed to first order in the saddle-point approximation and a BPS bound is obtained. The ground state of the theory is enlarged to all the (anti-)self-dual configurations when the $SO(4)$ and $U(1)$ Pontryagin densities are introduced. We demonstrate this at the level of the action and variations thereof.</description>

Abstract: We take advantage of the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon propagating in curved spacetime in order to construct a quantum Otto refrigeration cycle. Deriving a lower bound for the relative temperature between the cold and hot reservoirs at which the engine operates, we provide examples of refrigeration cycles in the presence of a uniform gravitational field as well as in the case of a gravitational field produced by a non-rotating spherically symmetric charged body, and the one obtained from the vacuum solution of Einstein's field equations in an expanding universe, as a function of the parameters which describe each spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thermal interpretation of the stochastic formalism of a slow-rolling scalar field in de Sitter (dS) is given. We construct a correspondence between Hubble patches of dS and particles living in another space called an abstract space. By assuming a dual description of scalar fields and classical mechanics in the abstract space, we show that the stochastic evolution of the infrared part of the field is equivalent to the Brownian motion in the abstract space filled with a heat bath of massless particles. The 1st slow-roll condition and the Hubble expansion are also reinterpreted in the abstract space as the speed of light and a transfer of conserved energy, respectively. Inspired by this, we sketch quantum emergent particles, which may realize the Hubble expansion by an exponential particle production. This gives another meaning of dS entropy as entropy per Hubble volume.</description>

      <title>The Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes via conformal transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this second part of our two-series on extracting the Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes, we focus into spacetimes that are conformal transformations of static spacetimes. Our previous investigation builds upon the Unruh-Hawking analogy, which relates the spacetime of a uniformly accelerating observer to the near-horizon region of a black hole, to obtain the Hawking temperature. However, in this work, we explicitly compute the Bogoliubov coefficients associated with incoming and outgoing modes, which not only yields the temperature but also thermal spectrum of particles emitted by a black hole. For illustration, we take the simplest nontrivial example of the linear Vaidya spacetime, which is conformal to the static metric and using this property, we analytically solve the massless scalar field in its background. This allows the explicit computations of the Bogoliubov coefficients to study the particle production in this spacetime. We also derive an expression for the total mass of such dynamical spacetimes using the conformal Killing vector. We then perform differential variations of the mass formula to determine whether the laws of dynamical black hole mechanics correspond to the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamical stability of bootstrapped Newtonian stars following homologous adiabatic perturbations, focusing on objects of low or intermediate compactness. The results show that for stars with homogeneous densities these perturbations induce some oscillatory behaviour regardless of their compactness, density and adiabatic index, which makes them dynamically stable. In the case or polytropes with density profiles approximated by Gaussian distributions, both stable and unstable behaviours are possible. It was also shown that in the limit in which the density profile of the Gaussian density distribution flattens out, the parameter space for which the perturbations result in an oscillatory behaviour increases, which is in agreement with the case of stars with homogeneous densities.</description>

      <title>Power spectra and circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves with parity and Lorentz violations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The violations of parity and Lorentz symmetries in gravity can change the propagating properties of gravitational waves (GWs) in the cosmological background, which can arise from a large number of parity- and Lorentz-violating theories. In this paper, through a systematic parametrization for characterizing possible derivations from the standard GW propagation in general relativity, we study both the parity- and Lorentz-violating effects on the power spectra and the polarization of the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) during the slow-roll inflation. To this end, we calculate explicitly the power spectrum and the corresponding circular polarization of the PGWs analytically by using the uniform asymptotic approximation. It is shown that the new contributions to power spectra contain two parts, one from the parity-violating terms and the other from the Lorentz-violating terms. While the Lorentz-violating terms can only affect the overall amplitudes of PGWs, the parity-violating terms induce nonzero circular polarization of PGWs, i.e., the left-hand and right-hand polarization modes of GWs have different amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel class of vacuum metrics expressible in analytical form was recently found for pure $\mathcal R^2$ gravity, based on a groundwork put forth by Buchdahl in 1962. These Buchdahl-inspired solutions offer a practical framework for testing ${\cal R}^2$ gravity through empirical observations. Within a subclass of asymptotically flat Buchdahl-inspired vacuum spacetimes, we identified a parameter $\epsilon$ measuring the deviation from the classic Schwarzschild metric, which corresponds to $\epsilon=0$. In this paper, we employ observational data from the S2 star's orbit around Sgr A* in the Milky Way galactic center and perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations to probe the effects of the new metrics on the orbit of the S2 star. Our analysis presented herein reports a range at 95\% confidence level on the deviation parameter as $\epsilon\in(-0.6690,\ 0.4452)$. While no decisive evidence either in favor or in disfavor of the asymptotically flat Buchdahl-inspired spacetimes has been achieved, the obtained bound is compatible with the tighter results using other data of different nature as recently reported in Eur.\,Phys.\,J.\,C $\bf 84$, 330 (2024). As a meaningful test probing into a strong-field regime, our present study calls for further observations with prolonged period and improved accuracy in order to tighten the bound for $\epsilon$ using the S2 star orbit.</description>

Abstract: We show how the path integral for gravity and matter on a piecewise flat spacetime can be used to define the physical quantum gravity states and the related transition amplitudes. The physical states are given by the path integrals for open manifolds from a certain topological class, while the corresponding transition amplitudes are obtained by gluing two such open manifolds into a closed one and calculating the corresponding path integral. We also solve the problem of how to associate a quantum gravity state to an effective action. This is done by using the path integral for a closed manifold from the transition-amplitude topological class so that the state which corresponds to the effective action can be choosen to be the Hartle-Hawking or the Vilenkin wavefunction for the vacuum manifold component of the transition-amplitude manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves exhibit the unique signature of their spin-2 nature in processes of wave scattering, due to the interaction between spin and a background spacetime. Since the spin effect is more pronounced for longer wavelengths and gravitational waves sourced by binaries have a long wavelength, it may become an important effect in addition to the wave effect. We study the propagation of gravitational waves lensed by a Kerr black hole by numerically solving the Teukolsky equation with a source term of the equal-mass circular binary, taking into account both spin effect and wave effect. We find helicity-dependent small-period oscillation in the power spectrum of the amplification factor in the forward direction and the oscillation is enhanced as spin of a prograde Kerr black hole increases.</description>

      <title>Constraining Spacetime Dimensions in Quantum Gravity by Scale Invariance and Electric-Magnetic Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a low energy effective theory of $p$-branes in a $D$-dimensional spacetime, and impose two conditions: 1) the theory is scale invariant, and 2) the electric-magnetic dual $(D-p-4)$-branes exist and they obey the same type of interactions to the $p$-branes. (We also assume other natural conditions such as Lorentz invariance but not string theory, supersymmetry, supergravity and so on.) We then ask what $p$ and $D$ are consistent with these conditions. Using simple dimensional analysis, we find that only two solutions are possible: $(p,D)=(2,11)$ and $(p,D)=(2n-1,4n+2)$, ($n=1,2,3,\cdots$). The first solution corresponds to M-theory, and the second solutions at $n=1$ and $n=2$ correspond to self-dual strings in little string theory and D3-branes in type IIB superstring theory, respectively, while the second solutions for $n \ge 3$ are unknown but would be higher spin theories. Thus, quantum gravity (massless spin two theory) satisfying our two conditions would only be superstring theories, and the conditions would be strong enough to characterize superstring theories in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using both the in-out formalism and the monodromy method, we study the emission of charges from near-extremal charged Nariai black holes with the black hole and cosmological horizons close to each other, whose near-horizon geometry is $\mathrm{dS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$. The emission becomes catastrophic for a charge with energy greater than its chemical potential, whose leading exponential factor increases inversely proportional to the separation of two horizons. This implies that near-extremal Nariai black holes with large charges quickly evaporate dominantly through the charge emission and evolve to black holes with a naked singularity, in contrast to near-extremal RN-dS black holes that have the Breitenlohner-Friedman bound below which they become stable against Hawking radiation and Schwinger effect of charge emission. The near-extremal Nariai black holes with small charges, which are close to near-extremal Schwarzschild-dS black holes, emit dominantly charge-neutral particles and evolve to black holes with increasing charge to mass ratio. We illuminate the origin of the catastrophic emission in the phase-integral formulation and monodromy method by comparing near-extremal charged Nariai black holes with near-extremal RN-dS black holes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15897v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of "semi-classical" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor "localized" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another "boundary structure" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic non-Gaussianity with generic vacua and detection prospects in CMB spectral distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming a slow-roll inflationary model where conformal invariance of the Maxwell action is broken via a non-minimal kinetic coupling term, we investigate the non-Gaussian three-point cross-correlation function between the primordial curvature perturbation and the primordial magnetic field, under a fairly general choice of initial vacua for both the scalar and the gauge field sectors. Among the possible triangular configurations of the resulting cross-bispectrum, we find that the squeezed limit leads to local-type non-Gaussianity allowing a product form decomposition in terms of the scalar and magnetic power spectra, which is a generic result independent of any specific choice of the initial states. We subsequently explore its detection prospects in the CMB via correlations between pre-recombination $\mu$-type spectral distortions and temperature anisotropies, sourced by such a primordial cross-correlation. Our analysis with several proposed next-generation CMB missions forecasts a low value of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the $\mu T$ spectrum if both the vacua are assumed to be pure Bunch-Davies. On the contrary, the SNR may be enhanced significantly for non-Bunch-Davies initial states for the magnetic sector within allowed bounds from current CMB data.</description>

      <title>Infrared finite scattering theory: Scattering states and representations of the BMS group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with any massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an "out" state with memory which gives rise to infrared divergences in the standard $S$-matrix. To obtain an infrared-finite scattering theory, one must suitably include states with memory. However, except in the case of QED with massive charged particles, asymptotic states with memory that have finite energy and angular momentum have not been constructed for more general theories (e.g. massless QED, Yang-Mills and quantum gravity). To this end, we construct direct-integral representations over the "Lorentz orbit" of a given memory and classify all "orbit space representations" that have well-defined energy and angular momentum. We thereby provide an explicit construction of a large supply of physical states with memory as well as the explicit action of the BMS charges all states. The construction of such states is a key step toward the formulation of an infrared-finite scattering theory. While we primarily focus on the quantum gravitational case, we outline how the methods presented in this paper can be applied to obtain representations of the Poincar\'e group with memory for more general quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Phase transition catalyzed by primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first-order phase transition catalyzed by primordial black holes~(PBHs) in the early Universe. We find that super-horizon curvature perturbations generated in this scenario lead to the production of gravitational waves when the scalar modes re-enter the horizon. If PBHs with masses about $10^{-13}M_{\odot}$ constitute all dark matter, the first-order electroweak phase transition catalyzed by PBHs can explain the gravitational wave signal observed by pulsar timing array collaborations without the overproduction of PBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that develops the mathematical framework necessary for studying field theories on ``T-Minkowski'' noncommutative spacetimes. These spacetimes constitute a class of noncommutative geometries, introduced in Part I, that are each invariant under distinct quantum group deformations of the Poincar\'e group. All these noncommutative geometries possess certain physically desirable characteristics, which allow me to develop all the tools of differential geometry and functional analysis, that are necessary in order to build consistent and T-Poincar\'e invariant noncommutative classical field theories.</description>

      <title>Superradiance in the Bulk Protects Quantum State Evolution of Rapidly Rotating Matter on the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the rate at which the interior of an AdS black hole evolves is dual to the rate of evolution of the (quantum state of the) strongly coupled matter on the boundary which, according to holography, is dual to the black hole. However, we have shown elsewhere that it seems to be possible, by adjusting the specific angular momentum of an AdS$_5$-Kerr black hole, to reduce this rate to (effectively) zero. We argue that this is unphysical, and that it is prevented by the intervention of a superradiant instability, which causes the black hole to shed angular momentum when the angular velocity exceeds a certain critical value. The precise way in which this works has recently been explained by the ``grey galaxy'' model of the end state, in which the angular momentum is transferred to a ``galactic disc.'' Thus, the black hole itself cannot sustain a specific angular momentum beyond a critical value: there is an effective upper bound. The holographic interpretation is that, beyond a certain limiting specific angular momentum, strongly coupled matter (corresponding to the black hole) will spontaneously shed angular momentum to some other, confined, form of matter (corresponding to the disc). This idea is supported by recent numerical work on ultra-vortical plasmas. Such an upper bound on specific angular momentum would prevent arbitrarily small rates of quantum state evolution on the boundary. We give a tentative discussion of the relevant observational data in the case of the vortical Quark-Gluon Plasma, and suggest a way in which such an upper bound might appear in future observations.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions for 4-D Dyonic AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of four dimensional charged dyonic AdS black holes. By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be extended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical potential $\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$, electric potential vs. charge $(\tilde{\Phi},\tilde{Q})$, and field theory pressure vs. volume $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and taken a dyonic system. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we examined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{\Phi}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined phase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\mu$, we discover a zeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the fixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles exhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state dual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.</description>
