      <title>Applied Causal Inference Powered by ML and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An introduction to the emerging fusion of machine learning and causal inference. The book presents ideas from classical structural equation models (SEMs) and their modern AI equivalent, directed acyclical graphs (DAGs) and structural causal models (SCMs), and covers Double/Debiased Machine Learning methods to do inference in such models using modern predictive tools.</description>

      <title>Matrix-based Prediction Approach for Intraday Instantaneous Volatility Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for predicting intraday instantaneous volatility based on Ito semimartingale models using high-frequency financial data. Several studies have highlighted stylized volatility time series features, such as interday auto-regressive dynamics and the intraday U-shaped pattern. To accommodate these volatility features, we propose an interday-by-intraday instantaneous volatility matrix process that can be decomposed into low-rank conditional expected instantaneous volatility and noise matrices. To predict the low-rank conditional expected instantaneous volatility matrix, we propose the Two-sIde Projected-PCA (TIP-PCA) procedure. We establish asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and conduct a simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed prediction method. Finally, we apply the TIP-PCA method to an out-of-sample instantaneous volatility vector prediction study using high-frequency data from the S&amp;P 500 index and 11 sector index funds.</description>

      <title>Design-Robust Two-Way-Fixed-Effects Regression For Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new estimator for average causal effects of a binary treatment with panel data in settings with general treatment patterns. Our approach augments the popular two-way-fixed-effects specification with unit-specific weights that arise from a model for the assignment mechanism. We show how to construct these weights in various settings, including the staggered adoption setting, where units opt into the treatment sequentially but permanently. The resulting estimator converges to an average (over units and time) treatment effect under the correct specification of the assignment model, even if the fixed effect model is misspecified. We show that our estimator is more robust than the conventional two-way estimator: it remains consistent if either the assignment mechanism or the two-way regression model is correctly specified. In addition, the proposed estimator performs better than the two-way-fixed-effect estimator if the outcome model and assignment mechanism are locally misspecified. This strong double robustness property underlines and quantifies the benefits of modeling the assignment process and motivates using our estimator in practice. We also discuss an extension of our estimator to handle dynamic treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Non-Parametric Sequential Tests and Confidence Sequences with Possibly Dependent Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential tests and their implied confidence sequences, which are valid at arbitrary stopping times, promise flexible statistical inference and on-the-fly decision making. However, strong guarantees are limited to parametric sequential tests that under-cover in practice or concentration-bound-based sequences that over-cover and have suboptimal rejection times. In this work, we consider \cite{robbins1970boundary}'s delayed-start normal-mixture sequential probability ratio tests, and we provide the first asymptotic type-I-error and expected-rejection-time guarantees under general non-parametric data generating processes, where the asymptotics are indexed by the test's burn-in time. The type-I-error results primarily leverage a martingale strong invariance principle and establish that these tests (and their implied confidence sequences) have type-I error rates approaching a desired $\alpha$-level. The expected-rejection-time results primarily leverage an identity inspired by It\^o's lemma and imply that, in certain asymptotic regimes, the expected rejection time approaches the minimum possible among $\alpha$-level tests. We show how to apply our results to sequential inference on parameters defined by estimating equations, such as average treatment effects. Together, our results establish these (ostensibly parametric) tests as general-purpose, non-parametric, and near-optimal. We illustrate this via numerical experiments.</description>
