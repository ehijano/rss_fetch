      <title>X-ray properties of compact elliptical galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the X-ray analysis of seven local compact elliptical galaxies (cEGs), selected for their morphological resemblance to high-redshift red nuggets. As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies - MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 - host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar $\alpha/\rm{Fe}$ abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper $M_{\star}-L_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the $M_{\star}$-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high-redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres. We speculate that the compactness of cEGs may trace back to the population of `little red dots' (LRDs), hinting at a potential link between LRDs, red nuggets, and compact relic galaxies in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>A Census of Compact Elliptical Galaxies in the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact elliptical (cE) galaxies are compact stellar systems with stellar masses of $10^8 \leq M_*/M_\odot \leq 10^{10}$ and radii typically &lt; 0.6 kpc. Here we investigate the properties of 13 cE galaxies in the Coma cluster, six newly identified. Our goal in this paper is to explore whether these cEs form directly in the cluster environment or are pre-processed in small groups before infalling. We find that pre-processing in groups significantly contributes to the cE population in the Coma cluster. We analyze Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) g band Coma images and validate our photometric measurements through comparison with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. We also analyze spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We significantly expand the known cE population in the Coma cluster through joint photometric and spectroscopic selection. We identify a subpopulation of cEs that likely formed in infalling groups, through their association with host galaxies, their positions on the caustic diagram, and their projected phase-space trajectories. We estimate that the central cE population will increase by 30% within the next 0.4 Gyr, highlighting the important role of pre-processing in cE evolution.</description>

      <title>Interaction of the relativistic jet and the narrow-line region of PMN J0948+0022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed publicly available optical spectra of PMN J0948+0022 obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, X-Shooter, and the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Initially, PMN J0948+0022 was classified as a jetted narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, but X-Shooter and MUSE observations, which have better spectral resolution, revealed a different profile for the H$\beta$ line, from Lorentzian to a composite one (a combination of a broad and a narrow Gaussian), more typical of intermediate Seyfert galaxies. According to the unified model, intermediate Seyferts are viewed at larger angles. However, we show that, in this case, the composite line profile results from the interaction of the powerful relativistic jet with the narrow-line region. The jet transfers part of its kinetic energy to the narrow-line region, producing flux changes in the H$\beta$ narrow component (drop by a factor of 3.4 from SDSS to X-Shooter), [O III]$\lambda$5007 core component (which nearly doubled from X-Shooter to MUSE), and its blue wing ($\Delta$v$\sim$200 km s$^{-1}$), which we interpret as evidence of an outflow. We also recalculated the physical parameters of this AGN, obtaining a black hole mass of $10^{7.8}$ M$_{\odot}$ and an Eddington ratio of $\sim$0.21 (weighted mean).</description>

      <title>Optimising the analysis of emission lines in galaxies: the case of the MUSE TIMER galaxy NGC 613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution is driven by spatially distributed processes with varying timescales. Integral field spectroscopy provides spatially-resolved information about these processes. Nevertheless, disentangling these processes, which are related to both the underlying stellar populations and the interstellar medium can be challenging. We present a case study on NGC~613, observed with MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) for the TIMER (Time Inference with MUSE in Extragalactic Rings) project, a local barred galaxy, which shows several gas ionisation mechanisms and is rich in both large and inner-scale stellar structures. We develop a set of steps to overcome fundamental problems in the modelling of emission lines with multiple components, together with the characterisation of the stellar populations. That results in the disentanglement of the gas ionisation mechanisms and kinematics, along with an optimal parametrisation for star formation history recovery. Our analysis reveals evidence of gas inflows, which are associated with the bar dust lanes traced with \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST). In addition, we show the gas kinematics in a central biconical outflow, which is aligned with a radio jet observed with Very Large Array (VLA). The emission line provides estimates of electron density, gas-phase metallicity, and the mass outflow rate, allowing us to distinguish intertwined ionisation mechanisms and to identify a part of the multiphase gas cycle in NGC 613. It traces the gas kinematics from the bar lanes to inner scale gas reservoirs, where it can eventually trigger star formation or AGN activity, as observed in the outflow.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Descriptive Parametric Model: Gaseous Profiles for Galaxies, Groups, and Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and present the Descriptive Parametric Model (DPM), a tool for generating profiles of gaseous halos (pressure, electron density, and metallicity) as functions of radius, halo mass, and redshift. The framework assumes spherically symmetric, volume-filling warm/hot gas, and the DPM framework enables mock observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), group halos, and clusters across a number of wavebands including X-ray, sub-millimeter/millimeter, radio, and ultraviolet (UV). We introduce three model families calibrated to reproduce cluster profiles while having different extrapolations to the CGM -- (i) self-similar halos, (ii) a reduced gas model for lower halo masses, and (iii) a model with shallower radial slopes at lower masses. We demonstrate how our z = 0.0 - 0.6 models perform when applied to stacked and individual X-ray emission profiles, measurements of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect, electron dispersion measures from fast radio bursts, O VI absorption, and UV-derived pressures. Our investigation supports models that remove baryons from halos more effectively and have shallower profiles at lower halo mass. We discuss biases and systematics when modelling observables using consistent hot gaseous halo models for all wavebands explored. We release the DPMhalo code to encourage the use of our framework and new formulations in future investigations. Included with the DPMhalo distribution is a set of recent observations that allow the reproduction of most plots in this paper.</description>

      <title>Fornax dwarf spheroidal in MOND: its formation and the survival of its globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has five massive globular clusters (GCs). They are often used for testing different dark matter and modified gravity theories, because it is difficult to reconcile their old stellar ages with the short time they need to settle in the center of the galaxy due to dynamical friction. Using high resolution $N$-body simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code, we investigate whether the GCs of Fornax can be reconciled with the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), namely its QUMOND formulation. Observational data interpreted in MOND indicate that Fornax is a tidal dwarf galaxy formed at redshift $z=0.9$ in a flyby of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda galaxies, and that its GCs were initially massive star clusters in the disk of the MW. This helps us to set up and interpret the simulations. In the simulations, a point-mass GC orbits Fornax, and they both orbit the MW. When we ran multiple simulations with varying initial conditions for the GC, we found a 20% probability of Fornax being observed with five unsunk GCs. The unsunk GCs have the observed radial distribution. Moreover, we found: 1) In MOND, Fornax has an orbit around the MW such that the pericenters coincide with the observed peaks in the star formation history of Fornax; 2) The simulations reproduce the observed ``diffuse stellar halo'' of Fornax; 3) The simulations predict that Fornax has a stellar stream, which could be detectable in the existing data. 4) An extra simulation shows that if Fornax was initially a rotating disky tidal dwarf galaxy, the gravitational influence of the MW would be able to transform it into a nonrotating spheroidal. 5) Sometimes Phantom of Ramses does not conserve angular momentum. This makes the GC sink too fast if it is simulated as an $N$-body object.</description>

      <title>DESI Data Release 1: Stellar Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14787v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the stellar Value-Added Catalogue (VAC) based on the DESI Data Release 1. This VAC contains stellar parameter, abundance and radial velocity measurements for more than 4 million stars. It also contains, for the first time, measurements from individual epochs for more than a million stars with at least two observations. The main contribution to the catalogue comes from the bright program of the main survey, which includes $\sim $2.5 million stars, and the backup program, which includes $\sim $ 1 million stars. The combined magnitude range for the stars in the catalogue extends from Gaia G $\sim 12$ to G $\sim 21$. For the magnitude range $17.5&lt;G&lt;21$ this catalogue represents a factor of 10 increase in the number of stars with radial velocity and abundance measurements compared to existing surveys. Despite DESI's resolution (R $\sim 2500-5000$), the median radial velocity random error for stars in the catalogue is better than 1 km s$^{-1}$. The stellar parameters and abundances of stars in DESI are measured by two independent pipelines, and after applying a temperature-dependent calibration, [Fe/H] abundances of high signal-to-noise stars are accurate to better than $\sim$ 0.1 dex when compared to high-resolution surveys. The catalogue probes different Galactic components including a particularly large number of distant stars: tens of thousands of stars further than 10 kpc, and thousands further than 50 kpc. The catalogue also contains several thousand extremely metal-poor stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-3$. The released sample of stars includes measurements for thousands of stars that are members of dwarf galaxies, open and globular clusters as well as members of several dozen stellar streams. The next public DESI data release is expected in two years and will contain three times as many stars as DR1.</description>

      <title>Global properties, fractality, and mass segregation in single, paired, and grouped open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and dynamical properties of Open Clusters (OCs) classified as single, in pairs, or in groups. By analysing their mass, size, age, fractality, and mass segregation, we aim to identify systematic differences among these categories and evaluate the role of the Galactic environment in their evolution. Our sample comprises 420 single OCs, 415 in pairs, and 317 in groups. To characterise their structure, we apply the Q-parameter, which distinguishes fractal from radial distributions. We also compute the local density ratio to quantify mass segregation and explore its dependence on environment. Grouped OCs tend to be the youngest, followed by those in pairs, while single OCs generally exhibit older ages. Although sizes are comparable, OCs in pairs and groups tend to be less concentrated. Structurally, grouped OCs show the highest fractality, which decreases with age as clusters evolve towards more radial configurations. Mass segregation is detected in ~80% of OCs, with a slightly higher incidence in single clusters. Some older single OCs show inverse segregation, with massive stars at larger radii. Spatially, single OCs are more dispersed, whereas paired and grouped ones are concentrated in spiral arms and star-forming regions. OC evolution appears to be shaped by both internal dynamics and environmental influences. Single OCs tend to exhibit signs of more advanced dynamical evolution, whereas those in pairs and groups may retain features reflecting their formation environment. Substructures and high fractality in younger clusters suggest that early interactions play a key role in their long-term development. More massive OCs evolve towards radial configurations, while less massive ones may retain fractal properties for longer. These findings highlight the interplay between intrinsic properties and external conditions in shaping OC evolution.</description>

      <title>Dancing Streams In Merging Halos: Stellar Streams in a MW--LMC-like merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams -- formed from tidally stripped globular clusters or dwarf galaxies -- are sensitive tracers of a galaxy's accretion history and gravitational potential. While numerous streams are known in the Milky Way (MW), the formation and evolution of stellar streams have been primarily studied in isolated settings. The impact of subsequent galaxy interactions on stellar streams remains largely unexplored. Understanding merger-induced effects is however, crucial given the accretion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) onto the MW, and the fact that for example M31 and Cen A have experienced recent mergers. We analyze the detailed evolution of 1024 stellar streams during a complete MW--LMC-like merger, systematically varying initial stream properties and considering various orbits for the infalling perturber. We find that an MW--LMC mass-ratio merger significantly alters stellar stream properties, including energy, angular momentum, orbit, and morphology. Some streams exhibit dramatic morphological changes or develop complex substructures, while others see substantial shifts in energy and/or angular momentum, or re-orient their orbital plane. Interestingly, strong morphological alterations do not necessarily correlate with large changes in energy or orbit. A few streams split apart with parts moving to different orbits, appearing disconnected in position and kinematics despite their common origin. Strong effects correlate with close encounters between stream particles and the infalling perturber at various times during the merger. Our findings highlight the considerable impact of significant accretion events on the properties of stellar streams, and the challenge to recover the initial orbits of streams from their appearance at the present-day. Visualizations of the detailed evolution of all 1024 stellar streams are available at https://dancingstreamsinmerginghalos.github.io.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Habitability using Biogenic Precursors: Formaldehyde in Millimeter Molecular Clouds of the Inner Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of formaldehyde (H2CO) absorption and radio recombination line (H110a) emission in 215 molecular clouds from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), observed using the Nanshan 25-m radio telescope. H2CO was detected in 88 sources (40.93 percent) with 59 being new detections, while H110a emission was found in only 11 sources (5.12 percent), all coincident with H2CO absorption. There exists a correlation of H2CO fluxes with millimeter fluxes below a 3 Jy threshold and an increased dispersion above it, suggesting the sub-CMB cooling of H2CO. Cross-matching with kinematic distance catalogs revealed H2CO spanning galactocentric distances from 0.216 to 10.769 kpc, with column densities ranging from 7.82 x 10^11 to 6.69 x 10^14 cm-2. A significant inverse correlation was observed between H2CO detection fraction and galactocentric distance, suggesting enhanced star forming activity closer to the Galactic Center. These findings challenge traditional Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) models by demonstrating the presence of biogenic precursors in the inner Galaxy, shielded within dense molecular clouds. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating chemical tracers like H2CO, alongside physical constraints, to refine the boundaries of the GHZ and advance the research of prebiotic chemistry in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling the mass feeding rates onto accretion-modified stars embedded within AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes can potentially form stars within the self-gravitating region. These stars undergo high accretion rates because of the dense environment of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. The vorticity of the AGN disk may influence the ultimate mass feeding rate toward the star. In our study, we simulate mass feeding rates onto stars at different AGN disk thicknesses through 3D numerical models to explore the relationship between feeding rates and the thermal mass of the star ($q_{\rm th}$), defined as the ratio of the star's Bondi radius to the AGN disk thickness. Our findings indicate that disk shearing with angular momentum can notably decrease the feeding rate, and we provide an approximate formula that links the feeding rate based on the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and the thermal mass $q_{\rm th}$. Lastly, we examine the potential feedback of the rapidly accreting stars on the AGN disk and their subsequent evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the molecular and atomic gas properties of 10 spatially resolved galaxies in the A2626 cluster (z = 0.055), observed as part of the SYMPHANY project. Using CO(2-1) observations from ALMA and SMA, together with HI data from MeerKAT, we examine the interplay between gas phases and environmental influences. A joint morphological and kinematic analysis reveals that while the kinematic behavior of HI and CO are often similar, morphologically the atomic gas is more extended compared to centrally concentrated CO distributions, making it more susceptible to environmental stripping. However, we also find evidence for molecular gas asymmetries, disturbed velocity fields, and H2 deficiencies in some galaxies, indicating that H2 reservoirs can also be disrupted in dense environments. Compared to Virgo-a dynamically unrelaxed, non-cool-core cluster-A2626's relaxed, cool-core structure likely results in less intense ram-pressure stripping. This may allow galaxies to retain more atomic gas, while local interactions or pre-processing may still affect the molecular phase, causing relatively low HI deficiencies but high H2 deficiencies in A2626 galaxies. This is also reflected in the higher gas fractions, slightly elevated SFRs, along with shorter depletion timescales (0.3-3 Gyr), implying moderately enhanced star formation efficiency A2626 galaxies. Moreover, the lack of correlation between H2 deficiency and cluster-centric distance or velocity suggests that molecular gas evolution in A2626 may be shaped more by early infall or local interactions than by current cluster location.</description>

      <title>Star formation at different stages of ram-pressure stripping as observed through far-ultraviolet imaging of 13 GASP galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping develop gaseous tails that can extend several kiloparsecs outside the galaxy disc. We used far-ultraviolet and H$\alpha$ imaging from the GASP survey to investigate how different stages of stripping affect star formation properties in the tail and disc of 13 galaxies undergoing stripping. These galaxies have different stripping strengths, as identified from the MUSE integral field spectroscopy. The star-forming knots in the disc and tails show a good correspondence between the measured FUV and H$\alpha$ flux. This is especially true for strong and extreme cases of stripping, which have developed extended ionized gaseous tails featuring clumpy structures. The mechanism behind the H$\alpha$ emission on the tails of these regions, which correlates well with FUV emission, is photoionization caused by young massive stars. The optical emission line ratio maps enable us to understand the emission mechanism, which can be attributed to star formation, LINER activity, or a combination of both phenomena and AGN. The star-forming regions in the emission line maps correspond well to the areas with significant FUV flux in these galaxies. Six galaxies exhibit minimal star formation in their tails, with two cases star formation is limited to the central regions and their discs are truncated. In galaxies with truncated discs, star formation is confined to a smaller region on the disc, as indicated by the FUV flux, compared to H$\alpha$. Galaxies with strong stripping are undergoing recent star formation and are likely recent infalls. Galaxies with truncated discs confine star formation to the center, likely because they have completed a cluster crossing that depleted most of their outer gaseous disc. Galaxies with minimal FUV flux along their tails exhibit unresolved H$\alpha$ emission which may be attributed to processes other than star formation.</description>

      <title>Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project. V. Velocity-resolved H-beta Reverberation Mapping and Evidence of Kinematics Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present velocity-resolved reverberation lags of H-beta for 20 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project. We detect unambiguous velocity-resolved structures in 12 AGNs, among which eight objects exhibit symmetric structures, two objects show inflow-like characteristics, and two objects display outflow-like signatures. For two AGNs, we successfully measure the velocity-resolved lags in different years, revealing evidence of evolving broad-line region (BLR) kinematics. By combining our sample with the literature velocity-resolved lags, we find that the symmetric velocity-resolved lags are the most common (40%) type among this sample. The frequency of inflow kinematics is also notable (20%), while outflow kinematics are less common (11%). Our sample significantly expands the previous velocity-resolved reverberation mapping sample in the high-luminosity regime, enabling us to constrain BLR kinematics across a large dynamic range of luminosity.</description>

      <title>Spatial and velocity anisotropies of stellar halos across cosmic web environments: Insights from IllustrisTNG simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of large-scale environment in shaping the structural and kinematic properties of stellar halos remains an open question. We investigate whether the cosmic web environments affect the spatial and velocity anisotropies of stellar halos in Milky Way-mass galaxies. Using high-resolution data from the TNG50 simulation, we analyze 29 stellar halos from each environment and quantify their spatial and kinematic anisotropies as a function of halo-centric radius. We find that stellar halos across all environments generally exhibit increasing spatial anisotropy with radius, with fluctuations corresponding to bound substructures. The velocity anisotropy profiles show radially dominated orbits on average, but also display significant local variation, including tangentially dominated regions. However, no statistically significant differences are observed in the mean spatial or velocity anisotropy profiles across environments, for either the total stellar halo population or for the in situ and ex situ components individually. The large scatter within each environment suggests that the formation of stellar halos is primarily driven by stochastic, small-scale processes such as satellite merger histories, rather than the large-scale geometry of the cosmic web. Our results imply that, at fixed halo mass, the influence of cosmic web environment on the structure of stellar halo is weak or highly non-deterministic. Possible environmental effects may be more prominent at higher masses where accretion is more anisotropic. Exploring this regime will require simulations with both larger volume and higher resolution.</description>

      <title>Evolution of broad emission lines from double-peaked to single-peaked to support a central tidal disruption event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, considering evolution of fallback accreting debris in a central Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), the outer boundary increased with time of the disk-like broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disk will lead expected broad emission lines changed from double-peaked to single-peaked. Considering common elliptical orbitals for the accreting fallback TDEs debris, based on simulated results through the preferred standard elliptical accretion disk model, a probability about 3.95\% can be estimated for cases with double-peaked profile changed to single-peaked profile in multi-epoch broad emission lines, indicating such unique profile variability could be indicator for BLRs related to TDE debris. Meanwhile, among the reported optical TDE candidates with apparent broad lines, such profile changes in broad H$\alpha$ can be found in the AT 2018hyz. After accepted the outer boundaries of the disk-like BLRs increased with time, the observed multi-epoch broad H$\alpha$ can be described in AT 2018hyz. Moreover, the elliptical accretion disk model determined time dependent ratios of the outer boundaries of the disk-like BLRs are well consistent with the TDE model expected ratios of the outer boundaries of the fallback TDE debris. Furthermore, the evolution properties of disk-like BLRs can be applied to estimate the locations of the disk-like BLRs of which outer boundary could be about one sixth of the outer boundary of the fallback TDE debris in AT 2018hyz. Such unique profile changes from double-peaked to single-peaked could be applied as further clues to support a central TDE.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and the associated spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays in dynamical galactic halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed understanding of cosmic-ray transport in galactic halos is essential for explaining various observations, such as the radio continuum measurements of synchrotron radiation from energetic electrons. Of central importance is the spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays, which can be computed in an ab initio manner if the turbulence in the background medium is known. The study aimed to establish a suitable framework to compute the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and, hence, the diffusion tensor in the dynamical halos of galaxies. The Reynolds-averaged single-fluid MHD equation were solved numerically on a cylindrical grid, assuming axial symmetry and fixed boundary conditions on a central ellipsoid representing the galaxy. The physical properties of both large-scale MHD and small-scale turbulent quantities, including the coefficients of parallel and perpendicular diffusion, were extracted from the resulting steady state. Hydrodynamic validation revealed a persistent instability of the near-axis flow, which could be traced to the galaxy's gravitating mass. The results for the evolution of MHD turbulence in a galactic halo - using parameters approximating those of NGC4631 - enabled an ab initio computation of the spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays through the application of a state-of-the-art nonlinear theory. The simulation results reveal variation in turbulence quantities, (i.e., fluctuation energy, correlation scale, and cross helicity) in a dynamical halo. Furthermore, the corresponding diffusion tensor of cosmic rays exhibits significant variation throughout such a halo.</description>

      <title>An efficient integrator for stellar dynamics in effective gravity fields based on the isochrone potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Integrating the motion of stars in a smoothed potential is necessary in many stellar and galactic studies. Previous works have often used numerical integrators that alternate between linear drifts and velocity kicks (such as the Leapfrog scheme). This approach contrasts with the sophisticated methods developed in planetary dynamics, for which integrators alternate between Keplerian drifts and velocity kicks.
  Aims. Inspired by the splitting methods used in planetary dynamics, we aim to build an integration scheme dedicated to stellar and galactic dynamics.
  Methods. We took advantage of the properties of H\'enon's isochrone potential to design a symplectic splitting scheme that can be used to integrate the motion of stars in any gravitational potential. This scheme alternates between isochrone drifts and velocity kicks. As a first application, we consider the motion of a star in a Plummer potential -- an essential constituent of galactic potentials -- and determine integration parameters that provide the best efficiency (i.e. best conservation of energy for lowest computational cost).
  Results. We derive the analytical solution for all kinds of orbits in H\'enon's isochrone potential (bound and unbound trajectories) as needed in our integration scheme. Our experiments for stars in a Plummer potential show excellent performances in the inner and outer parts of the gravity field, that is, where the motion of stars is well approximated by isochrone trajectories (with perturbations of order $10^{-3}$ or less). For highly elongated orbits that cross the characteristic length of the Plummer potential, the performance is equivalent to that of previous methods.
  Conclusions. The splitting scheme presented here is a good alternative to previous methods: it performs at least as well, and up to orders of magnitude better, depending on the dynamical regime of the star.</description>

      <title>The Sagittarius stellar stream embedded in a fermionic dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams are essential tracers of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, with key implications to the problem of dark matter (DM) model distributions, either within or beyond phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos. For the first time in the literature, a DM halo model based on first physical principles such as quantum statistical mechanics and thermodynamics is used to try to reproduce the 6D observations of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream. We model both DM haloes, the one of Sgr dwarf and the one of its host with a spherical self-gravitating system of neutral fermions which accounts for the effects of particles escape and fermion degeneracy, the latter causing a high-density core at the center of the halo. Full baryonic components for each galaxy are also considered. We use a spray algorithm with $\sim 10^{5}$ particles to generate the Sgr tidal debris, which evolves in the gravitational potential of the host-progenitor system, to compare with the full phase-space data of the stream. We repeat this kind of simulations for different parameter setups of the fermionic model including the particle mass, with special attention to test different DM halo morphologies allowed by the physics. We find that across the different families of fermionic halo models, they can only reproduce the trailing arm of the Sgr stream. Within the observationally allowed span of enclosed masses where the stream moves, neither the power-law like, nor the polytropic behaviour of the fermionic halo models can answer for the observed trend of the leading tail. A conclusion which is shared by former analysis using other type of spherically symmetric haloes. We conclude that further model sophistications such as abandoning spherical symmetry and including the Large Magellanic Cloud perturber are needed for a proper modelisation of the overall Milky Way potential within this kind of first principle halo models.</description>

      <title>Stellar population modelling of neutron stars and black holes: spatially-resolved graveyards in MaNGA/SDSS-IV galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update our stellar population models for the time evolution of the number and mass of massive remnants - neutron stars and black holes - with a new initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae. The calculations are based on hydrodynamical simulations and induced explosions of a subset of previously published pre-supernovae models spanning a wide range of stellar mass, metallicity and different values for rotation velocity. The resulting stellar population models predict lower numbers of neutron stars (by up to 0.3 dex) and higher numbers of black holes (by up to 0.8 dex), especially when stellar rotation is considered. The mass fraction locked in neutron stars and black holes is lowest in high-metallicity populations, with the largest number of remnants found at about half-solar metallicity. This mirrors the amount of available gas, ranging from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. We then apply our new models to IFU spectra for ~10,000 galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey for which we previously published spatially-resolved star formation histories. This allows us to probe spatially-resolved graveyards in galaxies of different types. The number and radial distribution of remnants depend on a galaxy's mass, star formation history and metal content. More massive and hence more metal-rich galaxies are found to host fewer remnants. Radial gradients in the number of remnants depend on galaxy mass mostly because of the mass-dependent profiles in mass density: the gradients are flat in low-mass galaxies, and negative in high-mass galaxies, particularly in Milky Way analogues.</description>

      <title>Quasar radiation transforms the gas in a merging companion galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars, powered by gas accretion onto supermassive black holes, rank among the most energetic objects of the Universe. While they are thought to be ignited by galaxy mergers and affect the surrounding gas, observational constraints on both processes remain scarce. Here we unveil a major merging system at redshift $z \approx 2.7$, and demonstrate that radiation from the quasar in one galaxy directly alters the gas properties in the other galaxy. Our findings reveal that the galaxies, with centroids separated by only a few kiloparsecs and approaching each other at speed $\approx550\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$, are massive, form stars, and contain a substantial molecular mass. Yet, dusty molecular gas seen in absorption against the quasar nucleus is highly excited and confined within cloudlets with densities $\sim 10^5$ - $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and sizes $&lt;$0.02 pc, several orders of magnitude more compact than those observed in intervening (non-quasar) environments. This is also approximately 10$^5$ times smaller than currently resolvable through molecular-line emission at high redshifts. We infer that, wherever exposed to the quasar radiation, molecular gas is disrupted, leaving behind surviving dense clouds too small to give birth to new stars. Our results not only underscore the role of major galaxy mergers in triggering quasar activity, but also reveal localized negative feedback as a profound alteration of internal gas structure which likely hampers star formation.</description>

      <title>Selection of optically variable active galactic nuclei via a random forest algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A defining characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that distinguishes them from other astronomical sources is their stochastic variability, which is observable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Upcoming optical wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, are set to transform astronomy by delivering unprecedented volumes of data for time domain studies. This data influx will require the development of the expertise and methodologies necessary to manage and analyze it effectively. Aims. This project focuses on optimizing AGN selection through optical variability in wide-field surveys and aims to reduce the bias against obscured AGN. We tested a random forest (RF) algorithm trained on various feature sets to select AGN. The initial dataset consisted of 54 observations in the r-band and 25 in the g-band of the COSMOS field, captured with the VLT Survey Telescope over a 3.3-year baseline. Methods. Our analysis relies on feature sets derived separately from either band plus a set of features combining data from both bands, mostly characterizing AGN on the basis of their variability properties and obtained from their light curves. We trained multiple RF classifiers using different subsets of selected features and assessed their performance via targeted metrics. Results. Our tests provide valuable insights into the use of multiband and multivisit data for AGN identification. We compared our findings with previous studies and dedicated part of the analysis to potential enhancements in selecting obscured AGN. The expertise gained and the methodologies developed here are readily applicable to datasets from other ground- and space-based missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of interstellar ices can be studied with thermal tracers such as the vibrational modes of CO$_2$ ice that show great diversity depending on their local chemical and thermal environment. In this work we present JWST observations of the 15.2 $\mu$m bending mode, the 4.39 $\mu$m stretching mode and the 2.70 $\mu$m combination mode of $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ ice in the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126 and the low-mass protostar Per-emb 35. The 15.2 $\mu$m bending mode of both protostars shows the characteristic double peak profile that is associated with pure CO$_2$ ice and a sharp short-wavelength peak is observed at 4.38 $\mu$m in the $^{13}$CO$_2$ bands of the two sources. Furthermore, a narrow short-wavelength feature is detected at 2.69 $\mu$m in the $^{12}$CO$_2$ combination mode of Per-emb 35. We perform a consistent profile decomposition on all three vibrational modes and show that the profiles of all three bands can be reproduced with the same linear combination of CO$_2$ ice in mixtures with mostly CH$_3$OH and H$_2$O ices when the ices undergo segregation due to heating. The findings show that upon heating, CO$_2$ ice is likely segregating from mostly the water-rich ice layer and the CO$_2$-CH$_3$OH component becomes dominant in all three vibrational modes. Additionally, we find that the contribution of the different CO$_2$ components to the total absorption band is similar for both $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$. This indicates that fractionation processes must not play a significant role during the different formation epochs, H$_2$O-dominated and CO-dominated. We quantify the $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ ice column densities and derive $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$_{ice}$ = 90 $\pm$ 9 in IRAS 20126. Finally, we report the detection of the $^{13}$CO$_2$ bending mode of pure CO$_2$ ice at 15.64 $\mu$m in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35.</description>

      <title>Lomb-Scargle periodograms struggle with non-sinusoidal supermassive BH binary signatures in quasar lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14778</link>

Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems are expected to form as a consequence of galaxy mergers. At sub-parsec separations, SMBHBs are difficult to resolve, but can be identified as quasars with periodic variability. Previous periodicity searches have identified statistically significant candidates, but focused primarily on sinusoidal signals. However, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations predict that binaries produce more complex non-sinusoidal pulse shapes. Here we examine the efficacy of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP; one of the most popular tools for periodicity searches in unevenly sampled lightcurves) to detect periodicities with a saw-tooth shape mimicking results of hydrodynamical simulations. We simulate quasar lightcurves with damped random walk (DRW) variability and inject periodic signals. Our mock sample of 12,400 quasars consists either of idealised well-sampled lightcurves, or mimics the data in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) analyzed in Charisi et al, 2016. We assess the statistical significance of recovering two types of periodic signals, i.e. with sinusoidal and sawtooth pulse shapes. We find that the LSP detects 39.1% and 28.1% of the sinusoidal signals, in the PTF-like and idealised lightcurves, respectively. The fraction is significantly reduced for sawtooth periodicity, with only 7.5% and 1.1% detected in PTF-like and idealised lightcurves, respectively. These low recovery rates imply that previous searches have missed the large majority of binaries. Therefore, significant improvements are required beyond simple LSPs to successfully uncover SMBHBs in upcoming time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Accretion of self-interacting dark matter onto supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) spikes around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may lead to interesting physical effects such as enhanced DM annihilation signals or dynamical friction within binary systems, shortening the merger time and possibly addressing the `final parsec problem'. They can also be promising places to study the collisionality of DM because their velocity dispersion is higher than in DM halos allowing us to probe a different velocity regime. We aim to understand the evolution of isolated DM spikes for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and compute the BH accretion rate as a function of the self-interaction cross-section per unit DM mass ($\sigma/m_\chi$). We have performed the first $N$-body simulations of SIDM spikes around supermassive black holes (SMBH) and studied the evolution of the spike with an isolated BH starting from profiles similar to the ones that have been shown to be stable in analytical calculations. We find that the analytical profiles for SIDM spikes remain stable over the time-scales of hundreds of years that we have covered with our simulations. In the long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, the accretion rate onto the BHs grows linearly with the cross-section and flattens when we move towards the short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime. In both regimes, our simulations match analytic expectations, which are based on the heat conduction description of SIDM. A simple model for the accretion rate allows us to calibrate the heat conduction in the gravothermal fluid prescription of SIDM. Using this prescription, we determine the maximum allowed accretion rate which occurs when $r_{\rm isco} \rho(r_{\rm isco}) \sigma/m_\chi \sim 1$, where $r_{\rm isco}$ the radius of the innermost stable orbit. Our calibrated DM accretion rates could be used for statistical analysis of SMBH growth and incorporated into subgrid models to study BH growth in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Stellar and Interstellar Contributions to Polarization: Modeling Approaches for Hot Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear polarimetry of unresolved stars is a powerful method for discerning or constraining the geometry of a source and its environment, since spherical sources produce no net polarization. However, a general challenge to interpreting intrinsic stellar polarization is the contribution to the signal by interstellar polarization (ISP). Here, we review methodologies for distinguishing the stellar signal from the interstellar contribution in the context of massive stars. We first characterize ISP with distance using a recent compilation of starlight polarization catalogs. Several scenarios involving Thomson scattering, rapidly rotating stars, optically thick winds, and interacting binaries are considered specifically to contrast the wavelength-dependent effects of ISP in the ultraviolet versus optical bands. ISP is recognizable in the stellar polarization from Thomson scattering in the polarization position angle rotations. For hot stars with near-critical rotation rates, the ISP declines whereas the stellar continuum polarization sharply increases. In the case of quite dense winds, strong ultraviolet lines trace the ISP, which is not always the case in the optical. In the binary case, temporal and chromatic effects illustrate how the ISP displaces variable polarization with wavelength. This study clarifies the impacts of ISP in relation to new ultraviolet spectropolarimetry efforts such as Polstar and Pollux.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Measuring intrinsic galaxy alignments in deep wide fields as a function of colour, luminosity, stellar mass and redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the measurements and constraints of intrinsic alignments (IA) in the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) deep wide fields, which include the W1 and W3 fields from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) and the G09 field from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). Our analyses cover 51deg$^{2}$, in the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) range $0.1 &lt; z_{\mathrm{b}} &lt; 1$ and a magnitude limit $i_{\mathrm{AB}}&lt;22$. The precise photo-$z$s and the luminosity coverage of PAUS enable robust IA measurements, which are key for setting informative priors for upcoming stage-IV surveys. For red galaxies, we detect an increase in IA amplitude with both luminosity and stellar mass, extending previous results towards fainter and less massive regimes. As a function of redshift, we observe strong IA signals at intermediate ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.55$) and high ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.75$) redshift bins. However, we find no significant trend of IA evolution with redshift after accounting for the varying luminosities across redshift bins, consistent with the literature. For blue galaxies, no significant IA signal is detected, with $A_{1}=0.68_{-0.51}^{+0.53}$ when splitting only by galaxy colour, yielding some of the tightest constraints to date for the blue population and constraining a regime of very faint and low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a spectroscopic study of 39 blue straggler stars in the globular cluster NGC 3201. The spectra of these stars were collected from the literature. We determined the radial velocity, atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g), and the abundance of Mg, as well as the metallicity ([Fe/H]) of the blue straggler population. The mean radial velocity and [Fe/H] are determined to be 498.0 $\pm$ 5.3 km/s and -1.42 $\pm$ 0.27, respectively, for the blue straggler stars. The derived [Fe/H] is consistent, within uncertainties, with the cluster's [Fe/H] of -1.59 dex. The mean [Mg/Fe] for the blue straggler stars is estimated to be 0.36 $\pm$ 0.73. Importantly, this study first estimates [Mg/Fe] for the blue straggler stars in the cluster NGC 3201.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) deep imaging of the field around the Seyfert galaxy IC~4329A based on five observations performed with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT), onboard AstroSat. The long exposures of 82.9 ks in NUV (N245M; $\lambda_{mean}=2447$\r{A} ; $\Delta\lambda = 270$\r{A}) and 92.2~ks in FUV (F154W; $\lambda_{mean} = 1541$\r{A}; $\Delta\lambda=380$\r{A}) bands constitute the deepest observations with $5\sigma$ detection limits of AB magnitudes $m_{NUV}= 26.2$ and $m_{FUV} = 25.7$. Leveraging UVIT's excellent angular resolution (FWHM $\sim 1.2-1.8^{\prime \prime}$), we performed a detailed analysis of the IC~4329A field and detected (above 5$\sigma$ significance level) a total of 4437 and 456 sources in the NUV and FUV bands, respectively. A large number of these detected sources were unknown previously. We performed astrometry and photometry on all detected sources. By cross-matching our catalogue with Gaia-DR3 and XMM-Newton DR12 catalogues, we found 651 optical and 97 X-ray counterparts of our sources. Additionally, we explored UV variability of point sources, identifying 28 NUV sources as variable with a significance above the $2.5\sigma$ level. Of these, only three sources exhibited variability in the FUV band. Utilising the NUV and Gaia fluxes, we determined that two previously catalogued white dwarf candidates are misclassified. Furthermore, we highlight galaxies with atypical morphology, including ring-like structures, multiple compact central sources, bifurcating spiral arms, etc. Follow-up optical spectroscopy and multi-wavelength observations are imperative to further investigate the nature of the sources within this field.</description>

      <title>CMB Lensing Trispectrum as a Probe of Parity Violation in LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing trispectrum is sensitive to parity violation in Large-Scale Structure (LSS). We obtain a compact expression for the reduced lensing trispectrum that is general for any input matter trispectrum. We then present as an example a simple parity-violating toy model for the latter, and explicitly compute the parity-odd lensing trispectrum, including an estimate of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). This work serves as a proof of principle, demonstrating how future studies of more physically motivated models can be conducted. It also provides an intuitive physical explanation of why CMB lensing is sensitive to parity. Our work is the first to point out that secondary CMB anisotropies can be used to probe parity in LSS, and will be important in enabling upcoming experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 to contribute maximal power on parity violation.</description>

      <title>The power spectrum of galaxies from large to small scales: a line-intensity mapping perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model for the power spectrum of the density field of galaxies weighted by their star formation rate. This weighting is relevant in line-intensity mapping (LIM) when the observed line luminosity is strongly correlated with star formation, as is the case for the H$\alpha$ line. Our model reproduces the measured power spectrum in the IllustrisTNG simulation to within a few per cent across all scales, with fitting parameters that have clear physical interpretations. On scales of tens of megaparsecs, the model accounts for the weighted non-linear bias of galaxies as well as halo exclusion (2-halo term). On smaller scales, it incorporates the weighted distribution of satellite galaxies within haloes (1-halo term). The random sampling of satellite galaxies introduces a galaxy shot noise term to the power spectrum on small scales, and their confinement to haloes introduces a halo shot noise term on large scales. Omitting satellite galaxies from the analysis results in an underestimation of both the large-scale bias and the mean intensity by approximately 30 per cent each at redshift 1.5. Assigning the intensity of satellites to the centre of their respective haloes affects the power spectrum on scales $k &gt; 0.3$ h Mpc$^{-1}$. Our fitting function provides a well-motivated parametrisation that can be used to interpret data from upcoming LIM surveys.</description>

      <title>Compact dust-obscured star-formation and the origin of the galaxy bimodality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the last decade, studies about highly attenuated and massive red star-forming galaxies (RedSFGs) at $z \sim 4$ have suggested that they could constitute a crucial population for unraveling the mechanisms driving the transition from vigorous star formation to quiescence at high redshifts. Since such a transition seems to be linked to a morphological transformation, studying the morphological properties of these RedSFGs is essential to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we are using JWST/NIRCam images from the CEERS survey to assemble a mass-complete sample of 188 massive galaxies at $z=3-4$, for which we perform resolved-SED fit. After classifying galaxies into typical blue SFGs (BlueSFGs), RedSFGs and quiescent galaxies (QGs), we compare the morphologies of each population in terms of stellar mass density, SFR density, sSFR, dust-attenuation and mass-weighted age. We find that RedSFGs and QGs present similar stellar surface density profiles and that RedSFGs manifest a dust attenuation concentration significantly higher than that of BlueSFGs at all masses. This indicates that to become quiescent, a BlueSFG must transit through a major compaction phase once it has become sufficiently massive. At the same time, we find RedSFGs and QGs to account for more than $50\%$ of galaxies with ${\rm log}(M_\ast/M_\odot)&gt; 10.4$ at this redshift. This transition mass corresponds to the "critical mass" delineating the bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs in the local Universe. We then conclude that there is a bimodality between extended BlueSFGs and compact, highly attenuated RedSFGs that have undergone a major gas compaction phase enabling the latter to build a massive bulb in situ. There is evidence that this early-stage separation is at the origin of the local bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs, which we refer to as a "primeval bimodality".</description>

      <title>A statistical study of Lopsided Galaxies using Random Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lopsided galaxies are late-type galaxies with a non-axisymmetric disc due to an uneven distribution of their stellar mass. Despite being a relatively common perturbation, several questions regarding its origin and the information that can be extracted from them about the evolutionary history of late-type galaxies. The advent of several large multi-band photometric surveys will allow us to statistically analyze this perturbation, with information that was not previously available. Given the strong correlation between lopsidedness and the structural properties of the galaxies, this paper aims to develop a method to automatically classify late-type galaxies between lopsided and symmetric. We seek to explore if an accurate classification can be obtain by only considering their internal properties, without additional information about the environment. We select 8000 late-type galaxies from TNG50. A Fourier decomposition of their stellar mass surface density is used to label galaxies as lopsided and symmetric. We trained a Random Forest classifier to rapidly and automatically identify this type of perturbations, exclusively using galaxies internal properties. We test different algorithms to deal with the imbalance of our data and select the most suitable approach based on the considered metrics. We show that our trained algorithm can provide a very accurate and rapid classification of lopsided galaxies. The excellent results obtained by our classifier strongly supports the hypothesis that lopsidedness is mainly a tracer of galaxies internal structures. We show that similar results can be obtained using observable quantities, readily obtainable from multi-bad photometric surveys. Our results show it allows a rapid and accurate classification of lopsided galaxies, allowing us to explore whether lopsidedness in present-day disc galaxies is connected to galaxies specific evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>commensurability: a Python package for classifying astronomical orbits based on their toroid volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a star orbits the center of its host galaxy, the trajectory is encompassed within a 3D toroid. The orbit probes all points in this toroid, unless its orbital frequencies exhibit integer ratios (commensurate frequencies), in which case a small sub-volume is traversed. commensurability is a Python package that implements a tessellation-based algorithm for identifying orbital families that satisfy commensurabilities by measuring the toroid volume traversed over orbit integration. Compared to standard orbit classification methods such as frequency analysis, tessellation analysis relies on configuration space properties alone, making classification results more robust to frequency instabilities or limited integration times. The package provides a framework for analyzing phase-space coordinates using tessellation analysis, including a subpackage for the implementation of the general tessellation algorithm. The package is to be used with a galactic dynamics library; it currently supports AGAMA, gala, and galpy.</description>

Abstract: Deep imaging surveys have changed our view of the low surface brightness (LSB) Universe. The "renaissance" of the low surface brightness dwarf galaxy population, as the prime example of such recent development, continues to challenge our understanding of galaxy formation. Here, We report the serendipitous discovery of Zangetsu, an isolated, quiescent, and distorted ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidate in the COSMOS field, using images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Zangetsu exhibits an extremely low central surface brightness ($\mathrm{\mu_{0,g}}=26.60\pm0.01$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$), a very shallow inner surface brightness profile ($\mathrm{n}_{\rm Sersic}=0.40\pm0.01$), and a large angular size ($\mathrm{R_e}\approx 10.44$ arcsec). Surprisingly, Zangetsu also has a quiescent stellar population ($\mathrm{g-i}=0.96$), an unusually elongated shape ($\mathrm{b/a}\sim 0.25$), and mild morphological asymmetry, making it a rare case among known UDGs. Surface brightness fluctuation analysis of HSC and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images only provides a distance lower limit of $D&gt;25.4$ Mpc (thus $\mathrm{R_e}&gt;1.38$ kpc). However, Zangetsu remains an extreme outlier in the luminosity-size relation of known LSB galaxies, suggesting that it could be an exceptionally large and/or diffuse system. Classic internal or external UDG formation mechanisms alone struggle to explain such a system. A backsplash origin may account for its isolation and quiescent nature. This finding also raises the possibility that current works may overlook similarly extreme, elongated systems that could further our understanding of the LSB Universe.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Millisecond Pulsar Gamma-Ray Luminosity Function and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>

Abstract: It has been suggested that the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess (GCE) could be produced by a large number of centrally-located millisecond pulsars. The fact that no such pulsar population has been detected implies that these sources must be very faint and very numerous. In this study, we use the contents of Fermi's recently released Third Pulsar Catalog (3PC) to measure the luminosity function of the millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's Disk. We find that this source population exhibits a luminosity function with a mean gamma-ray luminosity of $\langle L_\gamma \rangle \sim 6 \times 10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg/s}$ (integrated above 0.1 GeV). If the GCE were generated by millisecond pulsars with the same luminosity function, we find that $\sim 20$ such sources from the Inner Galaxy population should have already been detected by Fermi and included in the 3PC. Given the lack of such observed sources, we exclude the hypothesis that the GCE is generated by pulsars with the same luminosity function as those in the Galactic Disk with a significance of $3.4\sigma$. We conclude that either less than 39\% of the GCE is generated by pulsars, or that the millisecond pulsars in the Inner Galaxy are at least 5 times less luminous on average than those found in the Galactic Disk.</description>

      <title>On the contributions of extragalactic CO emission lines to ground-based CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of CO rotational lines at redshifts $z\sim 0-6$ being an appreciable source of extragalactic foreground anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. Motivated by previous investigations, we specifically focus on the frequency bands and small scales probed by ground-based surveys. Using an empirical parameterization for the relation between the infrared luminosity of galaxies and their CO line luminosity, conditioned on sub-mm observations of CO luminosity functions from $J=1$ to $J=7$ at $\nu = \{100,250\}$ GHz, we explore how uncertainty in the CO luminosity function translates into uncertainty in the signature of CO emission in the CMB. We find that at $\ell = 3000$ the amplitude of the CO cross-correlation with the CIB could be detectable in an ACT-like experiment with 90, 150 and 220 GHz bands, even in the scenarios with the lowest amplitude consistent with sub-mm data. We also investigate, for the first time, the amplitude of the CO$\times$CIB correlation between different frequency bands and find that our model predicts that this signal could be the second-largest extragalactic foreground at certain wavelengths, behind the CIB cross-frequency spectrum. This implies current observations can potentially be used to constrain the bright end of CO luminosity functions, which are difficult to probe with current sub-mm telescopes due to the small volumes they survey. Our findings corroborate past results and have significant implications in template-based searches for CMB secondaries, such as the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, using the frequency-dependent high-$\ell$ TT power spectrum.</description>

      <title>How to use Gaia parallaxes for stars with poor astrometric fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry, we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically, and sources blended with neighboring sources.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective optimization for scattering mitigation and scattering screen reconstruction in VLBI observations of the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging reconstruction of interferometric data is a hard ill-posed inverse problem. Its difficulty is increased when observing the Galactic Center, which is obscured by a scattering screen. This is because the scattering breaks the one-to-one correspondence between images and visibilities. Solving the scattering problem is one of the biggest challenges in radio imaging of the Galactic Center. In this work we present a novel strategy to mitigate its effect and constrain the screen itself using multiobjective optimization. We exploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to describe the optimization landscape to recover the intrinsic source structure and the scattering screen affecting the data. We successfully recover both the screen and the source in a wide range of simulated cases, including the speed of a moving screen at 230 GHz. Particularly, we can recover a ring structure in scattered data at 86 GHz. Our analysis demonstrates the huge potential that recent advancements in imaging and optimization algorithms offer to recover image structures, even in weakly constrained and degenerated, possibly multi-modal settings. The successful reconstruction of the scattering screen opens the window to event horizon scale works on the Galactic Center at 86G Hz up to 116 GHz, and the study of the scattering screen itself.</description>
