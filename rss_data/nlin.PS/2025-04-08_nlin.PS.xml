      <title>Oscillator Chain Model for Multi-Contour Systems With Priority in Conflict Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model of oscillatory chains that generalizes the contour discrete model of Buslaev nets. The model offers a continuous description of conflicts in system dynamics, interpreted as interactions between neighboring oscillators when their phases lie within defined interaction sectors. The size of the interaction sector can be seen as a measure of vehicle density within clusters moving along contours. The model assumes that oscillators can synchronize their dynamics, using concepts inherited from the Kuramoto model, which effectively accounts for the discrete state effects observed in Buslaev nets. The governing equation for oscillator dynamics incorporates four key factors: deceleration caused by conflicts with neighboring oscillators and the synchronization process, which induces additional acceleration or deceleration. Numerical analysis shows that the system exhibits both familiar properties from classic Buslaev nets, such as metastable synchronization, and novel behaviors, including phase transitions as the interaction sector size changes.</description>

      <title>Parametrically driven Kerr temporal soliton crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the excitation, dynamics of parametrically driven soliton crystals and their resulting frequency combs in doubly resonant cavities with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. We demonstrate that soliton crystal states act as strong attractors, where pump depletion and pump phase play crucial roles in their stabilization by ensuring equal soliton spacing and coherence. The number of solitons is primarily determined by driving strength. Additionally, we identify a novel nonlinear state in parametric soliton crystals in which circulating solitons periodically alternate their intensities and group velocities, a phenomenon we term the soliton-pursuing states. Furthermore, due to the phase-selective nature of the optical parametric process, we show how different configurations of soliton phases influence the optical frequency combs, which may enable generating odd harmonic combs.</description>

      <title>Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline states in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.</description>

      <title>Intensity Correlation Measurement to Simulate Two-body BICs and Probe Nonlinear Discrete Breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Hanbury Brown-Twiss spatial intensity correlations in femtosecond laser-fabricated photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices using coherent input states with tunable phases. By mapping intensity correlations to the two-body quantum walk, we experimentally simulate edge bound states in the continuum (BICs) of two indistinguishable bosons. These two-body edge BICs show remarkable robustness in the presence of disorder. We then discuss how intensity correlations can capture the dynamics of two identical fermions for which BICs do not exist on the same edge of the lattice. The localization of intensity correlation, observed in the linear regime, persists at weak nonlinearity due to the formation of long-lived edge breathers -- spatially localized nonlinear states with oscillating intensity along the propagation distance. For stronger nonlinearities, localized edge states are not formed for a range of phases, destroying the localization of the intensity correlation. Our results highlight the interplay of band structure, initial state, and nonlinearity influencing transport and intensity correlations.</description>

      <title>Energy Scalability Limits of Dissipative Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we apply a thermodynamical approach to elucidate the primary constraints on the energy scaling of dissipative solitons (DS). We rely on the adiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling in terms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentally verifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: i) growth of a Lorentzian spike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectral condensation in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), ii) saturation of the spectrum broadening, and iii) asymptotical DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakup with three critical factors: i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherent in strongly chirped DS, ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, which provokes its disintegration, and iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase, which is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiple stable DSs with lower energy. Theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr$^{2+}$:ZnS chirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energy femtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiber lasers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</description>
