      <title>Supergeometric Approach to Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a recently proposed SuperGeometric (SG) approach to Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) that allow for scalar-fermion field transformations in a manifestly reparameterisation covariant manner. By adopting natural choices for the field-space supermetric, we show how a non-trivial field-space Riemannian curvature can be introduced in the fermionic sector, beyond the usual one that may have its origin in the scalar part of the theory. We present a minimal SG-QFT model with proper non-zero fermionic curvature both in two and four spacetime dimensions. Possible future directions in further developing SG-QFTs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Open-Closed String Duality, Branes, and Topological Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider matrix models exhibiting open-closed string duality in two-dimensional string theories with various amounts of supersymmetry. In particular, a relationship between matrix models in the $\beta = 2$ Wigner-Dyson class and models in the $(1 + 2\Gamma, 2)$ Altland-Zirnbauer class relates the perturbative solutions of the two systems' string equations. Point-like operator insertions in the closed string theory are mapped to the topological expansion of the free energy in the open string theory. We compute correlation functions of macroscopic loop operators and FZZT branes in a general topological gravity background. The relationship between the topological recursion of moduli space volumes and branes is discussed by analyzing the Virasoro conditions in the matrix models.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect of a rough membrane in an Aether-like Lorentz-violating scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Casimir effect of a rough membrane within the framework of theories that break Lorentz symmetry. We consider two constant Aether vectors: one timelike and other spacelike, simultaneously. We employ an appropriate change of coordinates such that the membrane assumes a completely flat border and the remaining terms associated with the roughness are considered as part of the potential. Quantum fluctuations are induced by a scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spectrum is obtained through perturbation theory and regularized using the $\zeta$--function method. We provide an explicit example of a membrane with periodic boundaries. The presence of Aether vectors has a significant impact on the dominant term of the Casimir effect, while roughness only affects the secondary terms. Additionally, we examine the finite-temperature case.</description>

      <title>Solving the Spectral Problem via the Periodic Boundary Approximation in $\phi^6$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $\phi^6$ theory, the resonance scattering structure is triggered by the so-calls delocalized modes trapped between the $\bar{K}K$ pair. The frequencies and configurations of such modes depend on the $\bar{K}K$ half-separation 2$a$, can be derived from the Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation. We propose to use the periodic boundary conditions to connect the localized and delocalized modes, and use periodic boundary approximation (PBA) to solve the spectrum analytically. In detail, we derive the explicit form of frequencies, configurations and spectral wall locations of the delocalized modes. We test the analytical prediction with the numerical simulation of the Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation, and obtain astonishing agreement between them at the long separation regime.</description>

      <title>Physical aspects of the deformation of $\mathds{Z}_2$ kinks in a generalized $\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in a generalized $\phi^4$ model the formation of BPS kink/antikink configurations with compacton-like profiles. One observes that the positive parameter controlling the generalizing function promotes an infinity degenerescence of the BPS solutions. Furthermore, the analysis of the excitation spectrum of the model shows that for values of the generalizing parameter closest to zero, there are both translational and vibrational modes. On the other hand, for sufficiently large values of the generalizing parameter, one does not observe the zero mode, and only vibrational modes emerge. Thus, the emergence of bound states of solitons (bions) and resonance phenomena is guaranteed when analyzing the scattering of kink/antikink structures. In this way, one notes that depending on the initial velocity, the collision can be inelastic or quasi-elastic, even in the case of compacton-like configurations. Finally, we apply the Differential Configurational Complexity technique to obtain the parameter values providing the most likely field profiles.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entanglement Capacity of de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near horizons, quantum fields of low spin exhibit densities of states that behave asymptotically like 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories. In effective field theory, imposing some short-distance cutoff, one can compute thermodynamic quantities associated with the horizon, and the leading cutoff sensitivity of the heat capacity is found to equal to the leading cutoff sensitivity of the entropy. One can also compute contributions to the thermodynamic quantities from the gravitational path integral. For the cosmological horizon of the static patch of de Sitter space, a natural conjecture for the relevant heat capacity is shown to equal the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These observations allow us to extend the well-known notion of the generalized entropy to a generalized heat capacity for the static patch of dS. The finiteness of the entropy and the nonvanishing of the generalized heat capacity suggests it is useful to think about dS as a state in a finite dimensional quantum gravity model that is not maximally uncertain.</description>

Abstract: We use the Kantor-Susskind\cite{kantsuss} model of fermions as "dumbbells" connecting points on a cubic lattice to points on its dual, to define a duality between local fermionic models invariant under a $Z_2$ gauge symmetry and models of bosonic variables (generalizations of Pauli matrices) defined on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Decay of Kaluza-Klein Vacuum via Singular Instanton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the decay process of metastable vacua in quantum field theories, the bounce solution, a classical solution in Euclideanized theories, is helpful in calculating the decay rate. Recently, the bounce solution with a conical singularity has attracted wide attention and revealed physical importance. In this paper, we discuss the bubble of nothing solution, which describes the decay process of a five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein vacuum, and study the consequence of including conical singularity. We found that the bounce solution with singularities has a higher decay rate than those without. This effect suggests that a singular solution can play a dominant role in vacuum decay of theories with compact internal space. We also discuss the enhanced decay rate from a thermodynamic perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum long-range models at zero temperature can be described by fractional Lifshitz field theories, that is, anisotropic models whose actions are short-range in time and long-range in space. In this paper we study the renormalization of fractional Lifshitz field theories with weakly relevant cubic or quartic self-interactions. Their nontrivial infrared fixed points exhibit Lifshitz scale invariance, and we compute the lowest-order corrections to the dynamic critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Supergravity in the Geometric Approach and its Hidden Graded Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present the geometric approach to supergravity. In the first part, we discuss in some detail the peculiarities of the approach and apply the formalism to the case of pure supergravity in four space-time dimensions. In the second part, we extend the discussion to theories in higher dimensions, which include antisymmetric tensors of degree higher than one, focussing on the case of eleven dimensional space-time. Here, we report the formulation first introduced in 1981 by R. D'Auria and P. Fr\`e, corresponding to a generalization of a Chevalley-Eilenberg Lie algebra, together with some more recent results, pointing out the relation of the formalism with the mathematical framework of $L_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <title>Defining the type IIB matrix model without breaking Lorentz symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory, which may elucidate the emergence of (3+1)-dimensional space-time. However, the partition function is divergent due to the Lorentz symmetry, which is represented by a noncompact group. This divergence has been regularized conventionally by introducing some infrared cutoff, which breaks the Lorentz symmetry. Here we point out that Lorentz invariant observables become classical as one removes the infrared cutoff and that this "classicalization" is actually an artifact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking cutoff. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a natural way to "gauge-fix" the Lorentz symmetry in a fully nonperturbative manner. This also enables us to perform numerical simulations in such a way that the time-evolution can be extracted directly from the matrix configurations.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Lagrangian Formulation for Bosonic Continuous Spin Theory in Flat Spacetime of Arbitrary Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have discovered two unconstrained forms of free Lagrangian for continuous spin(CS) theory in arbitrary flat spacetime dimension for bosonic case. These Lagrangians, unlike that by Schuster and Toro, do not include delta functions and are conventional. The first form consists of five kinds of totally symmetric helicity fields and one kind of gauge parameter. By introducing auxiliary creation and annihilation operators, each is combined into a state vector in Fock space, including all ranks one by one. The Lagrangian imposes no constraints, such as trace conditions, on these fields or the gauge parameter field. Additionally, the Lagrangian does not contain higher-order derivative terms. In the limit as CS parameter $\mu$ approaches zero, it naturally reproduces a Lagrangian for helicity fields in higher spin(HS) theory, known as unconstrained quartet formulation. Permitting third-order derivatives, we also obtain the second unconstrained form of Lagrangian that can be written in terms of three kinds of fields, including $\mu$, similar to the formulation by Francia and Sagnotti. Partial gauge fixing and partial use of equation of motion(EOM) on this Lagrangian yield a Fronsdal-like Lagrangian with a single double-traceless field, including $\mu$. By imposing further gauge fixing on the field in the EOM with respect to divergence and trace, we confirm the reproduction of the modified Wigner equations already known in literature.</description>

      <title>Brane mechanics and gapped Lie n-algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We draw a parallel between the BV/BRST formalism for higher-dimensional ($\ge 2$) Hamiltonian mechanics and higher notions of torsion and basic curvature tensors for generalized connections in specific Lie $n$-algebroids based on homotopy Poisson structures. The gauge systems we consider include Poisson sigma models in any dimension and ``generalised R-flux'' deformations thereof, such as models with an $(n+2)$-form-twisted R-Poisson target space. Their BV/BRST action includes interaction terms among the fields, ghosts and antifields whose coefficients acquire a geometric meaning by considering twisted Koszul multibrackets that endow the target space with a structure that we call a gapped almost Lie $n$-algebroid. Studying covariant derivatives along $n$-forms, we define suitable polytorsion and basic polycurvature tensors and identify them with the interaction coefficients in the gauge theory, thus relating models for topological $n$-branes to differential geometry on Lie $n$-algebroids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore superoscillations within the context of classical and quantum field theories, presenting novel solutions to Klein-Gordon's, Dirac's, Maxwell's and Einstein's equations. In particular, we illustrate a procedure of second quantization of fields and how to construct a Fock space which encompasses Superoscillating states. Furthermore, we extend the application of superoscillations to quantum tunnelings, scatterings and mixings of particles, squeezed states and potential advancements in laser interferometry, which could open new avenues for experimental tests of Quantum Gravity effects. By delving into the relationship among superoscillations and phenomena such as Hawking radiation, the Black Hole (BH) information and the Firewall paradox, we propose an alternative mechanism for information transfer across the BH event horizon.</description>

      <title>Twisted holography on AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times K3$ &amp; the planar chiral algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit and elaborate on twisted holography for AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times X$ with $X= T^4$, K3, with a particular focus on K3. We describe the twist of supergravity, identify the corresponding (generalization of) BCOV theory, and enumerate twisted supergravity states. We use this knowledge, and the technique of Koszul duality, to obtain the $N \rightarrow \infty$, or planar, limit of the chiral algebra of the dual CFT. The resulting symmetries are strong enough to fix planar 2 and 3-point functions in the twisted theory or, equivalently, in a 1/4-BPS subsector of the original duality. This technique can in principle be used to compute corrections to the chiral algebra perturbatively in $1/N$.</description>

      <title>Spatially regular charged black holes supporting charged massive scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, as opposed to the familiar charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black-hole spacetime, the spatially regular charged Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) black-hole spacetime can support charged scalar clouds, spatially regular stationary matter configurations which are made of linearized charged massive scalar fields. Interestingly, we reveal the fact that the composed black-hole-field system is amenable to an analytical treatment in the regime $Q/M\ll1\ll M\mu$ of weakly charged black holes and large-mass fields, in which case it is proved that the dimensionless physical parameter $\alpha\equiv{{qQ}\over{M\mu}}$ must lie in the narrow interval $\alpha\in\big(\sqrt{{{3240}\over{6859}}},{{16}\over{23}}\big)$ [here $\{M,Q\}$ are the mass and electric charge of the central black hole and $\{\mu,q\}$ are the proper mass and charge coupling constant of the supported scalar field]. In particular, we explicitly prove that, for weakly charged black holes, the discrete resonance spectrum $\{\alpha(M,Q,\mu,q;n\}^{n=\infty}_{n=0}$ of the composed charged-ABG-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field cloudy configurations can be determined {\it analytically} in the eikonal large-mass regime.</description>

      <title>Measurable Krylov Spaces and Eigenenergy Count in Quantum State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new Krylov space for the time evolution of a quantum state, which is both quantum-mechanically measurable. Based on our defined spaces, an effective dimension is introduced that provides insight into how expressive the quantum system is. The understanding of the time evolution operator as a map onto a Krylov space is evident from the Taylor expansion of said operator. Current literature focuses on computing different powers of the Hamiltonian to construct a basis for the Krylov state space. One challenge this approach faces is that computing higher powers of the Hamiltonian becomes increasingly difficult for larger systems. Since each basis state is constructed from a different power of the Hamiltonian, the basis states have varying lengths, making the ortho-normalization process challenging. Furthermore, computing high powers of the Hamiltonian increases rounding errors, which can lead to a wrongly increased Krylov space dimension. The first part of our work challenges these issues by defining an equivalent space, where the original basis consists of states of the same length. We demonstrate that a set of different time-evolved states can be used to construct a basis. We subsequently verify the results through numerical analysis, demonstrating that every time-evolved state can be reconstructed using the defined vector space. Based on this new space, we define an effective dimension and analyze its influence on finite-dimensional systems. Our method gives insight into the basis construction of the time evolution operator, which can be computed experimentally. We further show that the Krylov space dimension is equal to the number of pairwise distinct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, enabling a method to determine the number of eigenenergies the system has experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase of discrepancy in the standard procedure to choose the arbitrary functional form of the Lagrangian $f(Q)$ motivates us to solve this issue in modified theories of gravity. In this regard, we investigate the Gaussian process (GP), which allows us to eliminate this issue in a $f(Q)$ model-independent way. In particular, we use the 57 Hubble measurements coming from cosmic chronometers and the radial Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) to reconstruct $H(z)$ and its derivatives $H'(z)$, $H''(z)$, which resulting lead us to reconstruct region of $f(Q)$, without any assumptions. The obtained mean curve along $\Lambda$CDM constant in the reconstructed region follows a quadratic behavior. This motivates us to propose a new $f(Q)$ parametrization, i.e., $f(Q)= -2\Lambda+ \epsilon Q^2$, with the single parameter $\epsilon$, which signifies the deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Further, we probe the widely studied power-law and exponential $f(Q)$ models against the reconstructed region and can improve the parameter spaces significantly compared with observational analysis. In addition, the direct Hubble measurements, along with the reconstructed $f(Q)$ function, allow the $H_0$ tension to be alleviated.</description>

      <title>A Multiverse Outside of the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Multiverse can arise from landscapes without de Sitter minima. It can be populated during a period of eternal inflation without trans-Planckian field excursions and without flat potentials. This Multiverse can explain the values of the cosmological constant and of the weak scale. In the process of proving these statements we derive a few simple, but counter-intuitive results. We show that it is easy to write models of eternal inflation compatible with the distance and refined de Sitter conjectures. Secondly, tunneling transitions that move fields from a lower-energy vacuum to a higher-energy vacuum and generate baby Universes are possible, and occur during eternal inflation. Finally, we relax the assumption of no de Sitter minima and show that this more standard Multiverse can be populated by Coleman-De Luccia transitions in about 100 $e$-folds of inflation.</description>

      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high frequency gravitational waves from cosmic strings with friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We include the effect of the frictional force caused by interactions between cosmic strings and the particles of the background plasma in the computation of the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by cosmic string loops. Although our results show that friction leads to a partial suppression of the emission of gravitational radiation by cosmic string loops, we also find that loop production is very intense in the early stages of the Kibble regime. We show that, in many instances, this leads to a prominent signature of friction in the ultra-high frequency range of the spectrum, in the form of a secondary peak. The signature of friction is not only sensitive to cosmic string properties, but also to the initial conditions of the network and its surroundings. A detection of this signature would then allow us to extract information about the physics of the early universe that cannot be uncovered when probing the rest of the stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum.</description>

      <title>String-based parametrization of nucleon GPDs at any skewness: a comparison to lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) effective across all skewness values. The conformal moments of the GPDs are expressed as sums of the spin-j nucleon A-form factor, and the skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor. This representation, which fulfills the polynomiality condition and does not rely on model-specific assumptions, is derived from t-channel string exchanges in AdS spaces. The spin-j nucleon D-form factor is closely related to the the spin-j nucleon A-form factor. We use the Mellin moments from empirical parton distributions to model the spin-j nucleon A-form factors. Using only five Regge slope parameters, fixed from the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, our string-based parametrization generates accurate singlet, non-singlet, isovector, and flavor-separated nucleon quark GPDs, along with symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs from their Mellin-Barnes integral representations. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data. Our string-based parametrization should enhance the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, bypassing the de-convolution problem.</description>

      <title>The Spacetime Penrose Inequality for Cohomogeneity One Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the spacetime Penrose inequality for asymptotically flat $2(n+1)$-dimensional initial data sets for the Einstein equations, which are invariant under a cohomogeneity one action of $\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$. Analogous results are obtained for asymptotically hyperbolic initial data that arise as spatial hypersurfaces in asymptotically Anti de-Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, it is shown that with the dominant energy condition, the total mass is bounded below by an explicit function of the outermost apparent horizon area. Furthermore, the inequality is saturated if and only if the initial data isometrically embed into a Schwarzschild(-AdS) spacetime. This generalizes the only previously known case of the conjectured spacetime Penrose inequality, established under the assumption of spherical symmetry. Additionally, in the time symmetric case, we observe that the inequality holds for $4(n+1)$-dimensional and 16-dimensional initial data invariant under cohomogeneity one actions of $\mathrm{Sp}(n+1)$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(9)$, respectively, thus treating the inequality for all cohomogeneity one actions in this regime.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simmons electrodynamics and torsion dark matter axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the influence of torsion axial pseudo vector on dark photons in an axion torsionic background, as investigated previously by Duncan et al[ Nucl Phys B 387:215 (1992)]. Notably, axial torsion, owing to its significantly greater mass compared to axions, gives rise to magnetic helicity in torsionful Chern-Simons (CS) electrodynamics, leading to the damping of magnetic fields. In QCD scale the damping from dark massive photons leads us to obtain a magnetic field of $10^{-8}$ Gauss, which is approximated the order of magnitude of magnetic fields at present universe. This result is obtained by considering that torsion has the value of the 1 MeV at the early universe, and can be improved to the higher value of $10^{-3}$ Gauss when the axial torsion 0-component is given by $10^{8}$ MeV and the mass of dark photon is approximated equal to the axion. The axion plays a crucial role in achieving CS dynamo action arising from axions. This study is useful in deepening our understanding of fundamental physics, from nuclear interactions to the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Basis Light-Front Quantization framework, we systematically investigate the subleading twist (twist-3) transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) of the proton beyond the Wandzura-Wilczek (WW) approximation. The subleading twist TMDs are not independent and can be decomposed into twist-2 and genuine twist-3 terms from the equations of motion. The latter involves quark-quark-gluon correlations and contains interferences between two light-front Fock sectors, $|qqq\rangle$ and $|qqqg\rangle$, which are usually neglected in the WW approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>The Self-Consistency of DESI Analysis and Comment on "Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the constraints on the evolution of dark energy implemented by the DESI collaboration may be insufficient or incomplete using their own BAO data. Using large enough prior ranges for the present-day equation of state of dark energy $\omega_0$ and amplitude of dark energy evolution $\omega_a$, we obtain the complete $1\,\sigma$ and $2\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=1.04^{+0.91+2.00}_{-1.00-1.90}$ and $\omega_a=-7.4^{+3.8+6.8}_{-3.2-7.3}$ indicating a beyond $2\,\sigma$ preference of quintessence-like dark energy today and an evidence of evolving dark energy at beyond $2\,\sigma$ CL, respectively. Our results are different from $\omega_0=-0.55^{+0.39}_{-0.21}$ and the $2\,\sigma$ upper limit $\omega_a&lt;-1.32$ reported by the DESI collaboration \cite{DESI:2024mwx}. Employing a data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova, we obtain the $1\,\sigma$, $2\,\sigma$ and $3\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=-0.707^{+0.089+0.18+0.24}_{-0.089-0.17-0.22}$ and $\omega_a=-1.09^{+0.38+0.67+0.82}_{-0.31-0.72-1.00}$, which reveals a $\sim4\,\sigma$ evidence of dynamical dark energy when the redshift $z\lesssim0.1$. We verify that the BAO data point from luminous red galaxies at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ hardly affects the joint constraint from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova. We also point out the shortcomings and advantages of the binning method widely used in cosmological analyses.</description>

Abstract: The Special Issue on "Modified Gravity Approaches to the Tensions of $\Lambda$CDM"} in the Universe journal tackles significant challenges faced by the $\Lambda$CDM model, including discrepancies in the Hubble constant, growth rate of structures, and cosmological anisotropies. These issues suggest foundational cracks in the model, raising questions about the validity of General Relativity, dark energy, and cosmological principles at large scales. This collection brings together leading researchers to delve into Modified Gravity theories as potential solutions. Covering approaches from Scalar-Tensor theories to $f(R,T)$ gravity and beyond, each contribution presents innovative research aimed at addressing the limitations of the $\Lambda$CDM model. This Special Issue not only highlights the theoretical and empirical strengths of Modified Gravity models but also opens avenues for future investigations, emphasizing the synergy between theoretical advancements and observational evidence to deepen our cosmological understanding.</description>

      <title>Local univalence versus stability and causality in hydrodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main objective is to compare the analytic properties of hydrodynamic series with the stability and causality conditions applied to hydrodynamic modes. Analyticity, in this context, implies that the hydrodynamic series behaves as a univalent or single-valued function. Stability and causality adhere to physical constraints where hydrodynamic modes neither exhibit exponential growth nor travel faster than the speed of light. Through an examination of various hydrodynamic models, such as the Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) and the first-order hydro models like the BDNK (Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun) model, we observe no new restrictions stemming from the analyticity limits in the shear channel of these models. However, local univalence is maintained in the sound channel of these models despite the global divergence of the hydrodynamic series. Notably, differences in the sound equations between the MIS and BDNK models lead to distinct analyticity limits. The MIS model's sound mode remains univalent at high momenta within a specific transport range. Conversely, in the BDNK model, the univalence of the sound mode extends to intermediate momenta across all stable and causal regions. Generally, the convergence radius is independent of univalence and the given dispersion relation predominantly influences their correlation. For second-order frequency dispersions, the relationship is precise, i.e. within the convergence radius, the hydro series demonstrates univalence. However, with higher-order dispersions, the hydro series is locally univalent within certain transport regions, which may fall within or outside the stable and causal zones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe deeply into the characteristics of thin accretion disk surrounding black hole within the brane world paradigm. We investigate how model parameters affect the physical properties of the disk. Our findings indicate that as the tidal charge parameter inherited from the higher dimension increases, the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the spectral cutoff frequency, the spectral luminosity, and the conversion efficiency of the disk all increase, but the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit decreases. Compared to cases of the Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes, the disk is hotter and more luminous for positive tidal charge parameter, while it is cooler and less luminous for negative tidal charge parameter, which suggests the potential for probing possible signatures of higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect from simulations on Euclidean lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Euclidean-time correlator of axial charge and electric current as an observable that can be used to study the out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in first-principle lattice QCD simulations with background magnetic field. This observable directly reflects the fact that in the background magnetic field, a state with nonzero axial charge features nonzero electric current. For free fermions, the axial-vector correlator only receives contributions from the Lowest Landau Level, and features a linear dependence on both magnetic field and temperature with a universal coefficient. With an appropriate regularization, non-vanishing axial-vector correlator is compatible with the vanishing of the CME current in thermal equilibrium state with nonzero chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. We demonstrate that the real-time counterpart of the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator is intimately related to the real-time form of the axial anomaly equation, which strongly limits possible corrections in full QCD. We present numerical results for the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator in $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory with $N_f = 2$ light quark flavours, demonstrating perfect agreement with free fermion result on both sides of the chiral crossover. The proposed methodology should help to answer the question whether the QCD corrections might be responsible for non-observation of CME in RHIC isobar run.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for producing Primordial Black Holes from Inflationary Models Beyond Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the fine-tuning required in various inflationary models in order to explain the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We specifically examine the degree of fine-tuning necessary in two prominent single field inflationary models: those with an inflection point and those with step-like features in the potential. Our findings indicate that models with step-like features generally require less fine-tuning compared to those with an inflection point, making them more viable for consistent PBH production. An interesting outcome of these models is that, in addition to improved fine-tuning, they may also predict low-frequency signals that can be detected by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multifield inflationary models to assess whether the integration of additional fields can further alleviate the fine-tuning demands. The study also explores the role of a spectator field and its impact on the fine-tuning process. Through a comparative analysis across these models, we evaluate their parametric sensitivities and alignment with the constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Our results indicate that although mechanisms involving a spectator field can circumvent the issue of fine-tuning parameters for PBH production, both multifield models and models with step-like features present promising alternatives. While fine-tuning involves multiple considerations, our primary objective is to evaluate various inflationary models to identify the one that most naturally explains the formation of PBHs. Hence, this study aims to the development of less constrained inflationary scenarios that align with observational data and support the theoretical possibility of PBH production.</description>

      <title>Regularized Conformal Electrodynamics: Novel C-metric in (2+1) Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal electrodynamics is a particularly interesting example of power Maxwell non-linear electrodynamics, designed to possess conformal symmetry in all dimensions. In this paper, we propose a regularized version of Conformal electrodynamics, minimally regularizing the field of a point charge at the origin by breaking the conformal invariance of the theory with a dimensionfull "Born-Infeld-like" parameter. In four dimensions the new theory reduces to the recently studied Regularized Maxwell electrodynamics, distinguished by its "Maxwell-like" solutions for accelerated and slowly rotating black hole spacetimes. Focusing on three dimensions, we show that the new theory shares many of the properties of its four-dimensional cousin, including the existence of the charged C-metric solution (currently unknown in the Maxwell theory).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT relation, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

      <title>Towards testing the general bounce cosmology with the CMB B-mode auto-bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that a three-point correlation function of tensor perturbations from a bounce model in general relativity with a minimally-coupled scalar field is highly suppressed, and the resultant three-point function of cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarizations is too small to be detected by CMB experiments. On the other hand, bounce models in a more general class with a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and gravity can predict the three-point correlation function of the tensor perturbations without any suppression, the amplitude of which is allowed to be much larger than that in general relativity. In this paper, we evaluate the three-point function of the B-mode polarizations from the general bounce cosmology with the non-minimal coupling and show that a signal-to-noise ratio of the B-mode auto-bispectrum in the general class can reach unity for $\ell_{\rm max}\geq9$ and increase up to $5.39$ for $\ell_{\rm max}=100$ in the full-sky case. We also discuss the possibility to test the general class of bounce models by upcoming CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>(Non-)unitarity of strictly and partially massless fermions on de Sitter space II: an explanation based on the group-theoretic properties of the spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 eigenmodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09851v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous article [Letsios 2023 J. High Energ. Phys. JHEP05(2023)015], we showed that the strictly massless spin-3/2 field, as well as the strictly and partially massless spin-5/2 fields, on $N$-dimensional ($N \geq 3 $) de Sitter spacetime ($dS_{N}$) are non-unitary unless $N=4$. The (non-)unitarity was demonstrated by simply observing that there is a (mis-)match between the representation-theoretic labels that correspond to the Unitary Irreducible Representations (UIR's) of the de Sitter (dS) algebra spin$(N,1)$ and the ones corresponding to the space of eigenmodes of the field theories. In this paper, we provide a technical representation-theoretic explanation for this fact by studying the (non-)existence of positive-definite, dS invariant scalar products for the spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 strictly/partially massless eigenmodes on $dS_{N}$ ($N \geq 3$). Our basic tool is the examination of the action of spin$(N,1)$ generators on the space of eigenmodes, leading to the following findings. For odd $N$, any dS invariant scalar product is identically zero. For even $N &gt; 4$, any dS invariant scalar product must be indefinite. This gives rise to positive-norm and negative-norm eigenmodes that mix with each other under spin$(N,1)$ boosts. In the $N=4$ case, the positive-norm sector decouples from the negative-norm sector and each sector separately forms a UIR of spin$(4,1)$. Our analysis makes extensive use of the analytic continuation of tensor-spinor spherical harmonics on the $N$-sphere ($S^{N}$) to $dS_{N}$ and also introduces representation-theoretic techniques that are absent from the mathematical physics literature on half-odd-integer-spin fields on $dS_{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons that coherently rotate in field space. We show that these coherent rotations can induce superradiance for scattering waves, thanks to the fact that the scattering involves two coupled modes. Despite the conservation of the particle number in the scattering, the mismatch between the frequencies of the two modes allows for the enhancement of the energy and angular momentum of incident waves. When the Q-ball spins in real space, additional rotational superradiance is also possible, which can further boost the enhancements. We identify the criteria for the energy and angular momentum superradiance to occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Canonical quantization of the photon -- a free massless vector field -- is considered in cosmological spacetimes in a two-parameter family of linear gauges that treat all the vector potential components on equal footing. The goal is setting up a framework for computing photon two-point functions appropriate for loop computations in realistic inflationary spacetimes. The quantization is implemented without relying on spacetime symmetries, but rather it is based on the classical canonical structure. Special attention is paid to the quantization of the canonical first-class constraint structure that is implemented as the condition on the physical states. This condition gives rise to subsidiary conditions that the photon two-point functions must satisfy. Some of the de Sitter space photon propagators from the literature are found not to satisfy these subsidiary conditions, bringing into question their consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explicit covariant actions and propagators are given for fields describing particles of all spins and masses, in any spacetime dimension. Massive particles are realized as "dimensionally reduced" massless particles. To obtain compact expressions for the propagators, it was useful to introduce an auxiliary vector coordinate $s^{\mu}$ and consider "hyperfields" that are functions of space $X^{\mu}$ and $s^{\mu}$. The actions and propagators serve as a basic starting point for concrete high spin computations amenable to dimensional regularization, provided that gauge invariant interactions are introduced.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries in (3+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries are important tools for understanding the dynamics of quantum systems. We investigate anomalies of non-invertible symmetries in 3+1d using 4+1d bulk topological quantum field theories given by Abelian two-form gauge theories, with a 0-form permutation symmetry. Gauging the 0-form symmetry gives the 4+1d "inflow" symmetry topological field theory for the non-invertible symmetry. We find a two levels of anomalies: (1) the bulk may fail to have an appropriate set of loop excitations which can condense to trivialize the boundary dynamics, and (2) the "Frobenius-Schur indicator" of the non-invertible symmetry (generalizing the Frobenius-Schur indicator of 1+1d fusion categories) may be incompatible with trivial boundary dynamics. As a consequence we derive conditions for non-invertible symmetries in 3+1d to be compatible with symmetric gapped phases, and invertible gapped phases. Along the way, we see that the defects characterizing $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ ordinary symmetry host worldvolume theories with time-reversal symmetry $\mathsf{T}$ obeying the algebra $\mathsf{T}^{2}=C$ or $\mathsf{T}^{2}=(-1)^{F}C,$ with $C$ a unitary charge conjugation symmetry. We classify the anomalies of this symmetry algebra in 2+1d and further use these ideas to construct 2+1d topological orders with non-invertible time-reversal symmetry that permutes anyons. As a concrete realization of our general discussion, we construct new lattice Hamiltonian models in 3+1d with non-invertible symmetry, and constrain their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Trace Anomaly of Weyl Fermions via the Path Integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the trace, diffeomorphism and Lorentz anomalies of a free Weyl fermion in a gravitational background field by path integral methods. This is achieved by regularising the variation of the determinant of the Weyl operator building on earlier work by Leutwyler. The trace anomaly is found to be one half of the one of a Dirac fermion. Most importantly we establish that the potential parity-odd curvature term $R \tilde R$, corresponding to the Pontryagin density, vanishes. This is to the contrary of some recent findings in the literature which gave rise to a controversy. We verify, that the regularisation does not lead to (spurious) anomalies in the Lorentz and diffeomorphism symmetries. We argue that in $d = 2\;(\textrm{mod } 4)$ $P$- and $CP$-odd terms cannot appear and that for $d = 4\;(\textrm{mod } 4)$ they are absent at least at leading order.</description>

      <title>New conformal-like symmetry of strictly massless fermions in four-dimensional de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new infinitesimal `conformal-like' symmetries for the field equations of strictly massless spin-$s \geq 3/2$ totally symmetric tensor-spinors (i.e. gauge potentials) on 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_{4}$). The corresponding symmetry transformations are generated by the five closed conformal Killing vectors of $dS_{4}$, but they are not conventional conformal transformations. We show that the algebra generated by the ten de Sitter (dS) symmetries and the five conformal-like symmetries closes on the conformal-like algebra $so(4,2)$ up to gauge transformations of the gauge potentials. The transformations of the gauge-invariant field strength tensor-spinors under the conformal-like symmetries are given by the product of $\gamma^{5}$ times a usual infinitesimal conformal transformation of the field strengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the two sets of physical mode solutions, corresponding to the two helicities $\pm s$ of the strictly massless theories, form a direct sum of Unitary Irreducible Representations (UIRs) of the conformal-like algebra. We also fill a gap in the literature by explaining how these physical modes form a direct sum of Discrete Series UIRs of the dS algebra $so(4,1)$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the fractonic dipole-conserving algebra can be obtained as an Aristotelian (and pseudo-Carrollian) contraction of the Poincar\'e algebra in one dimension higher. Such contraction allows to obtain fracton electrodynamics from a relativistic higher-dimensional theory upon dimensional reduction. The contraction procedure produces several scenarios including the some of the theories already discussed in the literature. A curved space generalization is given, which is gauge invariant when the Riemann tensor of the background geometry is harmonic.</description>

      <title>The two upper critical dimensions of the Ising and Potts models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the exact actions of the $Q$-state Potts model valid on any graph, first for the spin degrees of freedom, and second for the Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters. In both cases the field is a traceless $Q$-component scalar field $\Phi^\alpha$. For the Ising model ($Q=2$), the field theory for the spins has upper critical dimension $d_{\rm c}^{\rm spin}=4$, whereas for the clusters it has $d_{\rm c}^{\rm cluster}=6$. As a consequence, the probability for three points to be in the same cluster is not given by mean-field theory for $d$ within $4&lt;d&lt;6$. We estimate the associated universal structure constant as $C=\sqrt{6-d}+ {\cal O}(6-d)^{3/2}$. This shows that some observables in the Ising model have an upper critical dimension of 4, while others have an upper critical dimension of $6$. Combining perturbative results from the $\epsilon=6-d$ expansion with a non-perturbative treatment close to dimension $d=4$ allows us to locate the shape of the critical domain of the Potts model in the whole $(Q,d)$ plane.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, we showed that the gravitational wave spectrum from trans-Planckian shockwave scattering in Einstein gravity is determined by the gravitational Lipatov vertex expressed as the bilinear double copy $\Gamma^{\mu\nu} = \frac12 C^\mu C^\nu - \frac12 N^\mu N^\nu$ where $C^\mu$ is the QCD Lipatov vertex and $N^\mu$ is the QED soft photon factor. We show here that this result can be directly obtained by careful application of the classical color-kinematic duality to the spectrum obtained in gluon shockwave collisions.</description>

Abstract: This is the first of a series of two papers in which we study the one-dimensional defect CFT defined by insertions of local operators along a $\tfrac{1}{2}$-BPS Wilson line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. In this first paper we focus on the kinematical implications of invariance under the $\mathfrak{osp}(4^*|4)$ superconformal algebra preserved by the line. We study correlation functions involving both protected and unprotected supermultiplets and derive the associated superconformal blocks, using two types of superspace for short and long representations. We also discuss the spectrum of defect theories defined by the Wilson line, focusing in particular on fundamental lines in the planar limit: in this case we provide a detailed analysis of the type and number of states both at weak 't Hooft coupling, via the free gauge theory description of the defect CFT, and at strong coupling, where there is a dual description via AdS/CFT. Focusing on the strongly-coupled regime, which will be subject to a detailed analysis using analytic bootstrap techniques in a companion paper, we also develop a strategy that allows to explicitly build superconformal primary operators and their superconformal descendants in terms of the elementary fields in the AdS Lagrangian description. The explicit results will be used in a companion paper to address the problem of operators mixing at strong coupling. This paper and its companion provide an extended version of the results presented in 2103.10440.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Smooth Conformal Defects in Chern-Simons-Matter Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expectation value of a smooth conformal line defect in a CFT is a conformal invariant functional of its path in space-time. For example, in large $N$ holographic theories, these fundamental observables are dual to the open string partition function in AdS. In this paper, we develop a bootstrap method for studying them and apply it to conformal line defects in Chern-Simons matter theories. In these cases, the line bootstrap is based on three minimal assumptions -- conformal invariance of the line defect, large $N$ factorization, and the spectrum of the two lowest-lying operators at the end of the line. On the basis of these assumptions, we solve the one-dimensional CFT on the line and systematically compute the defect expectation value in an expansion around the straight line. We find that the conformal symmetry of a straight defect is insufficient to fix the answer. Instead, imposing the conformal symmetry of the defect along an arbitrary curved line leads to a functional bootstrap constraint. The solution to this constraint is found to be unique.</description>

      <title>Can Bell inequalities be tested via scattering cross-section at colliders ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on the bilinear form of the spin correlations, and not all local hidden variable models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM, which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still rule out a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-dimensional Chern-Simons (4DCS) theory is useful for understanding integrable sigma-models and constructing new ones. In this paper, we show how to derive the complete pure spinor $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring sigma-model from 4DCS theory with defects. The matter sector of this sigma model was previously derived by Costello and Yamazaki, and we propose here that the pure spinor ghosts come from gauge-fixing meromorphic transformations of 4DCS which lead to the usual pure spinor Lax connection including the ghost contribution.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity of the extended Schwarzschild-de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to static patch holography, de Sitter space admits a unitary quantum description in terms of a dual theory living on the stretched horizon, that is a timelike surface close to the cosmological horizon. In this manuscript, we compute several holographic complexity conjectures in a periodic extension of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole. We consider multiple configurations of the stretched horizons to which geometric objects are anchored. The holographic complexity proposals admit a hyperfast growth when the gravitational observables only lie in the cosmological patch, except for a class of complexity=anything observables that admit a linear growth. All the complexity conjectures present a linear increase when restricted to the black hole patch, similar to the AdS case. When both the black hole and the cosmological regions are probed, codimension-zero proposals are time-independent, while codimension-one proposals can have non-trivial evolution with linear increase at late times. As a byproduct of our analysis, we find that codimension-one spacelike surfaces are highly constrained in Schwarzschild-de Sitter space. Therefore, different locations of the stretched horizon give rise to different behaviours of the complexity conjectures.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Veneziano and Shapiro-Virasoro amplitudes to four arbitrarily excited states in bosonic string theory. We use the formalism of coherent string states based on the Di Vecchia-Del Giudice-Fubini construction. Within the same formalism, we also analyze the three string scattering finding the covariant version of the three reggeon interaction. Then studying the factorization properties of the extended four string scattering amplitudes we identify the covariant version of the three string interaction. Finally we obtain generalized Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations connecting the scattering of four open and closed arbitrarily excited states.</description>

      <title>Manifest color-kinematics duality for point particles interacting with self-dual fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that point particles interacting with a self-dual Yang-Mills field and self-dual gravity manifestly satisfy color-kinematics duality at the level of action. In a similar way color-kinematics duality also holds for a scalar field minimally coupled to a self-dual Yang-Mills field and self-dual gravity. By applying the appropriate limiting procedure to these scalar field theories we reproduce point particle theories we started from. This allows us to connect worldline color-kinematics duality to amplitude color-kinematics duality in field theory. Considering that point particles act as sources of classical solutions, our results may be regarded as a step towards establishing a precise relation between the amplitude and the classical double copies in the self-dual sector. Finally, we briefly mention that the extension of this discussion to the higher-spin case suggests that scalar point particles cannot interact with chiral higher-spin fields.</description>

      <title>The energy-frequency diagram of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two different methods are used to study the existence and stability of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon. The variational technique approximates it by a periodic function with a set of adiabatically changing parameters. An alternative approach treats oscillons as standing waves in a finite-size box; these are sought as solutions of a boundary-value problem on a two-dimensional domain. The numerical analysis reveals that the standing wave's energy-frequency diagram is fragmented into disjoint segments with $\omega_{n-1} &lt; \omega &lt; \omega_{n-2}$, where $\omega_n=\frac{2}{n+1}$. In the interval $(\omega_{n-1}, \omega_{n-2})$, the structure's small-amplitude wings are formed by the $n$-th harmonic radiation ($n=2,3, ...$). All standing waves are practically stable: perturbations may result in the deformation of the wave's radiation wings but do not affect its core. The variational approximation involving the first, zeroth and second harmonic components provides an accurate description of the oscillon with the frequency in $(\omega_1, \omega_0)$, but breaks down as $\omega$ falls out of that interval.</description>

      <title>Signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of complex order-three random tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the signed distribution of the eigenvalues/vectors of the complex order-three random tensor by computing a partition function of a four-fermi theory, where signs are from a Hessian determinant associated to each eigenvector. The issue of the presence of a continuous degeneracy of the eigenvectors is properly treated by a gauge-fixing. The final expression is compactly represented by a generating function, which has an expansion whose powers are the dimensions of the tensor index spaces. A crosscheck is performed by Monte Carlo simulations. By taking the large-$N$ limit we obtain a critical point where the behavior of the signed distribution qualitatively changes, and also the end of the signed distribution. The expected agreement of the end of the signed distribution with that of the genuine distribution provides a few applications, such as the largest eigenvalue, the geometric measure of entanglement, and the best rank-one approximation in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Chromoelectric flux tubes within non-Abelian Proca theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux tube solutions within non-Abelian SU(3) Proca theory with external sources are obtained. It is shown that such tubes have a longitudinal chromoelectric field possessing two components (nonlinear and gradient), as well as a transverse chromomagnetic field whose force lines create concentric circles with the center on the axis of the tube. The scenario of a possible relationship between non-Abelian Proca theory and quantum chromodynamics is considered. In such scenario: (a)~the components of color fields have different behavior: those which are almost classical, and those which are purely quantum; (b)~the second components create a gluon condensate that is a source of the field for the almost classical components of the Proca field; (c)~Proca masses may appear as a result of an approximate description of the gluon condensate; (d)~the question of gauge invariance is considered. It is shown that the results obtained are in good agreement with the results of lattice calculations. We make an assumption that an approximate description of a flux tube in quantum chromodynamics can be carried out using classical Proca equations but with a mandatory account of a gluon condensate.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of renormalization group flow, Perelman's entropy functional, and emergent dual holography in the worldsheet nonlinear $\sigma$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the renormalization group (RG) flow of worldsheet bosonic string theory, we construct an effective holographic dual description, where an extra dimension is identified with an RG scale. As a result, we obtain a dilaton-gravity effective theory for the dynamics of an emergent target spacetime, analogous to the low-energy description of bosonic M theory. We argue that this holographic dual effective field theory is non-perturbative in nature for the $\alpha'$ expansion, where the RG flow of the target spacetime manifests in the level of an effective bulk action. Based on the holographic dual effective field theory, we investigate the monotonicity of the RG flow. Inspired by the monotonicity of the Ricci flow given by Perelman, we propose a holographic construction of the Perelman's entropy functional. Based on the equivalence between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the local RG equation, we show that the RG flow of holographic Perelman's entropy functional is nothing but the Weyl anomaly. This leads us to the monotonicity of the RG flow of the emergent target spacetime. Furthermore, considering the entropy production along the RG flow, we construct a microscopic entropy functional based on the probability distribution function of the holographic dual effective field theory, regarded as Gibbs or Shannon entropy. We find that the monotonicity of this microscopically constructed entropy functional shows a strong connection with the monotonicity of the holographic Perelman's entropy functional.</description>

Abstract: We compute the one-loop $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitude of massless scalars on the world volume of an infinite $D = 11$ supermembrane quantized in the static gauge. The resulting expression is manifestly finite and turns out to be much simpler than in the bosonic membrane case in arXiv:2308.12189 being simply proportional to the tree-level scattering amplitude. We also consider the case of $\mathbb{R}^{1,1} \times S^1$ membrane with one dimension compactified on a circle of radius R and demonstrate how the supermembrane scattering amplitude reduces to the one on an infinite $D = 10$ Green-Schwarz superstring in the limit of R $\rightarrow 0$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in celestial holography, which is holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. This holographic duality exhibits numerous mysterious and fruitful features, particularly on the dual CFT side. In this paper, we present the candidate of dual CFT for Minkowski spacetime extracted from $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/SU(2)\cong H^+_3$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model, the simplest non-compact CFT. We demonstrate that it reproduces the well-known principal series and correlation functions dual to the bulk scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of Higgs mechanism within the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking has offered a new perspective on the early time cosmic inflation and also on the relationship between elementary particles and dark energy, believed to drive the universe's accelerating expansion. We suggest an inflation scenario driven by the Higgs boson within the framework of unimodular gravity, where the Higgs field acts as the inflaton and has a significant non-minimal coupling to the gravity. We present a detailed analysis of the problem in the Jordan and then Einstein frame for a unimodular Higgs inflation, followed by a comparison of our findings with the Cosmic Microwave Background observations made by the Planck Collaboration and other joint data sets. Therefore, new constraints are imposed on the non-minimal coupling parameter, $\xi$, by determining the magnitudes required for effective cosmic inflation. We demonstrate that a substantial non-minimal coupling of order $\xi\sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$ is required for this model to match with the observed primordial spectrum.</description>

To be able to use the existing literature on Heun functions, we try to put our wave equation to the standard form for these functions. Then we calculate the reflection coefficient of a wave coming from infinity and scattered at the center using this formalism using two independent methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for reaching pseudorandom quantum states, computationally indistinguishable from Haar random, with shallow log-n depth quantum circuits, where n is the number of qudits. We argue that $\log n$ depth 2-qubit-gate-based generic random quantum circuits that are claimed to provide a lower bound on the speed of information scrambling, cannot produce computationally pseudorandom quantum states. This conclusion is connected with the presence of polynomial (in $n$) tails in the stay probability of short Pauli strings that survive evolution through such shallow circuits. We show, however, that stay-probability-tails can be eliminated and pseudorandom quantum states can be accomplished with shallow $\log n$ depth circuits built from a special universal family of `inflationary' quantum (IQ) gates. We prove that IQ-gates cannot be implemented with 2-qubit gates, but can be realized either as a subset of 2-qudit-gates in $U(d^2)$ with $d\ge 3$ and $d$ prime, or as special 3-qubit gates.</description>

Abstract: The energy-energy correlator (EEC) is an observable of wide interest for collider physics and Standard Model measurements, due to both its simple theoretical description in terms of the energy-momentum tensor and its novel features for experimental studies. Significant progress has been made in both applications and higher-order perturbative predictions for the EEC. Here, we analyze the nature of the asymptotic perturbative series for the EEC by determining its analytic form in Borel space under the bubble-sum approximation. This result provides information on the leading and subleading nonperturbative power corrections through renormalon poles. We improve the perturbative convergence of the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ series for the EEC by removing its leading renormalon using an R scheme, which is independent of the bubble-sum approximation. Using the leading R-scheme power correction determined by fits to thrust, we find good agreement with EEC OPAL data already at ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s^2)$.</description>

      <title>Isometries and the double copy</title>

Abstract: In the standard derivation of the Kerr-Schild double copy, the geodicity of the Kerr-Schild vector and the stationarity of the spacetime are presented as assumptions that are necessary for the single copy to satisfy Maxwell's equations. However, it is well known that the vacuum Einstein equations imply that the Kerr-Schild vector is geodesic and shear-free, and that the spacetime possesses a distinguished vector field that is simultaneously a Killing vector of the full spacetime and the flat background, but need not be timelike with respect to the background metric. We show that the gauge field obtained by contracting this distinguished Killing vector with the Kerr-Schild graviton solves the vacuum Maxwell equations, and that this definition of the Kerr-Schild double copy implies the Weyl double copy when the spacetime is Petrov type D. When the Killing vector is taken to be timelike with respect to the background metric, we recover the familiar Kerr-Schild double copy, but the prescription is well defined for any vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetime and we present new examples where the Killing vector is null or spacelike. While most examples of physical interest are type D, vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetimes are generically of Petrov type II. We present a straightforward example of such a spacetime and study its double copy structure. Our results apply to real Lorentzian spacetimes as well as complex spacetimes and real spacetimes with Kleinian signature, and provide a simple correspondence between real and self-dual vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetimes. This correspondence allows us to study the double copy structure of a self-dual analog of the Kerr spacetime. We provide evidence that this spacetime may be diffeomorphic to the self-dual Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Inflation in simple one-loop effective potentials of perturbative quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inflation in scalar-tensor perturbative quantum gravity driven by a one-loop effective potential. We consider effective potentials generated by three models. The first model describes a single scalar field with a non-vanishing mass. The second model describes a massless scalar field with non-minimal coupling to the Einstein tensor. The third model generalises the Coleman-Weinberg model for the gravitational case. The first model can be consistent with the observational data for $N\sim 70$ e-foldings. The second model can be consistent with the observational data for $N \sim 40$ e-foldings. We did not find parameters that make the generalised Coleman-Weinberg model consistent with the observational data. We discuss the implications of these results and ways to improve them with other terms of effective action.</description>

Abstract: By assuming simultaneously the unitarity of the Hawking evaporation and the universality of Bekenstein entropy bound as well as the validity of cosmic censorship conjecture, we find that the black hole evaporation rate could evolve from the usual inverse square law in black hole mass into a constant evaporation rate near the end of the Hawking evaporation before quantum gravity could come into play, inferring a slightly longer lifetime for lighter black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the closed form expression for the metric perturbation around de Sitter spacetime generated by a matter source below Hubble scale both in generalized harmonic gauge and in Bondi gauge up to quadrupolar order in the multipolar expansion, including both parities (i.e. both mass and current quadrupoles). We demonstrate that such a source causes a displacement memory effect close to future infinity that originates, in the even-parity sector, from a $\Lambda$-BMS transition between the two non-radiative regions of future infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the shear viscosity for rotating fermions with spin-half under conditions of high temperature and density. We employ the Kubo formalism, rooted in finite-temperature quantum field theory, to compute the field correlation functions essential for this evaluation. The one-loop diagram pertinent to shear viscosity is analyzed within the context of curved space, utilizing tetrad formalism as an effective approach in cylindrical coordinates. Our findings focus on extremely high angular velocities, ranging from 0.1 to 1 GeV, which align with experimental expectations. Furthermore, we explore the inter-relationship between the chemical potential and angular velocity within the scope of this study.</description>

Abstract: A quest for phenomenological footprints of quantum gravity is among the central scientific tasks in the rising era of gravitational wave astronomy. We study gravitational wave dynamics within the noncommutative geometry framework, based on a Drinfeld twist and newly proposed noncommutative Einstein equation, and obtain the leading quantum correction to Regge-Wheeler potential up to first order in the noncommutativity parameter. By calculating the quasinormal mode frequencies we show that the noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole remains stable under axial gravitational perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The backreaction of quantum fields in their vacuum state results in equilibrium structures that surpass the Buchdahl compactness limit. Such backreaction is encapsulated in the vacuum expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET). In previous works we presented analytic approximations to the RSET, obtained by dimensional reduction, available in spherical symmetry, and showed that the backreaction-generated solutions described ultracompact fluid spheres with a negative mass interior. Here, we derive a novel approximation to the RSET that does not rely on dimensional reduction, but rather on a reduction of the differential order. This approximation also leads to regular stars surpassing the Buchdahl limit. We conclude that this is a consequence of the negative energies associated with the Boulware vacuum which, for sufficiently compact fluid spheres, make the Misner-Sharp mass negative near the centre of spherical symmetry. Our analysis provides further cumulative evidence that quantum vacuum polarization is capable of producing new forms of stellar equilibrium with robust properties accross different analytical approximations to the RSET.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the gradient expansion approximation to the light-cone gauge, obtaining a separate universe picture at non-linear order in perturbation theory within this framework. Thereafter, we use it to generalize the $\delta N$ formalism in terms of light-cone perturbations. As a consistency check, we demonstrate the conservation of the gauge invariant curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurface $\zeta$ at the completely non-linear level. The approach studied provides a self-consistent framework to connect at non-linear level quantities from the primordial universe, such as $\zeta$, written in terms of the light-cone parameters, to late time observables.</description>

      <title>Quark and lepton modular models from the binary dihedral flavor symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the structure of top-down derived models endowed with modular flavor symmetries, we investigate the yet phenomenologically unexplored binary dihedral group 2D_3. After building the vector-valued modular forms in the representations of 2D_3 with small modular weights, we systematically classify all (Dirac and Majorana) mass textures of fermions with fractional modular weights and all possible 2+1-family structures. This allows us to explore the parameter space of fermion models based on 2D_3, aiming at a description of both quarks and leptons with a minimal number of parameters and best compatibility with observed data. We consider the separate possibilities of neutrino masses generated by either a type-I seesaw mechanism or the Weinberg operator. We identify a model that, besides fitting all known flavor observables, delivers predictions for six not-yet measured parameters and favors normal-ordered neutrino masses generated by the Weinberg operator. It would be interesting to figure out whether it is possible to embed our model within a top-down scheme, such as T2/Z4 heterotic orbifold compactifications.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Lorentzian Regge calculus: causality violations, massless scalar field and discrete dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a model of spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic cosmology in Lorentzian Regge calculus, employing 4-dimensional Lorentzian frusta as building blocks. By examining the causal structure of the discrete spacetimes obtained by gluing such 4-frusta in spatial and temporal direction, we find causality violations if the sub-cells connecting spatial slices are spacelike. A Wick rotation to the Euclidean theory can be defined globally by a complexification of the variables and an analytic continuation of the action. Introducing a discrete free massless scalar field, we study its equations of motion and show that it evolves monotonically. Furthermore, in a continuum limit, we obtain the equations of a homogeneous scalar field on a spatially flat Friedmann background. Vacuum solutions to the causally regular Regge equations are static and flat and show a restoration of time reparametrisation invariance. In the presence of a scalar field, the height of a frustum is a dynamical variable that has a solution if causality violations are absent and if an inequality relating geometric and matter boundary data is satisfied. Edge lengths of cubes evolve monotonically, yielding a contracting or an expanding branch of the universe. In a small deficit angle expansion, the system can be deparametrised via the scalar field and a continuum limit of the discrete theory can be defined which we show to yield the relational Friedmann equation. These properties are obstructed if higher orders of the deficit angle are taken into account. Our results suggest that the inclusion of timelike sub-cells is necessary for a causally regular classical evolution in this symmetry restricted setting. Ultimately, this works serves as a basis for forthcoming investigations on the cosmological path integral within the framework of effective spin foams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for describing quantum fluctuations in field theory, with a focus on cosmological applications. Our method uniquely circumvents the use of operator/Hilbert-space formalism, instead relying on a systematic treatment of classical variables, quantum fluctuations, and an effective Hamiltonian. Our framework not only aligns with standard formalisms in flat and de Sitter spacetimes, which assumes no backreaction, demonstrated through the $\varphi^3$-model, but also adeptly handles time-dependent backreaction in more general cases. The uncertainty principle and spatial symmetry emerge as critical tools for selecting initial conditions and understanding effective potentials. We discover that modes inside the Hubble horizon \emph{do not} necessarily feel an initial Minkowski vacuum, as is commonly assumed. Our findings offer fresh insights into the early universe's quantum fluctuations and potential explanations to large-scale CMB anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unveil blind spot regions in dark matter (DM) direct detection (DMDD), for weakly interacting massive particles with a mass around a few hundred~GeV that may reveal interesting photon signals at the LHC. We explore a scenario where the DM primarily originates from the singlet sector within the $Z_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). A novel DMDD spin-independent blind spot condition is revealed for singlino-dominated DM, in cases where the mass parameters of the higgsino and the singlino-dominated lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) exhibit opposite relative signs (i.e., $\kappa &lt; 0$), emphasizing the role of nearby bino and higgsino-like states in tempering the singlino-dominated LSP. Additionally, proximate bino and/or higgsino states can act as co-annihilation partner(s) for singlino-dominated DM, ensuring agreement with the observed relic abundance of DM. Remarkably, in scenarios involving singlino-higgsino co-annihilation, higgsino-like neutralinos can distinctly favor radiative decay modes into the singlino-dominated LSP and a photon, as opposed to decays into leptons/hadrons. In exploring this region of parameter space within the singlino-higgsino compressed scenario, we study the signal associated with at least one relatively soft photon alongside a lepton, accompanied by substantial missing transverse energy and a hard initial state radiation jet at the LHC. In the context of singlino-bino co-annihilation, the bino state, as the next-to-LSP, exhibits significant radiative decay into a soft photon and the LSP, enabling the possible exploration at the LHC through the triggering of this soft photon alongside large missing transverse energy and relatively hard leptons/jets resulting from the decay of heavier higgsino-like states.</description>

Abstract: Integrability of N=1 supersymmetric Ruijsenaars-Schneider three-body models based upon the potentials W(x)=2/x, W(x)=2/sin(x), and W(x)=2/sinh(x) is proven. The problem of constructing an algebraically resolvable set of Grassmann-odd constants of motion is reduced to finding a triplet of vectors such that all their scalar products can be expressed in terms of the original bosonic first integrals. The supersymmetric generalizations are used to build novel integrable (iso)spin extensions of the respective Ruijsenaars-Schneider three-body systems.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant from the $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ and $\textrm{M87}^\star$ shadow prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) achieved the realization of an image of the supermassive black hole $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ showing an angular shadow diameter $\mathcal{D}= 48.7 \pm 7\mu as$ and the fractional deviation $\mathbf{\delta} = -0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.09}~\text{(VLTI)},-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~\text{(Keck)}$, alongside the earlier image of $\textrm{M87}^\star$ with angular diameter $ \mathcal{D}=42 \pm 3 \mu as$, deviation $\mathbf{\delta}=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and deviations from circularity estimated to be $\Delta \mathcal{C}\lesssim 10\%$. In addition, the shadow radii are assessed within the ranges $3.38 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 6.91$ for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $3.85 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.72$ as well as $3.95 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.92$ for $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and Keck observatories, respectively. These values are provided with $1$-$\sigma$ and $2$-$\sigma$ measurements. Such realizations can unveil a better comprehension of gravitational physics at the horizon scale. In this paper, we use the EHT observational results for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ to elaborate the constraints on parameters of accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant. Concretely, we utilize the mass and distance of both black holes to derive the observables associated with the accelerating black hole shadow. First, we compare our findings with observed quantities such as angular diameter, circularity, shadow radius, and the fractional deviation from the $\textrm{M87}^\star$ data. This comparison reveals constraints within the acceleration parameter and the cosmological constant...
  Lastly, one cannot rule out the possibility of the negative values for the cosmological constant on the emergence of accelerated black hole solutions within the context of minimal gauged supergravity...</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group, formulated directly in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators, whose number is considerably larger than those in $d=4$. We find new, potentially infrared stable fixed points spanned throughout the entire $N_f$ range. By conjecturing that the thermal chiral transition is governed by these ``flavor continuous" fixed points, stability analyses show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order chiral transition for $N_f=2,3,4$, and makes it almost indistinguishable from a second-order one, if it is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>
