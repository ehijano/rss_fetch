      <title>DogFit: Domain-guided Fine-tuning for Efficient Transfer Learning of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is challenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor generalization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies, i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling TFLOPS.</description>

      <title>Exploring Interactive Simulation of Grass Display Color Characteristic Based on Real-World Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on incorporating media into living environments via color-controlled materials and image display. In particular, grass-based displays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To develop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change characteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional methods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or viewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has begun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues as it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an interactive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on real-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's accuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints and environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results indicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics similar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more quickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study.</description>

      <title>HOLODECK 2.0: Vision-Language-Guided 3D World Generation with Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation, virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK 2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.</description>

      <title>LV-Net: Anatomy-aware lateral ventricle shape modeling with a case study on Alzheimer's disease, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of ageing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections, and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally, we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at https://github.com/PWonjung/LV_Shape_Modeling.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of Anisotropic Mesh Refinement: Omnitrees for Efficient Dyadic Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), commonly implemented via quadtrees and octrees, underpins a wide range of applications including databases, computer graphics, physics simulations, and machine learning. However, octrees enforce isotropic refinement in regions of interest, which can be especially inefficient for problems that are intrinsically anisotropic--much resolution is spent where little information is gained. This paper presents omnitrees as an anisotropic generalization of octrees and related data structures. Omnitrees allow to refine only the locally most important dimensions, providing tree structures that are less deep than bintrees and less wide than octrees. As a result, the convergence of the AMR schemes can be increased by up to a factor of the dimensionality d for very anisotropic problems, quickly offsetting their modest increase in storage overhead. We validate this finding on the problem of binary shape representation across 4,166 three-dimensional objects: Omnitrees increase the mean convergence rate by 1.5x, require less storage to achieve equivalent error bounds, and maximize the information density of the stored function faster than octrees. These advantages are projected to be even stronger for higher-dimensional problems. We provide a first validation by introducing a time-dependent rotation to create four-dimensional representations, and discuss the properties of their 4-d octree and omnitree approximations. Overall, omnitree discretizations can make existing AMR approaches more efficient, and open up new possibilities for high-dimensional applications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Adaptive Topology Representations for Zero-Shot Graph Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF), such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those "one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses. To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency (GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific, DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from $F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7 in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms of accuracy</description>

      <title>MoDA: Multi-modal Diffusion Architecture for Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a crucial problem in the realm of the virtual metaverse. Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this field with their strong generation capabilities. However, several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts caused by the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which complicates the diffusion process; 2) a lack of authentic facial expressions and head movements due to inadequate multi-modal information fusion. In this paper, MoDA handles these challenges by: 1) defining a joint parameter space that bridges motion generation and neural rendering, and leveraging flow matching to simplify diffusion learning; 2) introducing a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, enhancing overall facial expressiveness. In addition, a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

      <title>Localized Gaussians as Self-Attention Weights for Point Clouds Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current data-driven methodologies for point cloud matching demand extensive training time and computational resources, presenting significant challenges for model deployment and application. In the point cloud matching task, recent advancements with an encoder-only Transformer architecture have revealed the emergence of semantically meaningful patterns in the attention heads, particularly resembling Gaussian functions centered on each point of the input shape. In this work, we further investigate this phenomenon by integrating these patterns as fixed attention weights within the attention heads of the Transformer architecture. We evaluate two variants: one utilizing predetermined variance values for the Gaussians, and another where the variance values are treated as learnable parameters. Additionally we analyze the performances on noisy data and explore a possible way to improve robustness to noise. Our findings demonstrate that fixing the attention weights not only accelerates the training process but also enhances the stability of the optimization. Furthermore, we conducted an ablation study to identify the specific layers where the infused information is most impactful and to understand the reliance of the network on this information.</description>

      <title>Generative Video Bi-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel generative video model to robustly learn temporal change as a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) flow with a bilinear objective which combines two aspects: The first is to map from the past into future video frames directly. Previous work has mapped the noise to new frames, a more computationally expensive process. Unfortunately, starting from the previous frame, instead of noise, is more prone to drifting errors. Hence, second, we additionally learn how to remove the accumulated errors as the joint objective by adding noise during training. We demonstrate unconditional video generation in a streaming manner for various video datasets, all at competitive quality compared to a conditional diffusion baseline but with higher speed, i.e., fewer ODE solver steps.</description>
