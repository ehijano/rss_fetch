      <title>RIS-Aided E2E Multi-Path Uplink Transmission Optimization for 6G Time-Sensitive Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) defined in the 3GPP latest Release enables traffic flow over the multiple access paths to achieve the lower-latency End-to-end (E2E) delivery for 6G time-sensitive services. However, the existing E2E multi-path operation often falls short of more stringent QoS requirements for 6G time-sensitive services. This proposes a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-aided E2E multi-path uplink(UL) transmission architecture that explicitly accounts for both radio link latency and N3 backhaul latency, via the coupled designs of the UL traffic-splitting ratio, transmit power, receive combining, and RIS phase shift under practical constraints to achieve the minimum average E2E latency. We develop an alternating optimization framework that updates the above target parameters to be optimized. The simulations were conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed E2E optimization framework that lowers the average E2E latency up to 43% for a single user and 15% for the whole system compared with baselines.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Association of Semantics and Parameter Estimates by Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic semantic filtering framework in which parameters of a dynamical system are inferred and associated with a closed set of semantic classes in a map. We extend existing methods to a multi-parameter setting using a posterior that tightly couples semantics with the parameter likelihoods, and propose a filter to compute this posterior sequentially, subject to dynamics in the map's state. Using Bayesian moment matching, we show that the computational complexity of measurement updates scales linearly in the dimension of the parameter space. Finally, we demonstrate limitations of applying existing methods to a problem from the driving domain, and show that the proposed framework better captures time-varying parameter-to-semantic associations.</description>

      <title>Boundary adaptive observer design for semilinear hyperbolic rolling contact ODE-PDE systems with uncertain friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive observer design for semilinear hyperbolic rolling contact ODE-PDE systems with uncertain friction characteristics parameterized by a matrix of unknown coefficients appearing in the nonlinear (and possibly non-smooth) PDE source terms. Under appropriate assumptions of forward completeness and boundary sensing, an adaptive observer is synthesized to simultaneously estimate the lumped and distributed states, as well as the uncertain friction parameters, using only boundary measurements. The observer combines a finite-dimensional parameter estimator with an infinite-dimensional description of the state error dynamics, and achieves exponential convergence under persistent excitation. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated in simulation by considering a relevant example borrowed from road vehicle dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Discrete Age of Information of Status Updating System With General Packet Arrival Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing Age of Information (AoI) in status updating systems with general arrival and service processes has great significance considering that the interarrival and service time of updates can possibly be arbitrary in a real world. While expressions of average continuous AoI under G/G/1/1 queues have been derived in the paper by Soysal and Ulukus, the discrete case remained unsolved. To address it, this paper gives a fully characterization of probability generation functions (PGF) of discrete AoI under G/G/1/1 settings when preemption is allowed. In the non-preemptive case, this paper gives the expressions of PGF of discrete AoI under G/Geo/1/1 settings, which also extends the former results. The average discrete AoI is derived and discussed based on these new theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Semi-physical Gamma-Process Degradation Modeling and Performance-Driven Opportunistic Maintenance Optimization for LED Lighting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale LED lighting systems degrade through gradual package degradation and abrupt driver outages, while acceptability is determined by spatio-temporal illuminance compliance rather than component reliability alone. This paper proposes a performance-driven, simulation-in-the-loop framework for opportunistic maintenance optimization of LED lighting systems. LED package degradation is modeled by a semi-physical non-homogeneous Gamma process whose mean follows an exponential lumen-maintenance trend, and driver outages are described by a Weibull lifetime model. Parameters are calibrated from LM-80 accelerated degradation data via Bayesian inference, enabling uncertainty propagation to operating conditions. System performance is evaluated using ray-tracing-based illuminance mapping, and static indices (average illuminance and uniformity) are converted into a long-term dynamic deficiency-ratio metric via performance-deficiency durations over event intervals. To enable scalable Monte Carlo policy evaluation and search, a surrogate-based performance mapping replaces repeated ray-tracing with negligible loss of fidelity. An opportunistic policy is optimized in a multi-objective setting to balance performance deficiency, site visits, and replacements. A case study demonstrates the practicality of the framework and the resulting Pareto trade-offs for maintenance decision support.</description>

      <title>Semi-Contention-Free Access in IoT NOMA Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented surge of massive Internet of things (mIoT) traffic in beyond fifth generation (B5G) communication systems calls for transformative approaches for multiple access and data transmission. While classical model-based tools have been proven to be powerful and precise, an imminent trend for resource management in B5G networks is promoting solutions towards data-driven design. Considering an IoT network with devices spread in clusters covered by a base station, we present in this paper a novel model-free multiple access and data transmission framework empowered by reinforcement learning, designed for power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access networks to facilitate uplink traffic of small data packets. The framework supports two access modes referred to as contention-based and semi-contention-free, with its core component being a policy gradient algorithm executed at the base station. The base station performs access control and optimal radio resource allocation by periodically broadcasting two control parameters to each cluster of devices that considerably reduce data detection failures with a minimum computation requirement on devices. Numerical results, in terms of system and cluster throughput, throughput fairness, access delay, and energy consumption, demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the framework as network size and traffic load vary.</description>

      <title>Residual Power Flow for Neural Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy transition challenges operational tasks based on simulations and optimisation. These computations need to be fast and flexible as the grid is ever-expanding, and renewables' uncertainty requires a flexible operational environment. Learned approximations, proxies or surrogates -- we refer to them as Neural Solvers -- excel in terms of evaluation speed, but are inflexible with respect to adjusting to changing tasks. Hence, neural solvers are usually applicable to highly specific tasks, which limits their usefulness in practice; a widely reusable, foundational neural solver is required. Therefore, this work proposes the Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation. RPF formulates residual functions based on Kirchhoff's laws to quantify the infeasibility of an operating condition. The minimisation of the residuals determines the voltage solution; an additional slack variable is needed to achieve AC-feasibility. RPF forms a natural, foundational subtask of tasks subject to power flow constraints. We propose to learn RPF with neural solvers to exploit their speed. Furthermore, RPF improves learning performance compared to common power flow formulations. To solve operational tasks, we integrate the neural solver in a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to combine speed and flexibility. The case study investigates the IEEE 9-bus system and three tasks (AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), power-flow and quasi-steady state power flow) solved by PO. The results demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of learning with RPF.</description>

      <title>A Novel $\alpha\beta$-Approximation Method Based on Numerical Integration for Discretizing Continuous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel discretization method based on numerical integration for discretizing continuous systems, termed the $\alpha\beta$-approximation or Scalable Bilinear Transformation (SBT). In contrast to existing methods, the proposed method consists of two factors, i.e., shape factor ($\alpha$) and time factor ($\beta$). Depending on the discretization technique applied, we identify two primary distortion modes in discrete resonant controllers: frequency warping and resonance damping. We further provide a theoretical explanation for these distortion modes, and demonstrate that the performance of the method is superior to all typical methods. The proposed method is implemented to discretize a quasi-resonant (QR) controller on a control board, achieving 25\% reduction in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared to the SOTA method. Finally, the approach is extended to discretizing a resonant controller of a grid-tied inverter. The efficacy of the proposed method is conclusively validated through favorable comparisons among the theory, simulation, and experiments.</description>

      <title>System Availability Optimization: Integrating Quantity Discounts and Delivery Lead Time Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The model allocates the system components orders to the suppliers to minimize the parts price and the system construction delay penalties and maximize the system availability during its use. It considers the quantity-based discount and variation of delivery lead time by ordering similar components. The model also reflects the prerequisite relationships between construction activities and calculates the delay penalty resulting from parts delivery lead time. Design/methodology/approach: This research presents a model for selecting suppliers of components of an industrial series-parallel multi-state system. A nonlinear binary mathematical program uses the Markov process results to select system components. It minimizes the total system construction phase costs, including the components' price, and the system construction delay penalty, and the system exploitation phase costs, including the system shutdown and working at half capacity. Findings: The model allocates the optimal orders for a typical industrial system's components, composing four elements. The proposed approach combines the nonlinear binary program and the Markov process results to optimize the system life cycle parameters, including the system construction cost and operational availability. Originality/value: Using the Markov chain results in binary nonlinear mathematical programming, this study attempts to strike the right balance between the construction phase's objectives and an industrial unit's operation phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical report presents the construction and analysis of polynomial navigation functions for motion planning in 3-D workspaces populated by spherical and cylindrical obstacles. The workspace is modeled as a bounded spherical region, and obstacles are encoded using smooth polynomial implicit functions. We establish conditions under which the proposed navigation functions admit a unique non-degenerate minimum at the target while avoiding local minima, including in the presence of pairwise intersecting obstacles. Gradient and Hessian analyses are provided, and the theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations in obstacle rich 3-D environments.</description>

      <title>Two-Scale Spatial Deployment for Cost-Effective Wireless Networks via Cooperative IRSs and Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-scale spatial deployment strategy to ensure reliable coverage for multiple target areas, integrating macroscopic intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and fine-grained movable antennas (MAs). Specifically, IRSs are selectively deployed from candidate sites to shape the propagation geometry, while MAs are locally repositioned among discretized locations to exploit small-scale channel variations. The objective is to minimize the total deployment cost of MAs and IRSs by jointly optimizing the IRS site selection, MA positions, transmit precoding, and IRS phase shifts, subject to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for all target areas. This leads to a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem that is intractable to solve directly. To address this, we first formulate an auxiliary problem to verify the feasibility. A penalty-based double-loop algorithm integrating alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed to solve this feasibility issue, which is subsequently adapted to obtain a suboptimal solution for the original cost minimization problem. Finally, based on the obtained solution, we formulate an element refinement problem to further reduce the deployment cost, which is solved by a penalty-based SCA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed designs consistently outperform benchmarks relying on independent area planning or full IRS deployment in terms of cost-efficiency. Moreover, for cost minimization, MA architectures are preferable in large placement apertures, whereas fully populated FPA architectures excel in compact ones; for worst-case SNR maximization, MA architectures exhibit a lower cost threshold for feasibility, while FPA architectures can attain peak SNR at a lower total cost.</description>

      <title>Echo-Side Integrated Sensing and Communication via Space-Time Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an echo-side modulation framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A space-time reconfigurable intelligent surface (ST-RIS) impresses a continuous-phase modulation onto the radar echo, enabling uplink data transmission with a phase modulation of the transmitted radar-like waveform. The received signal is a multiplicative composition of the sensing waveform and the phase for communication. Both functionalities share the same physical signal and perceive each other as impairments.
  The achievable communication rate is expressed as a function of a coupling parameter that links sensing accuracy to phase error accumulation. Under a fixed bandwidth constraint, the sensing and communication figures of merit define a convex Pareto frontier. The optimal bandwidth allocation satisfying a minimum sensing requirement is derived in closed form. The modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) for range estimation is derived in closed form; this parameter must be estimated to compensate for the frequency offset before data demodulation. Frame synchronization is formulated as a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and the detection probability is obtained through characteristic function inversion, accounting for residual frequency errors from imperfect range estimation. Numerical results validate the theoretical bounds and characterize the trade-off across the operating range.</description>

      <title>From Prompt to Protocol: Fast Charging Batteries with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently optimizing battery charging protocols is challenging because each evaluation is slow, costly, and non-differentiable. Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations). These results demonstrate that LLMs can expand the space of protocol functional forms, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in high cost experimental settings.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy and Review of Algorithms for Modeling and Predicting Human Driver Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.08832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open problem in autonomous driving research is modeling human driving behavior, which is needed for the planning component of the autonomy stack, safety validation through traffic simulation, and causal inference for generating explanations for autonomous driving. Modeling human driving behavior is challenging because it is stochastic, high-dimensional, and involves interaction between multiple agents. This problem has been studied in various communities with a vast body of literature. Existing reviews have generally focused on one aspect: motion prediction. In this article, we present a unification of the literature that covers intent estimation, trait estimation, and motion prediction. This unification is enabled by modeling multi-agent driving as a partially observable stochastic game, which allows us to cast driver modeling tasks as inference problems. We classify driver models into a taxonomy based on the specific tasks they address and the key attributes of their approach. Finally, we identify open research opportunities in the field of driver modeling.</description>

      <title>Predictable Interval MDPs through Entropy Regularization</title>

Abstract: Regularization of control policies using entropy can be instrumental in adjusting predictability of real-world systems. Applications benefiting from such approaches range from, e.g., cybersecurity, which aims at maximal unpredictability, to human-robot interaction, where predictable behavior is highly desirable. In this paper, we consider entropy regularization for interval Markov decision processes (IMDPs). IMDPs are uncertain MDPs, where transition probabilities are only known to belong to intervals. Lately, IMDPs have gained significant popularity in the context of abstracting stochastic systems for control design. In this work, we address robust minimization of the linear combination of entropy and a standard cumulative cost in IMDPs, thereby establishing a trade-off between optimality and predictability. We show that optimal deterministic policies exist, and devise a value-iteration algorithm to compute them. The algorithm solves a number of convex programs at each step. Finally, through an illustrative example we show the benefits of penalizing entropy in IMDPs.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Distributed Edge Learning: Seamless Integration in Next-Generation Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed edge learning (DL) is considered a cornerstone of intelligence enablers, since it allows for collaborative training without the necessity for local clients to share raw data with other parties, thereby preserving privacy and security. Integrating DL into the 6G networks requires a coexistence design with existing services such as high-bandwidth (HB) traffic like eMBB. Current designs in the literature mainly focus on communication round-wise designs that assume a rigid resource allocation throughout each communication round (CR). However, rigid resource allocation within a CR is a highly inefficient and inaccurate representation of the system's realistic behavior, especially when CR duration far exceeds the channel coherence time due to large model size or limited resources. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the system, as clients inherently may need to access the network at different time instants. This work zooms into one arbitrary CR, and demonstrates the importance of considering a time-dependent design for sharing the resource pool with HB traffic. We first formulate a timeslot-wise optimization problem to minimize the consumed time by DL within the CR while constrained by a DL energy budget. Due to its intractability, a session-based optimization problem is formulated assuming a CR lasts less than a large-scale coherence time. Some scheduling properties of such multi-server joint communication scheduling and resource allocation framework have been established. An iterative algorithm has been designed to solve such non-convex and non-block-separable-constrained problems. Simulation results confirm the importance of the efficient and accurate integration design proposed in this work.</description>

      <title>From learning to safety: A Direct Data-Driven Framework for Constrained Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in the sense of constraint satisfaction for learning-based control is a critical challenge, especially in the model-free case. While safety filters address this challenge in the model-based setting by modifying unsafe control inputs, they typically rely on predictive models derived from physics or data. This reliance limits their applicability for advanced model-free learning control methods. To address this gap, we propose a new optimization-based control framework that determines safe control inputs directly from data. The benefit of the framework is that it can be updated through arbitrary model-free learning algorithms to pursue optimal performance. As a key component, the concept of direct data-driven safety filters (3DSF) is first proposed. The framework employs a novel safety certificate, called the state-action control barrier function (SACBF). We present three different schemes to learn the SACBF. Furthermore, based on input-to-state safety analysis, we present the error-to-state safety analysis framework, which provides formal guarantees on safety and recursive feasibility even in the presence of learning inaccuracies. The proposed control framework bridges the gap between model-free learning-based control and constrained control, by decoupling performance optimization from safety enforcement. Simulations on vehicle control illustrate the superior performance regarding constraint satisfaction and task achievement compared to model-based methods and reward shaping.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Approximation-free Symbolic Control for Unknown Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel symbolic control framework for enforcing temporal logic specifications in Euler-Lagrange systems that addresses the key limitations of traditional abstraction-based approaches. Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Information Transfer via Digital Semantic Communication in UAV-Based Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In smart cities, bandwidth-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) often fail to relay mission-critical data in time, compromising real-time decision-making. This highlights the need for faster and more efficient transmission of only the most relevant information. To address this, we propose DSC-UAV model, leveraging a context-adaptive Digital Semantic Communication (DSC) framework. This model redefines aerial data transmission through three core components: prompt-aware encoding, dynamic UAV-enabled relaying, and user mobility-optimized reinforcement learning. Ground users transmit context-driven visual content. Images are encoded via Vision Transformer combined with a prompt-text encoder to generate semantic features based on the desired context (generic or object-specific). These features are then quantized and transmitted over a UAV network that dynamically relays the data. Joint trajectory and resource allocation are optimized using Truncated Quantile Critic (TQC)-aided reinforcement learning technique, which offers greater stability and precision over standard SAC and TD3 due to its resistance to overestimation bias. Simulations demonstrate significant performance improvement, up to 22% gain in semantic-structural similarity and 14% reduction in Age of Information (AoI) compared to digital and prior UAV-semantic communication baselines. By integrating mobility control with context-driven visual abstraction, DSC-UAV advances resilient, information-centric surveillance for next-generation UAV networks in bandwidth-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Provable Acceleration of Distributed Optimization with Local Updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional distributed optimization, each agent performs a single local update between two communication rounds with its neighbors to synchronize solutions. Inspired by the success of using multiple local updates in federated learning, incorporating local updates into distributed optimization has recently attracted increasing attention. However, unlike federated learning, where multiple local updates can accelerate learning by improving gradient estimation under mini-batch settings, it remains unclear whether similar benefits hold in distributed optimization when gradients are exact. Moreover, existing theoretical results typically require reducing the step size when multiple local updates are employed, which can entirely offset any potential benefit of these additional local updates and obscure their true impact on convergence. In this paper, we focus on the classic DIGing algorithm and leverage the tight performance bounds provided by Performance Estimation Problems (PEP) to show that incorporating local updates can indeed accelerate distributed optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous demonstration of such acceleration for a broad class of objective functions. Our analysis further reveals that, under an appropriate step size, performing only two local updates is sufficient to achieve the maximal possible improvement, and that additional local updates provide no further gains. Because more updates increase computational cost, these findings offer practical guidance for efficient implementation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Minimal Actuator Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selecting a few available actuators to ensure the controllability of a linear system is a fundamental problem in control theory. Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints. The latter equivalence is always true if the state matrix has all distinct eigenvalues, in which case it simplifies to the set cover problem. Such characterizations hold even when a robust selection that tolerates a given number of faulty actuators is desired. Our established connection legitimates a designer to use algorithms from the rich literature on the set multicover problem to select the smallest subset of actuators, including exact solutions that do not require brute-force search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Safe Protective and Assistive Robot Kit (SPARK), a comprehensive benchmark designed to ensure safety in humanoid autonomy and teleoperation. Humanoid robots pose significant safety risks due to their physical capabilities of interacting with complex environments. The physical structures of humanoid robots further add complexity to the design of general safety solutions. To facilitate safe deployment of complex robot systems, SPARK can be used as a toolbox that comes with state-of-the-art safe control algorithms in a modular and composable robot control framework. Users can easily configure safety criteria and sensitivity levels to optimize the balance between safety and performance. To accelerate humanoid safety research and development, SPARK provides simulation benchmarks that compare safety approaches in a variety of environments, tasks, and robot models. Furthermore, SPARK allows quick deployment of synthesized safe controllers on real robots. For hardware deployment, SPARK supports Apple Vision Pro (AVP) or a Motion Capture System as external sensors, while offering interfaces for seamless integration with alternative hardware setups at the same time. This paper demonstrates SPARK's capability with both simulation experiments and case studies with a Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Leveraging these advantages of SPARK, users and researchers can significantly improve the safety of their humanoid systems as well as accelerate relevant research.

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Bone Micro-Milling System with Automatic Calibration and 3D Surface Fitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automating bone micro-milling using a robotic system presents challenges due to the uncertainties in both the external and internal features of bone tissue. For example, during mouse cranial window creation, a circular path with a radius of 2 to 4 mm needs to be milled on the mouse skull using a microdrill. The uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the mouse skull make it difficult to fully automate this process, requiring the system to possess advanced perceptual and adaptive capabilities. In this study, we address this challenge by integrating a Microscopic Stereo Camera System (MSCS) into the robotic bone micro-milling system and proposing a novel online pre-measurement pipeline for the target surface. Starting from uncalibrated cameras, the pipeline enables automatic calibration and 3D surface fitting through a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based keypoint detection. Combined with the existing feedback-based system, we develop the world's first autonomous robotic bone micro-milling system capable of rapidly, in real-time perceiving and adapting to surface unevenness and non-uniform thickness, thereby enabling an end-to-end autonomous cranial window creation workflow without human assistance. Validation experiments on euthanized mice demonstrate that the improved system achieves a success rate of 85.7 % and an average milling time of 2.1 minutes, showing not only significant performance improvements over the previous system but also exceptional accuracy, speed, and stability compared to human operators.</description>

      <title>Integration Matters for Learning PDEs with Backward SDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering potential algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, standard BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to one-step self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step-sizes or multi-step self-consistency losses. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic cutting is a challenging contact-rich manipulation task where the robot must simultaneously negotiate unknown object mechanics, large contact forces, and precise motion requirements. We introduce a new active virtual-model control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators, without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment. Motion is generated and controlled through switching virtual coupling with virtual mechanisms, given by virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and platform independence.</description>

      <title>AQ-PCDSys: An Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System for Autonomous Space Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Successful autonomous planetary exploration hinges on real-time, high-fidelity environmental perception. However, standard deep learning models usually demand far more memory and computation power than space-qualified, radiation-hardened onboard hardware can provide. This creates a fundamental design challenge of deploying sophisticated detection architectures without saturating the rigid power and memory envelopes of the computation hardware of planetary exploration platforms. We propose the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System to resolve this bottleneck. Our framework integrates a Quantized Neural Network, refined through Quantization Aware Training, with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion module. By forcing weights into low-precision integer arithmetic, we effectively strip away the floating-point overhead that typically bottlenecks onboard processors and system memory. This yields a leaner model footprint and significantly faster processing while the detection fidelity remains high. Such efficiency enables AMF module to merge high-bandwidth Optical Imagery streams with Digital Elevation Models using an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism to re-balance sensor priority under variable conditions like deep shadows or high albedo. Integrated Multi-Scale Detection Heads then resolve craters across a wide range of diameters, providing a computationally efficient and precise solution for real-time detection, localization of craters and hazard avoidance. This paper establishes the architectural design and theoretical justification of the system. While our methodology is grounded in principles of hybrid computer vision and planetary science, we present this as a blueprint for future empirical validation and hardware benchmarking on integer-arithmetic units. This system provides a capability vital for the next generation of autonomous landing, navigation, and deep space explorations.</description>

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</description>

Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces (i) temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and (ii) statistical consistency of the detection tests, enabling regulators to verify correctness and prevent suppression of alarms without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero-knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</description>
