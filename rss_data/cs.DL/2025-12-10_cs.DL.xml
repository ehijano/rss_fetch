      <title>Investigating the originality of scientific papers across time and domain: A quantitative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of creativity in science has long sought quantitative metrics capable of capturing the originality of the scientific insights contained within articles and other scientific works. In recent years, the field has witnessed a substantial expansion of research activity, enabled by advances in natural language processing and network analysis, and has utilised both macro- and micro-scale approaches with success. However, they often do not examine the text itself for evidence of originality. In this paper, we apply a computational measure correlating with originality from creativity science, Divergent Semantic Integration (DSI), to a set of 51,200 scientific abstracts and titles sourced from the Web of Science. To adapt DSI for application to scientific texts, we advance the original BERT method by incorporating SciBERT (a model trained on scientific corpora) into the computation of DSI. In our study, we observe that DSI plays a more pronounced role in the accrual of early citations for papers with fewer authors, varies substantially across subjects and research fields, and exhibits a declining correlation with citation counts over time. Furthermore, by modelling SciBERT- and BERT-DSI as predictors of the logarithm of 5-year citation counts alongside field, publication year, and the logarithm of author count, we find statistically significant relationships, with adjusted R-squared of 0.103 and 0.101 for BERT-DSI and SciBERT-DSI. Because existing scientometric measures rarely assess the originality expressed in textual content, DSI provides a valuable means of directly quantifying the conceptual originality embedded in scientific writing.</description>

      <title>Any Old Tom, Dick or Harry: The Citation Impact of First Name Genderedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper attempts a first analysis of citation distributions based on the genderedness of authors' first name. Following the extraction of first name and sex data from all human entity triplets contained in Wikidata, a first name genderedness table is first created based on compiled sex frequencies, then merged with bibliometric data from eponymous, US-affiliated authors. Comparisons of various cumulative distributions show that citation concentrations fluctuations are highest at the opposite ends of the genderedness spectrum, as authors with very feminine and masculine first names respectively get a lower and higher share of citations for every article published, irrespective of their contribution role.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Development Goals in Psychology: A Century of Progress in Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a lens for tracking societal change, yet contributions from the social and behavioral sciences have rarely been integrated into policy agendas. To take stock and create a baseline and benchmark for the future, we assemble 233,061 psychology publications (1894 -- 2022) and tag them to the 17 SDGs using a query-based classifier. Health, education, work, inequality, and gender dominate the study of SDGs in psychology, shifting from an early focus on work to education and inequality, and since the 1960s, health. United States-based research leads across most goals. Other countries set distinct priorities (e.g., China: education and work; Australia: health). Women comprise about one-third of authors, concentrated in social and health goals, but have been underrepresented in STEM-oriented goals. The 2015 launch of the SDGs marked a turning point: SDG-tagged publications have been receiving more citations than comparable non-SDG work, reversing a pre-2015 deficit. Tracking the SDGs through psychology clarifies long-run engagement with social priorities, identifies evidence gaps, and guides priorities to accelerate the field's contribution to the SDG agenda.</description>
