      <title>Gravitational renormalization group solutions and paticular effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the functional renormalization group equation and its solutions of the gravity having the background matters. From the system equivalence eliminating vacuum divergence, we are confirmed to give Newton coupling. We also give the path integral partition function technique to normalize setups of quantum corrected actions down to Einstein systems. Briefly, Einstein effective action and Stravinski effective action are come to the mass dependence with the appropriate cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>On brane systems with O${}^+$ planes -- 5d and 6d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Higgs branches of field theories with 8 supercharges in 5 and 6 dimensions, focusing on theories realised on 5-brane webs in Type IIB with an O$7^+$ plane, or a D6-D8-NS5 brane system in Type IIA in the presence of an O$8^+$ plane. We find magnetic quivers for the Higgs branches of these theories. The main consequence of the presence of the orientifold is that it renders the magnetic quiver to be non-simply-laced. We propose a contribution of the O$7^+$ to the usual stable intersection number of 5-branes from tropical geometry, and show that it is consistent with Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations of magnetic quivers which represent mass deformations of 5d SQFTs. From the magnetic quivers, we compute phase diagrams and highest weight generating functions for the Higgs branches, enabling us to identify the global form of the flavour symmetry for several families of 5d SQFTs; among them Bhardwaj's rank-1 theory. For 6d theories realised on a $-4$ curve, we observe the appearance of an additional $D_4$ slice on top of the phase diagram as one goes to the tensionless limit.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Quantum Particles in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>The $i\varepsilon$-Prescription for String Amplitudes and Regularized Modular Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integrals appearing in one-loop amplitudes in string theory, and in particular their analytic continuation based on a string theoretic analog of the $i\varepsilon$-prescription of quantum field theory. For various zero- and two-point one-loop amplitudes of both open and closed strings, we prove that this analytic continuation is equivalent to a regularization using generalized exponential integrals. Our approach provides exact expressions in terms of the degeneracies at each mass level. For one-loop amplitudes with boundaries, our result takes the form of a linear combination of three partition functions at different temperatures depending on a variable $T_0$, yet their sum is independent of this variable. The imaginary part of the amplitudes can be read off in closed form, while the real part is amenable to numerical evaluation. While the expressions are rather different, we demonstrate agreement of our approach with the contour put forward by Eberhardt-Mizera (2023) following the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher circle method.</description>

      <title>On Complexity and Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between complexity and duality in quantum systems, focusing on how local and non-local operators evolve under time evolution. We find that non-local operators, which are dual to local operators under specific mappings, exhibit behavior that mimics the growth of their local counterparts, particularly when considering state complexity. For the open transverse Ising model this leads to a neat organisation of the operator dynamics on either side of the duality, both consistent with growth expected in a quadratic fermion model like the Kitaev chain. When examing periodic chains, however, the mapping of boundary terms provides access to multiple branches of highly complex operators. These give rise to much larger saturation values of complexity for parity-mixing operators and are in contrast to what one would expect for a quadratic Hamiltonian. Our results shed light on the intricate relationship between non-locality, complexity growth, and duality in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Edge Modes in $p$-form Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our recently identified dynamical edge mode boundary condition to $p$-form gauge theories, revealing their edge modes as Goldstone bosons arising from gauge transformations with support on the boundary. The symplectic conjugates of these edge modes correspond to the electric-field-like components normal to the boundary. We demonstrate that both the symplectic form and the Hamiltonian naturally decompose into bulk and edge parts. When the boundary is a stretched horizon, we show that the thermal edge partition function reduces to that of a codimension-two ghost $(p-1)$-form residing on the bifurcation surface. These findings provide a dynamical framework that elucidates observations made by several authors. Additionally, we generalize Donnelly and Wall's non-dynamical approach to obtain edge partition functions for both massive and massless $p$-forms. In the context of a de Sitter static patch, these results are consistent with the edge partition functions found by several authors in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>$\mathfrak{hs}$-extended gravity from the IKKT matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate further on the one-loop effective action of the IKKT model on 3 + 1 dimensional covariant quantum spacetime in the presence of fuzzy extra dimensions. In particular, we describe the one-loop effective action in terms of a remarkable $SO(1, 9)$ character, which allows to evaluate the pertinent traces over the internal modes explicitly. This also allows to estimate the higher-order contributions (in the internal flux $\mathcal{F}_{\mathtt{IJ}}$) to the one-loop effective action in a systematic way. We show that all higher-order contributions are generally suppressed and UV finite, which justifies the previous treatment of the induced gravitational action. We also obtain explicit expressions for the effective Newton constant, and determine the dynamics of the Kaluza-Klein scale $\Delta_{\mathcal{K}}$ of the fuzzy extra dimensions $\mathcal{K}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic codes with fractal-like boundary erasures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the code properties of holographic fractal geometries initiated in \cite{Pastawski:2016qrs}. We study reconstruction wedges in $AdS_3/CFT_2$ for black hole backgrounds, which are in qualitative agreement with the vacuum-AdS approximation using generalized entanglement entropy in \cite{Bao:2022tgv}. In higher dimensions, we study reconstruction wedges for the infinite, straight strip in $AdS_{d+1}/CFT_{d}$ and clarify the roles of `straight' and `infinite' in their code properties. Lastly, we comment on uberholography from the perspective of complexity transfer and one-shot holography.</description>

      <title>Influence of field mass and acceleration on entanglement generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the entanglement dynamics of two detectors undergoing uniform acceleration and circular motion within a massive scalar field, while also investigating the influence of the anti-Unruh effect on entanglement harvesting. Contrary to the conventional understanding of the weak anti-Unruh effect, where entanglement typically increases, we observe that the maximum entanglement between detectors does not exhibit a strict monotonic dependence on detector acceleration. Particularly at low accelerations, fluctuations in the entanglement maxima show a strong correlation with fluctuations in detector transition rates.We also find that the maximum entanglement of detectors tends to increase with smaller field mass. Novelly, our findings indicate the absence of a strong anti-Unruh effect in (3+1)-dimensional massive scalar fields. Instead, thermal effects arising from acceleration contribute to a decrease in the detector entanglement maximum.</description>

      <title>Multivariate hypergeometric solutions of cosmological (dS) correlators by $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the analytic expression for homogeneous part of solutions of arbitrary tree-level cosmological correlators, including massive propagators and time-derivative interactions cases. The solutions are given in the form of multivariate hypergeometric functions. It is achieved by two step. Firstly, we indicate the factorization of the homogeneous part of solutions, i.e., the homogeneous part of solutions of multiple vertices is the product of the solutions of the single vertex. Secondly, we give the solution to the $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary single vertex integral family. We also show how to determine the boundary conditions for the differential equations. There are two techniques we developed for the computation. Firstly, we analytically solve $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations via power series expansion. Secondly, we handle degenerate multivariate poles in power series expansion of differential equations by blow-up. They could also be useful in the evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals in flat spacetime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear stability of global Anti-de Sitter space in the presence of multitrace deformations utilizing an Einstein-Klein-Gordon system with a top-down scalar potential. Our numerical simulations show that marginal and irrelevant deformations retain the nonlinear instability originally found by Bizo\'n and Rostworowski, while relevant deformations disrupt it. We show that the nonlinear impact of multitrace deformations is in one-to-one correspondence with how they affect the resonant character of the global Anti-de Sitter normal mode eigenfrequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18234v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories are the most general scalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and a single scalar field and its derivatives up to second order. They propagate only one scalar degree of freedom, without being plagued by Ostrogradsky instabilities. This is achieved through certain degeneracies of the functions forming their Lagrangian. They generalise the Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories. Originally proposed to describe the late-time acceleration of the expansion of the universe, generalising the cosmological constant, they can also be used to build models of the early universe, to describe inflation or alternatives to standard inflation. In the late universe, they modify the standard Vainstein screening mechanism from Horndeski theories (which can have observable consequences) and are suited to build black hole models, featuring non-stealth Kerr black hole solutions. In this work their phenomenology is reviewed, looking at their basic properties, their parameterisations and classifications, focusing on solutions in the early and the late universe and at cosmological and astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Kinematic censorship and high energy particle collisions in the Schwarzschild background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) for a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole embedded in Kiselev spacetime. By making small perturbations to the action and using WGC, we investigate the stability of black holes and predict the existence of lighter particles in the spectrum. Using the scattering of a charged scalar field, we study the WCCC. We verify under certain conditions on the temperature of the black hole, the second law holds for near-extremal black holes. Finally, we demonstrate that the WCCC holds for both extremal and near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores time-varying black holes within the framework of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields, examining the propagation of gravitational waves (GW). In reconstructed models, ghosts frequently emerge but can be eliminated by applying certain constraints. We investigate the behavior of high-frequency gravitational waves by examining the effects of varying Gauss-Bonnet coupling during their propagation. The speed of transmission is altered by the coupling in the creation of black holes. The speed of gravitational waves varies as they enter a black hole compared to when they exit.</description>

Abstract: An exact non-perturbative model of a gravitational wave with pure radiation is constructed. It is shown that the presence of dust matter in this model contradicts Einstein's field equations. Exact solution of Einstein equations for gravitational wave and pure radiation is obtained. The trajectories of propagation and characteristics of radiation are found. For the considered exact model of a gravitational wave, a retardet time equation for radiation is obtained. The obtained results are used to construct an exact model of gravitational wave and pure radiation for Bianchi type IV universe.</description>

      <title>The q-deformed Haldane-Shastry chain at q=i with even length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we announce some results extending our recent work with A. Toufik on the free-fermion point q=i of the Haldane-Shastry chain to the case with an even number N of sites. The resulting long-range version of the Heisenberg XX chain may be viewed as a model of fermions with extended gl(1|1) symmetry. Unlike for odd N, the conserved charges are nilpotent and exhibit Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>LHC EFT WG Note: Basis for Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we give a definitive basis for the dimension-eight operators leading to quartic -- but no cubic -- interactions among electroweak gauge bosons. These are often called anomalous quartic gauge couplings, or aQGCs. We distinguish in particular the CP-even ones from their CP-odd counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Stars have been recognized as optimal laboratories to probe axion properties. In the last decades there have been significant advances in this field due to a better modelling of stellar systems and accurate observational data.

      <title>Introduction to Thermal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article provides the basics and discusses some important applications of thermal field theory, namely the combination of statistical mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory. In a first part the fundamentals are covered: the density matrix, the corresponding averages and the treatment of fields of various spin in a medium. A second part is dedicated to the computation of thermal Green's function for scalars, vectors and fermions with path-integral methods. These functions play a crucial role in thermal field theory, as explained here. A more applicative part of the review is dedicated to the production of particles in a medium and to phase transitions in field theory, including the process of vacuum decay in a general theory featuring a first-order phase transition. To understand this review, the reader should only have a good knowledge of non-statistical quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Limits on Kaluza-Klein Portal Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phenomenology of dark-matter (DM) scenarios within radius-stabilized Randall-Sundrum models. Specifically, we consider models where the dark matter candidates are Standard Model (SM) singlets confined to the TeV brane and interact with the SM via spin-2 and spin-0 gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. We compute the thermal relic density of DM particles in these models by applying recent work showing that scattering amplitudes of massive spin-2 KK states involve an intricate cancellation between various diagrams. Considering the resulting DM abundance, collider searches, and the absence of a signal in direct DM detection experiments, we show that spin-2 KK portal DM models are highly constrained. We confirm that within the usual thermal freeze-out scenario, scalar dark matter models are essentially ruled out. In contrast, we show that fermion and vector dark matter models are viable in a region of parameter space in which dark matter annihilation through a KK graviton is resonant. Specifically, vector models are viable for dark matter masses ranging from 1.1 TeV to 5.5 TeV for theories in which the scale of couplings of the KK modes is of order 40 TeV or lower. Fermion dark matter models are viable for a similar mass region, but only for KK coupling scales of order 20 TeV. In this work, we provide a complete description of the calculations needed to arrive at these results and, in an appendix, a discussion of new KK-graviton couplings needed for the computations, which have not previously been discussed in the literature. Here, we focus on models in which the radion is light, and the back-reaction of the radion stabilization dynamics on the gravitational background can be neglected. The phenomenology of a model with a heavy radion and the consideration of the effects of the radion stabilization dynamics on the DM abundance are being addressed in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Evanescent Shadows -- Exploration of non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in Dimensional Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mathematical consistency of the BMHV scheme of dimensional regularisation (DReg) comes at the cost of requiring symmetry-restoring counterterms to cancel the regularisation-induced breaking of gauge and BRST invariance. There is no unique way to extend a 4-dimensional theory to $D$ dimensions, and different choices can be made for the dimensionally regularised fermions, evanescent parts of their kinetic terms and evanescent gauge interactions. Here we present a detailed study of the impact of changing such evanescent details. We leverage this freedom to identify a particularly convenient formulation that simplifies practical calculations. In order to thoroughly study the available options, we focus on a general abelian chiral gauge theory including scalar fields and adopt a general approach to the BMHV implementation. This allows for specialisation to various models and different approaches, including those from the literature. Importantly, our model can be specialised to the abelian sector of the Standard Model (SM). Consequently, this article also serves as a roadmap for upcoming applications to the full SM.</description>

      <title>Effects of position-dependent mass (PDM) on the bound-state solutions of a massive spin-0 particle subjected to the Yukawa potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, Klein and Gordon made the first attempt to elevate time to the status of a coordinate in the Schr\"odinger equation. In this study, we graphically discuss the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of the Klein-Gordon equation with a Yukawa-type potential (YP), within a position-dependent mass (PDM) framework. We conclude that the PDM leads to the equivalence of the positive ($E^+$) and negative ($E^-$) solution states at low energies. We observe that in the energy spectrum as a function of $\eta$ (YP intensity factor), the PDM can induce gap closure at the critical point where $E^+$ and $E^-$ become imaginary. In the spectrum as a function of $\alpha$ (YP shielding factor), it can compel the energies to be zero at $\alpha=0$, instead of being equal to $(m_0c^2)$ as in the invariant mass case.</description>

Abstract: We study the electroweak symmetry breaking in a five dimensional $Sp(6)$ gauge-Higgs unification model where the weak mixing angle is predicted to be $\sin^2 \theta_W=1/4$ at the compactification scale. We find that the correct pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking and a viable Higgs mass are realized by introducing a 4-rank totally symmetric representation and several adjoint fermions additionally.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations with the Non-Extensive Entropy Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in black hole thermodynamics have introduced corrections to elucidate the relationship between entropy and extremality bound of black holes. Traditionally, this relationship has been studied in the context of black holes characterized by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. However, this study extends the investigation to encompass non-extensive generalizations of entropy. We introduce a minor constant correction, denoted as $(\varepsilon)$, and examine the universal relations for a charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. Our findings indicate that these universal relations do not hold for the charged AdS black hole when described by the non-extensive generalizations of entropy. Of course, with some adjustments, the universality relations are met. In contrast, the universal relations remain compatible when the black hole is described by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultralight scalar dark matter couplings with the European Pulsar Timing Array second data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) offer an independent method for searching for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), whose wavelike nature induces periodic oscillations in the arrival times of radio pulses. In addition to this gravitational effect, the direct coupling between ULDM and ordinary matter results in pulsar spin fluctuations and reference clock shifts, leading to observable effects in PTAs. The second data release from the European PTA (EPTA) indicates that ULDM cannot account for all dark matter in the mass range $m_{\phi} \in [10^{-24.0}, 10^{-23.3}] \text{ eV}$ based solely on gravitational effects. In this work, we derive constraints on the coupling coefficients by considering both gravitational and coupling effects. Our results demonstrate that EPTA provides stronger constraints on these couplings than previous PTA experiments, and it establishes similar or even tighter constraints compared to other precise experiments, such as atomic clock experiments.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory for topological waves in continuum fluids with odd viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional continuum fluids with odd viscosity under a chiral body force. The chiral body force makes the low-energy excitation spectrum of the fluids gapped, and the odd viscosity allows us to introduce the first Chern number of each energy band in the fluids. Employing a mapping between hydrodynamic variables and U(1) gauge-field strengths, we derive a U(1) gauge theory for topologically nontrivial waves. The resulting U(1) gauge theory is given by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with an additional term associated with odd viscosity. We then solve the equations of motion for the gauge fields concretely in the presence of the boundary and find edge-mode solutions. We finally discuss the fate of bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) in the context of continuum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review delves into the pivotal primordial stage of the universe, a period that holds the key to understanding its current state. To fully grasp this epoch, it is essential to consider three fundamental domains of physics: gravity, particle physics, and thermodynamics. The thermal history of the universe recreates the extreme high-energy conditions that are critical for exploring the unification of the fundamental forces, making it a natural laboratory for high-energy physics. This thermal history also offers valuable insights into how the laws of thermodynamics have governed the evolution of the universe's constituents, shaping them into the forms we observe today. Focusing on the Standard Cosmological Model (SCM) and the Standard Model of Particles (SM), this paper provides an in-depth analysis of thermodynamics in the primordial universe. The structure of the study includes an introduction to the SCM and its strong ties to thermodynamic principles. It then explores equilibrium thermodynamics in the context of the expanding universe, followed by a detailed analysis of out-of-equilibrium phenomena that were pivotal in shaping key events during the early stages of the universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Semi-Symmetric Metric Gravity: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a review of the Semi-Symmetric Metric Gravity (SSMG) theory, representing a geometric extension of standard general relativity, based on a connection introduced by Friedmann and Schouten in 1924. The semi-symmetric connection is a connection that generalizes the Levi-Civita one, by allowing for the presence of a simple form of the torsion, described in terms of a torsion vector. The Einstein field equations are postulated to have the same form as in standard general relativity, thus relating the Einstein tensor constructed with the help of the semi-symmetric connection, with the energy-momentum tensor. The inclusion of the torsion contributions in the field equations has intriguing cosmological implications, particularly during the late-time evolution of the Universe. Presumably, these effects also dominate under high-energy conditions, and thus SSMG could potentially address unresolved issues in General Relativity and cosmology, such as the initial singularity, inflation, or the $^7$Li problem of the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. The explicit presence of torsion in the field equations leads to the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, which can be interpreted within the irreversible thermodynamics of open systems, as describing particle creation processes. We also review in detail the cosmological applications of the theory, and investigate the statistical tests for several models, by constraining the model parameters via comparison with several observational datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear response of a near-equilibrium charged relativistic gas in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational field in a generic stationary spacetime up to the second order of relaxation time and calculate the tensorial kinetic coefficients introduced by the presence of the strong electromagnetic and/or gravitational field. Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>Predicting New Above-Threshold Molecular States Via Triangular Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering that the experimentally observed molecular states are significantly fewer than those predicted theoretically, and that these states are traditionally classified as lying below thresholds while several candidates are found above them, we propose to broaden the definition of molecular states to include those that exist just above the thresholds. Identifying resonance peaks in invariant mass distributions and scattering cross-sections is crucial for probing these states, yet the mechanisms responsible for such enhancements remain unclear, complicating our understanding of new particle production. While the peaks linked to triangular singularities do not correspond to true hadronic states, the associated production mechanisms may provide valuable insight into the search for genuine hadrons. In this work, we propose employing the triangular singularity mechanism to theoretically investigate yet-to-be-observed molecular states, particularly those that could test heavy quark symmetry. We argue that these states may have true masses surpassing the thresholds of their constituent components, rather than being predicted to be below them by theoretical models. Our findings suggest the possible existence of 16 additional heavy quark molecular states, including $Y(4320)$, $Z(4430)$, and $\Upsilon(11020)$, which are posited to contain $D_1\bar{D}$, $D_1\bar{D}^{*}$, and $B_{s1}\bar{B}$ constituents, respectively.

      <title>Nonlinear Evolution of unstable Charged de Sitter Black Holes with Hyperboloidal Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the hyperboloidal framework, we research the dynamical process of charged de Sitter black holes scattered by a charged scalar field. From the linear perturbation analysis, with the coupling strength within a critical interval, the charged scalar field with a superradiance frequency can induce the instability of the system. To reveal the real-time dynamics of such an instability, the nonlinear numerical simulation is implemented. The results show that the scalar field grows exponentially in the early stages and drastically extracts the charge from the black hole due to the superradiance, analogous to the charged black hole in a closed system. Differently, after saturation, the scalar field can not coexist with the central black hole stably and dissipates beyond the cosmological horizon slowly, leaving behind a bald black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.04603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the three-loop beta functions of long-range multi-scalar models with general quartic interactions. The long-range nature of the models is encoded in a kinetic term with a Laplacian to the power $0&lt;\zeta&lt;1$, rendering the computation of Feynman diagrams much harder than in the usual short-range case ($\zeta=1$). As a consequence, previous results stopped at two loops, while six-loop results are available for short-range models. We push the renormalization group analysis to three loops, in an $\epsilon=4\zeta-d$ expansion at fixed dimension $d&lt;4$, extensively using the Mellin-Barnes representation of Feynman amplitudes in the Schwinger parametrization. We then specialize the beta functions to various models with different symmetry groups: $O(N)$, $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^N \rtimes S_N$, and $O(N)\times O(M)$. For such models, we compute the fixed points and critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Dynamical String Tension Theories with target space scale invariance SSB and restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.08875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string and brane tensions do not have to be put in by hand, they can be dynamically generated, as in the case when we formulate string and brane theories in the modified measure formalism. Then string and brane tensions appears, but as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . It can be seen however that these string or brane tensions are not universal, but rather each string and each brane generates its own tension, which can have a different value for each string or brane. There should be also a considerable effect for the effective gravity theories derived from these theories. We consider new background fields that can couple to these new types of extended objects, one of them, the tension scalar is capable of changing locally along the world sheet the value of the tension of the extended object. When many strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two strings probing the same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings, that have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equation determines the tension scalar. We also find that the construction of brane world scenarios in the context of these dynamical tension string theories, we discuss avoidance of the Hagedorn temperature possible relaxation of string swampland constraints in dynamical tension string theories, and that the dynamical string theories can bridge between the low and high energy quantum gravity effects, The dynamical modified string theory has target space scale invariance and this target space scale invariance can be restored at the points where the string tension approaches infinity. These models suggest the swampland constraints could be avoided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated from target space covariant formulations of topological sigma models and from a graded-geometric approach to higher gauge theory, we study connections on Lie and Courant algebroids and on their description as differential graded (dg) manifolds. We revisit the notion of basic curvature for a connection on a Lie algebroid, which measures its compatibility with the Lie bracket and it appears in the BV-BRST differential of 2D gauge theories such as (twisted) Poisson and Dirac sigma models. We define a basic curvature tensor for connections on Courant algebroids and we show that in the description of a Courant algebroid as a QP2 manifold it appears naturally as part of the homological vector field together with the Gualtieri torsion of an induced generalised connection. Furthermore, we consider connections on dg manifolds and revisit the structure of gauge transformations in the graded-geometric approach to higher gauge theories from a manifestly covariant perspective. We argue that it is governed by the brackets of a Kapranov L$_{\infty}[1]$ algebra, whose binary bracket is given by the Atiyah cocycle that measures the compatibility of the connection with the homological vector field. We also revisit some aspects of the derived bracket construction and show how to extend it to connections and tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a simple model for D-brane transport in non-abelian GLSMs. The model is the elliptic curve version of a non-abelian GLSM introduced by Hori and Tong and has gauge group U(2). It has two geometric phases, both of which describe the same elliptic curve, once realised as a codimension five complete intersection in G(2,5) and once as a determinantal variety. The determinantal phase is strongly coupled with unbroken SU(2). There are two singular points in the moduli space where the theory has a Coulomb branch. Using grade restriction rules, we show how to transport B-branes between the two phases along paths avoiding the singular points. With the help of the GLSM hemisphere partition function we compute analytic continuation matrices and monodromy matrices, confirming results obtained by different methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study twisted Courant sigma models, a class of topological field theories arising from the coupling of 3D 0-/2-form BF theory and Chern-Simons theory and containing a 4-form Wess-Zumino term. They are examples of theories featuring a nonlinearly open gauge algebra, where products of field equations appear in the commutator of gauge transformations, and they are reducible gauge systems. We determine the solution to the master equation using a technique, the BRST power finesse, that combines aspects of the AKSZ construction (which applies to the untwisted model) and the general BV-BRST formalism. This allows for a geometric interpretation of the BV coefficients in the interaction terms of the master action in terms of an induced generalised connection on a 4-form twisted (pre-)Courant algebroid, its Gualtieri torsion and the basic curvature tensor. It also produces a frame independent formulation of the model. We show, moreover, that the gauge fixed action is the sum of the classical one and a BRST commutator, as expected from a Schwarz type topological field theory.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for studying dynamics in QFT: it provides selection rules, constrains RG flows, and often simplifies analysis. Currently, our understanding is that the most general form of symmetry is described by categorical symmetries which can be realized via Symmetry TQFTs or ``SymTFTs." In this paper, we show how the framework of the SymTFT, which is understood for discrete symmetries (i.e. finite categorical symmetries), can be generalized to continuous symmetries. In addition to demonstrating how $U(1)$ global symmetries can be incorporated into the paradigm of the SymTFT, we apply our formalism to study cubic $U(1)$ anomalies in $4d$ QFTs, describe the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ non-invertible chiral symmetry in $4d$ theories, and conjecture the SymTFT for general continuous $G^{(0)}$ global symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive an infinite number of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

Abstract: We determine explicit expressions for the continuous two-sided gravitational wavefunctions in supersymmetric versions of JT gravity, focusing mainly on $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity. Our approach is based on representation theory of the associated supergroup, for which we determine the relevant mixed parabolic matrix elements that implement asymptotic AdS boundary conditions at the quantum level. We match our expressions with those found by solving the energy-eigenvalue equation of arXiv:2207.00408. We discuss gravitational applications by computing several amplitudes of interest, and address how our framework can be generalized further.</description>

      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>

      <title>Non-planar corrections in ABJM theory from quantum M2 branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization of semiclassical strings in AdS spacetimes yields predictions for the strong-coupling behaviour of the scaling dimensions of the corresponding operators in the planar limit of the dual gauge theory. Finding non-planar corrections requires computing string loops (corresponding to torus and higher genus surfaces), which is a challenging task. It turns out that in the case of the $U_k(N) \times U_{-k}(N)$ ABJM theory there is an alternative approach: one may semiclassically quantize M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ which are wrapped around the 11d circle of radius $1/k= \lambda/N$. Such M2 branes are the M-theory generalization of the strings in AdS$_4\times $CP$^3$. In this work, we show that by expanding in large M2 brane tension $ T_2 \sim \sqrt{kN} $ for fixed $k$, followed by an expansion in large $k$, we can predict the large $\lambda$ asymptotics of the non-planar corrections to the dimensions of the dual ABJM operators. As a specific example, we consider the M2 brane configuration that generalizes the long folded string with large spin in AdS$_4$, and compute the 1-loop correction to its energy. This calculation allows us to determine non-planar corrections to the universal scaling function or cusp anomalous dimension. We extend our analysis to the semiclassical M2 branes that generalize the "short" and "long" circular strings with two equal angular momenta in CP$^3$. The "short" M2 brane corresponds to a dual operator whose dimension at strong coupling scales as $\Delta \sim \lambda^{1/4} + \dots$, and we derive the leading non-planar correction to it.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an equivariant deformation of the $B$ model on the sphere with a $U(1)$-action. We present the deformed supersymmetry transformations and corresponding Lagrangians and study observables in the supercharge cohomology. The inclusion of equivariance allows for the introduction of novel, position-dependent observables on the sphere, which have no counterparts in the conventional $B$ model. Two specific cases we explore in detail are position-dependent superpotentials and complex structure deformations. In both instances, the theory exhibits notable differences from the standard $B$ model, revealing intriguing new features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-established that the dimensional reduction of the classical effective action of string theory at any order of $\alpha'$ on a circle of arbitrary radius remains invariant under the higher-derivative extension of Buscher transformations. In this study, we explore the extension of this symmetry to higher-genus levels. By leveraging the validity of Buscher rules for any genus of the world-sheet, we observe that the measure of the effective action remains invariant only when reduced on a self-dual circle. Our findings indicate that the invariance of the Lagrangian density under the higher-derivative extension of the corresponding restricted Buscher rules does not yield the one-loop effective action at order $\alpha'^3$ as derived by the S-matrix method.</description>

Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>

      <title>Three-loop helicity amplitudes for four-quark scattering in massless QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the three-loop corrections to the helicity amplitudes for $q\bar{q}\to Q\bar{Q}$ scattering in massless QCD. In the Lorentz decomposition of the scattering amplitude we avoid evanescent Lorentz structures and map the corresponding form factors directly to the physical helicity amplitudes. We reduce the amplitudes to master integrals and express them in terms of harmonic polylogarithms. The renormalised amplitudes exhibit infrared divergences of dipole and quadrupole type, as predicted by previous work on the infrared structure of multileg scattering amplitudes. We derive the finite remainders and present explicit results for all relevant partonic channels, both for equal and different quark flavours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an unconventional review article on spectral problems in black hole perturbation theory. Our purpose is to explain how to apply various known techniques in quantum mechanics to such spectral problems. The article includes analytical/numerical treatments, semiclassical perturbation theory, the (uniform) WKB method and useful mathematical tools: Borel summations, Pad\'e approximants, etc. The article is not comprehensive, but rather looks into a few examples from various points of view. The techniques in this article are widely applicable to many other examples.</description>

      <title>On the $\Delta_a$ invariants in non-perturbative complex Chern-Simons theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently a set of $q$-series invariants, labelled by $\operatorname{Spin}^c$ structures, for weakly negative definite plumbed $3$-manifolds called the $\widehat{Z}_a$ invariants were discovered by Gukov, Pei, Putrov and Vafa. The leading rational power of the $\widehat{Z}_a$ invariants are invariants themselves denoted by $\Delta_a$. In this paper we further analyze the structure of these $\Delta_a$ invariants. We review some of the foundations of the $\Delta_a$ invariants and analyze their structure for a subclass of integer homology spheres. In particular, we provide a complete description of the $\Delta_0$ invariants for Brieskorn spheres. Along the way we show that the $\Delta_a$ invariants are not homology cobordism invariants, thereby answering an open question in the literature.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Instability of Magnetic Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole superradiance has proven being very valuable in several realms of gravitational physics, and holds a promising discovery potential. In this paper, we consider the superradiant instability of magnetically-charged, rotating black holes and find a number of important differences with respect to neutral ones. Considering massive charged bosonic fields, we find that the instability timescale is much shorter, and this is true even if the black hole contains an order-one number of magnetic monopoles, or merely a single one, and possesses either low, moderate or large values of angular momentum. In particular, the instability is drastically faster than the radiative decay time of charged pions, potentially making it physically relevant. Furthermore, our analysis identifies the most unstable modes as a class of monopole spheroidal harmonics, that we dub north and south monopole modes, whose morphology is markedly different from the ones in standard superradiance since they extend along the rotational axis. For completeness, we also study the quasinormal mode spectrum and amplification factors of charged massless fields, finding no evidence of instabilities in that case.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the blackbody radiation problem in the presence of quantum gravity effects encoded in modified dispersion relations. The spectral radiance and the generalized Stefan-Boltzmann law are studied in this context. Furthermore, the regime of low temperatures is also contemplated, where features related to the blackbody thermal laws and the thermodynamic quantities such as energy, pressure, entropy, and specific heat are obtained. Possible implications in compact objects such as neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Renormalizable Cosmology Based on Gauss-Bonnet Theory with Torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on renormalizable cosmology based on the Gauss-Bonnet theory with torsion. Within the framework of renormalizable quantum field theory, we study the matter field containing the Gauss-Bonnet correction term. By modifying the gauge model, which includes a charged scalar field and two families of fermions, and introducing torsion and Gauss-Bonnet corrections, we analyze the field equations in the super-symmetric hybrid inflation model, investigate the properties of torsion in a flat universe, the characteristics of the energy-momentum tensor, and the sensitivity of the theoretical model to correction parameters. This study shows that the Gauss-Bonnet correction term can directly affect the Hubble constant through the Einstein equations, providing a new observational perspective. This paper proposes a cosmological model that can be adjusted according to different Gauss-Bonnet correction models, providing a theoretical reference for future observational verification of various Gauss-Bonnet models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study extensions of the mappings arising in usual channel-state duality to the case of Hilbert spaces with a direct sum structure. This setting arises in representations of algebras with centers, which are commonly associated with constraints, and it has many physical applications from quantum many-body theory to holography and quantum gravity. We establish that there is a general relationship between non-separability of the state and the isometric properties of the induced channel. We also provide a generalisation of our approach to algebras of trace-class operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions possesses several conserved quantum numbers, such as baryon number, strangeness, and electric charge. The diffusion process of these charges can be characterized by a diffusion matrix that describes the mutual influence of the diffusion of various charges. We derive the Kubo relations for evaluating diffusion coefficients as elements of a diffusion matrix. We further demonstrate that in the weak coupling limit, the diffusion matrix elements obtained through Kubo relations reduce to those obtained from kinetic theory with an appropriate identification of the relaxation times. We illustrate this evaluation in a toy model of two interacting scalar fields with two conserved charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with SU(2) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having collinear components, which do not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts -- (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the co-planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D SSH can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings from Tribrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a class of supersymmetric inflation models where the scalar component of a matter superfield, or a $D$-flat direction of matter fields, drives inflation. Similar to Hybrid inflation, the end of inflation is reached when a "waterfall field", which was stabilized during inflation at a field value where the scalar potential features a large vacuum energy, starts rapidly rolling towards its minimum where a symmetry group $G$ is spontaneously broken. In contrast to standard supersymmetric Hybrid inflation, where the inflaton is a gauge singlet, in Tribrid inflation it can be a gauge non-singlet, which, via its vacuum expectation value, already breaks the gauge symmetry. This raises the question whether topological defects can still form after inflation in this class of models, and if so, which types of defects are generated. We investigate this question systematically in realisations of Tribrid inflation where $G = U(1)$ and we analyse under which conditions cosmic strings form. We find that in the considered cases where domain walls form, these are only temporary and do not invalidate the model realisations. We also discuss how our results can be used to analyse models of Tribrid inflation associated with the final step of $SO(10)$ breaking, where cosmic strings can be metastable and provide a promising explanation of the recent PTA results hinting at a stochastic gravitational wave background at nanohertz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images on the back side of the ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional doped Dirac insulators foster simply connected (in both topological and trivial regimes) and annular (deep inside the topological regime) Fermi surfaces (FSs) in the normal state, and allow on-site repulsions among fermions with opposite spin ($U_1$) and parity ($U_2$) eigenvalues. From an unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled by a suitable $\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops a strong propensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar $p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions, respectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be pertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap semiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to investigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Interactions of the Cosmic Neutrino Background, Axions, Dark Matter, and Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we do three things. First, we outline the conditions under which the interaction rate of inelastic processes that change the internal state of a system of $N$ targets scales as $N^2$. This is an effect distinct from coherent elastic scattering, but with the same scaling. Second, we compute rates for such processes for various weakly interacting particles. Finally, we point to potential quantum observables for these processes, beyond energy exchange. Maximal coherence in inelastic processes is achieved when the targets are placed in an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. These coherent inelastic processes are analogous to Dicke superradiance, and we thus refer to them as superradiant interactions. We compute the superradiant interaction rates for the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B), dark matter scattering and absorption, and late-universe particles, such as reactor neutrinos, when the two-level system is realized by nuclear or electron spins in a magnetic field. The rates can be sizeable on macroscopic yet small targets. For example, the C$\nu$B interacts with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\text{Hz})$ when scattering off a 10~cm liquid or solid-state density spin-polarized sphere, a $\mathcal{O}(10^{21})$ enhancement compared to the incoherent contribution. For QCD axion dark matter, similar rates can be achieved with much smaller samples, $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{15})\left(\frac{m}{2\times 10^{-8}~\text{eV}}\right)^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the axion mass. Using the Lindblad formalism, we show that these superradiant interactions can manifest as a source of noise on the system. This points to new observables, sensitive to the sum of the excitation and de-excitation rates, and can be viewed as introducing diffusion and decoherence to the system. The effects presented in this paper may point to a new class of ultra-low threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? Electromagnetic and Gravitational Mode Mixing in NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of electromagnetic fields leaving imprints on gravitational wave (GW) signals from Neutron Star-Black hole (NSBH) mergers, specifically in the context of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) in the context of a minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell system, we demonstrate that electromagnetic quasi normal modes(QNMs) can excite gravitational QNMs with frequencies that are linear or quadratic in the electromagnetic QNMs, at first level of mixing. Moreover, We then study the electromagnetism-gravity coupling by approximating the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials with Dirac delta functions. In this example, we examine gravitational perturbations induced by the electromagnetic field of an ideal dipole radially free fall towards the blackhole, building on calculations from a companion paper [1]. Our results show that both linear and quadratic electromagnetic QNMs appear in gravitational perturbations. In addition, linear gravitational QNMs are also excited due to the electromagnetic source, with their amplitudes depending on the details of the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials, analogous to gravitational mode mixing analysis. Furthermore, at late stages, gravitational perturbations might exhibit polynomial tails induced by electromagnetic perturbations. This article sets the stage for future numerical investigations aimed at identifying such modes in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from quasielliptic compact binaries in scalar-tensor theory to one-and-a-half post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbit-averaged fluxes of energy and angular momentum generated by a compact binary system of nonspinning particles are obtained in a popular class of massless scalar-tensor theories with first-and-a-half post-Newtonian (1.5PN) accuracy, i.e., 2.5PN accuracy beyond the leading -1PN dipolar radiation. The secular evolution of the orbital elements (frequency and eccentricity) are then also obtained with 1.5PN accuracy. Three technical advances were necessary to obtain these results: (i) the decomposition of the scalar dipole moment as a Fourier series at 1PN order, along with the other moments at Newtonian order, (ii) the derivation of the formula for the passage to the center-of-mass frame at 2.5PN, including a novel hereditary term arising from the contribution of the radiation, and (iii) the complete treatment of the memory-like term appearing in the angular momentum flux. Moreover, as a byproduct of this work, I revisit in the Appendix the treatment in general relativity of the memory integral appearing at 2.5PN order in the angular momentum flux [arXiv:0908.3854], and find that the spurious divergence in the initial eccentricity $e_1$ found there is cured by a careful split between AC and DC terms.</description>

      <title>Testing Bell inequalities and probing quantum entanglement at CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum entanglement and test violation of Bell-type inequality at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), which is one of the most attractive future colliders. It's a promising particle collider designed to search new physics, make Standard Model (SM) precision measurements, and serving as a Higgs factory. Our study is based on a fast simulation of the $Z$ boson pair production from Higgs boson decay at $\sqrt{s} = 250$ GeV. The detector effects are also included in the simulation. The spin density matrix of the joint $ZZ$ system is parametrized using irreducible tensor operators and reconstructed from the spherical coordinates of the decay leptons. To test Bell inequalities, we construct observable quantities for the $H \to ZZ*$ process in CEPC by using the (Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu) CGLMP inequality, whose value is determined from the density matrix of the Z boson pairs. The sensitivity of the Bell inequality violation is observed with more than 1$\sigma$ and the presence of the quantum entanglement is probed with more than 2$\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Relativistic fluid dynamics in a 'hydro' frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate how field redefinition influences the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic fluid dynamics. We show that the hydrodynamic modes do not get affected under local field redefinition, whereas the non-hydrodynamic modes do. These non-hydrodynamic modes can be removed through a suitable all-order field redefinition. This process leads to a new frame containing only hydrodynamic modes, which we refer to as the hydro frame. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting stress-energy tensor may constitute an infinite series in momentum space, with the radius of convergence associated with the removed non-hydrodynamic mode, highlighting its role in the hydrodynamic expansion's validity.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in [1] on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>
