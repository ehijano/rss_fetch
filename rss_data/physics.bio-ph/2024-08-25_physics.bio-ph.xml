      <title>Thermodynamic inference of correlations in nonequilibrium collective dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of stochastic thermodynamics has revealed many useful fluctuation relations, with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) being a theorem of major interest. When many nonequilibrium currents interact with each other, a naive application of the TUR to an individual current can result in an apparent violation of the TUR bound. Here, we explore how such an apparent violation can be used to put a lower bound on the strength of correlations as well as the number of interacting currents in collective dynamics. Our proposed protocol allows for the inference of hidden correlations in experiment, for example when a team of molecular motors pulls on the same cargo but only one or a subset of them is fluorescently tagged. By solving analytically and numerically several models of many-body nonequilibrium dynamics, we ascertain under which conditions this strategy can be applied and the inferred bound on correlations becomes tight.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>
