      <title>Soliton solutions associated with the third-order ordinary linear differential operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit solutions to the related integrable nonlinear evolution equations are constructed by solving the inverse scattering problem in the reflectionless case for the third-order differential equation $d^3\psi/dx^3+Q\,d\psi/dx+P\psi=k^3\psi,$ where $P$ and $Q$ are the potentials in the Schwartz class and $k^3$ is the spectral parameter. The input data set used to solve the relevant inverse problem consists of the bound-state poles of a transmission coefficient and the corresponding bound-state dependency constants. Using the time-evolved dependency constants, explicit solutions to the related integrable evolution equations are obtained. In the special cases of the Sawada--Kotera equation, the Kaup--Kupershmidt equation, and the bad Boussinesq equation, the method presented here explains the physical origin of the constants appearing in the relevant $\mathbf N$-soliton solutions algebraically constructed, but without any physical insight, by the bilinear method of Hirota.</description>

      <title>The focusing complex mKdV equation with nonzero background: Large $N$-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons and related Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the large-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons of the focusing complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (c-mKdV) equation with nonzero background via the Riemann-Hilbert problems. First, based on the Lax pair, inverse scattering transform, and a series of deformations, we construct a multi-rational soliton of the c-mKdV equation via a solvable Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP). Then, through a scale transformation, we construct a RHP corresponding to the limit function which is a new solution of the c-mKdV equation in the rescaled variables $X,\,T$, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the RHP's solution. Moreover, we also find that the limit function satisfies the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to space $X$ and time $T$, respectively. The ODEs with respect to space $X$ are identified with certain members of the Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy. We study the large $X$ and transitional asymptotic behaviors of near-field limit solutions, and we provide some part results for the case of large $T$. These results will be useful to understand and apply the large-order rational solitons in the nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Symplectization of certain Hamiltonian systems in fibered almost-symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an important difference between Hamiltonian-like vector fields in an almost-symplectic manifold $(M,\sigma)$, compared to the standard case of a symplectic manifold: in the almost-symplectic case, a vector field such that the contraction iX{\sigma} is closed need not be a symmetry of $\sigma$. We thus call partially-Hamiltonian those vector fields which have the former property and fully-Hamiltonian those which have both properties. We consider 2n-dimensional almost symplectic manifolds with a fibration $\pi : M \longrightarrow B$ by Lagrangian tori. Trivially, all vertical partially-Hamiltonian vector fields are fully-Hamiltonian. We investigate the existence and the properties of non-vertical fully-Hamiltonian vector fields. We show that this class is non-empty, but under certain genericity conditions that involve the Fourier spectrum of their Hamiltonian, these vector fields reduce, under a (possibly only semi-globally defined, if $n \ge 4$) torus action, to families of standard symplectic-Hamiltonian vector fields.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetries, closed-form solutions, and conservation laws of a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lie-point symmetry method is used to find some closed-form solutions for a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials. The partial differential equation (PDE), which involves a power law with arbitrary exponent n, was investigated by Mason and his collaborators (Magan et al., Wave Motion, 77, 156-185, 2018). The Lie algebra for the model is five-dimensional for the shearing exponent n &gt; 0, and it includes translations in time, space, and displacement, as well as time-dependent changes in displacement and a scaling symmetry. Applying Lie's symmetry method, we compute the optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Using the subalgebras, several reductions and closed-form solutions for the model are obtained both for general exponent n and special case n = 1. Furthermore, it is shown that for general n &gt; 0 the model has interesting conservation laws which are computed with symbolic software using the scaling symmetry of the given PDE.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic geometry and wave-breaking phenomena in solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudospherical surfaces determined by Cauchy problems involving the Camassa-Holm equation are considered herein. We study how global solutions influence the corresponding surface, as well as we investigate two sorts of singularities of the metric: the first one is just when the co-frame of dual form is not linearly independent. The second sort of singularity is that arising from solutions blowing up. In particular, it is shown that the metric blows up if and only if the solution breaks in finite time.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into L parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. We show that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a fractal multipartite decomposition: it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction. Building upon this result, we then build exact, analytical tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of generalized Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>
