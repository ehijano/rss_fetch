      <title>Time-periodic driving of a bath-coupled open quantum gas of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the frequency-resolved density response of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a bath of dye molecules by time-periodic driving. By monitoring the photon number dynamics for different drive frequencies, we obtain the spectral response of the condensate in a phase-sensitive way. We find that as the photon number increases, the response of the coupled condensate-bath system transitions from overdamped to resonant behavior, indicating a transition from closed to open system dynamics. Our spectroscopy method paves the way for studies of collective excitations in complex driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Fermionic free energies from \textit{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations of fictitious identical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the recent $\eta-$ensemble path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach to the free energy [T.~Dornheim \textit{et al.}, \textit{Phys.~Rev.~B} \textbf{111}, L041114 (2025)] with a recent fictitious partition function technique based on inserting a continuous variable that interpolates between the bosonic and fermionic limits [Xiong and Xiong, \textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)] to deal with the fermion sign problem. As a practical example, we apply our set-up to the warm dense uniform electron gas over a broad range of densities and temperatures. We obtain accurate results for the exchange--correlation free energy down to half the Fermi temperature, and find excellent agreement with the state-of-the-art parametrization by Groth \textit{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)]. Our work opens up new avenues for the future study of a host of interacting Fermi-systems, including warm dense matter, ultracold atoms, and electrons in quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Emergence of coupled Korteweg-de Vries equations in $m$ fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is of fundamental importance in a wide range of subjects with generalization to multi-component systems relevant for multi-species fluids and cold atomic mixtures. We present a general framework in which a family of multi-component KdV (mKdV) equations naturally arises from a broader mathematical structure under reasonable assumptions on the nature of the nonlinear couplings. In particular, we derive a universal form for such a system of $m$ KdV equations that is parameterized by $m$ non-zero real numbers and two symmetric functions of those $m$ numbers. Secondly, we show that physically relevant setups such as $N\geq m+1$ multi-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (MNLS), under scaling and perturbative treatment, reduce to such a mKdV equation for a specific choice of the symmetric functions. The reduction from MNLS to mKdV requires one to be in a suitable parameter regime where the associated sound speeds are repeated. Hence, we connect the assumptions made in the derivation of mKdV system to physically interpretable assumptions for the MNLS equation. Lastly, our approach provides a systematic foundation for facilitating a natural emergence of multi-component partial differential equations starting from a general mathematical structure.</description>

      <title>CNN-Based Vortex Detection in Atomic 2D Bose Gases in the Presence of a Phononic Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum vortices play a crucial role in both equilibrium and dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) superfluid systems. Experimental detection of these excitations in 2D ultracold atomic gases typically involves examining density depletions in absorption images, however the presence of a significant phononic background renders the problem challenging, beyond the capability of simple algorithms or the human eye. Here, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect vortices in the presence of strong long- and intermediate-length scale density modulations in finite-temperature 2D Bose gases. We train the model on datasets obtained from ab initio Monte Carlo simulations using the classical-field method for density and phase fluctuations, and Gross-Pitaevskii simulation of realistic expansion dynamics. We use the model to analyze experimental images and benchmark its performance by comparing the results to the matter-wave interferometric detection of vortices, confirming the observed scaling of vortex density across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical point. The combination of a relevant simulation pipeline with machine-learning methods is a key development towards the comprehensive understanding of complex vortex-phonon dynamics in out-of-equilibrium 2D quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Local Measurements in Single-Parameter Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurement plays a crucial role in quantum metrology. Due to the limitations of experimental capabilities, collectively measuring multiple copies of probing systems can present significant challenges. Therefore, the concept of locality in quantum measurements must be considered. In this work, we investigate the possibility of achieving the Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound (QCRB) through local measurements (LM). We first demonstrate that if there exists a LM to saturate the QCRB for qubit systems, then we can construct another rank-1 local projective measurement to saturate the QCRB. In this sense, rank-1 local projective measurements are sufficient to analyze the problem of saturating the QCRB. For pure qubits, we propose two necessary and sufficient methods to determine whether and how a given parameter estimation model can achieve QCRB through LM. The first method, dubbed iterative matrix partition method (IMP) and based on unitary transformations that render the diagonal entries of a tracless matrix vanish, elucidates the underlying mathematical structure of LM as well as the local measurements with classical communications (LMCC), generalizing the result by [Zhou et al Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 025005 (2020)], which only holds for the later case. We clarify that the saturation of QCRB through LM for the GHZ-encoded states is actually due to the self-similar structure in this approach. The second method, dubbed hierarchy of orthogonality conditions (HOC) and based on the parametrization of rank-1 measurements for qubit systems, allows us to construct several examples of saturating QCRB, including the three-qubit W states and $N$-qubit W states ($N \geq 3$). Our findings offer insights into achieving optimal performance in quantum metrology when measurement resources are limited.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Black Hole perturbations in Acoustic Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonons in Bose-Einstein condensates propagate as massless scalar particles on top of an emergent acoustic metric. This hydrodynamics/gravity analogy can be exploited to realize acoustic black holes, featuring an event horizon that traps phonons. We show that by an appropriate external potential, gravitational wave-like perturbations of the acoustic metric can be produced. Such perturbations can be used to excite an acoustic black hole, which should then relax by phonon emission.</description>
