      <title>Formal Power Series Representations in Probability and Expected Utility Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advance a general theory of coherent preference that surrenders restrictions embodied in orthodox doctrine. This theory enjoys the property that any preference system admits extension to a complete system of preferences, provided it satisfies a certain coherence requirement analogous to the one de Finetti advanced for his foundations of probability. Unlike de Finetti's theory, the one we set forth requires neither transitivity nor Archimedeanness nor boundedness nor continuity of preference. This theory also enjoys the property that any complete preference system meeting the standard of coherence can be represented by utility in an ordered field extension of the reals. Representability by utility is a corollary of this paper's central result, which at once extends H\"older's Theorem and strengthens Hahn's Embedding Theorem.</description>

      <title>Zero Probability of the Cut Locus of a Fr\'echet Mean on a Riemannian Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the cut locus of a Fr\'echet mean of a random variable on a connected and complete Riemanian manifold has zero probability, a result known previously in special cases and conjectured in general. In application, we rule out stickiness, while providing examples of nowhere smooth Fr\'echet functions and we discuss extensions of the statement to Fr\'echet $p$-means, for $p\neq 2$, as well as to noncomplete manifolds and more general metric spaces.</description>

      <title>A Tokenized Sovereign Debt Conversion Mechanism for Dynamic Public Debt Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Tokenized Sovereign Debt Conversion Mechanism (TSDCM), a smart-contracted instrument that, upon meeting both debt-to-GDP and GDP-growth thresholds, automates the retirement of sovereign debt. TSDCM initiates the conversion of a portion of outstanding bonds into performance-linked tokens by integrating a two-state regime-switching jump-diffusion framework into decentralized protocols. We prove finite-time activation and expected debt reduction through new propositions, establish the existence and uniqueness of the underlying stochastic processes, and introduce a main theorem that ensures a strict decline in expected debt levels. With significant tail-risk mitigation, calibration using IMF data and MATLAB Monte Carlo simulations shows a 20-25% decrease in expected debt-to-GDP ratios over a ten-year period. A transparent and incentive-aligned route to sustainable sovereign debt management is provided by TSDCM.</description>

      <title>Regime-Aware Conditional Neural Processes with Multi-Criteria Decision Support for Operational Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work integrates Bayesian regime detection with conditional neural processes for 24-hour electricity price prediction in the German market. Our methodology integrates regime detection using a disentangled sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (DS-HDP-HMM) applied to daily electricity prices. Each identified regime is subsequently modeled by an independent conditional neural process (CNP), trained to learn localized mappings from input contexts to 24-dimensional hourly price trajectories, with final predictions computed as regime-weighted mixtures of these CNP outputs. We rigorously evaluate R-NP against deep neural networks (DNN) and Lasso estimated auto-regressive (LEAR) models by integrating their forecasts into diverse battery storage optimization frameworks, including price arbitrage, risk management, grid services, and cost minimization. This operational utility assessment revealed complex performance trade-offs: LEAR often yielded superior absolute profits or lower costs, while DNN showed exceptional optimality in specific cost-minimization contexts. Recognizing that raw prediction accuracy doesn't always translate to optimal operational outcomes, we employed TOPSIS as a comprehensive multi-criteria evaluation layer. Our TOPSIS analysis identified LEAR as the top-ranked model for 2021, but crucially, our proposed R-NP model emerged as the most balanced and preferred solution for 2021, 2022 and 2023.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For all $\alpha \in (0,1)$, we construct an explicit divergence-free vector field $V \in L^\infty([0,1],C^\alpha(\mathbb{T}^2))$ that exhibits universal anomalous (total) dissipation, accelerating dissipation enhancement, Richardson dispersion, anomalous regularization, and spatial intermittency. Additionally, we demonstrate the sharpness of the intermittent Obukhov-Corrsin regime for certain parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Anomalous free energy expansions of planar Coulomb gases: multi-component and conformal singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the partition function $$ Z_n = \int_{\mathbb{C}^n } \prod_{1 \le j&lt;k \le n} |z_{j}-z_{k}|^{2} \prod_{j=1}^{n} |z_j|^{2c}\, e^{-n V(z_{j})}\frac{d^{2}z_{j}}{\pi}, $$ where $c&gt;-1$ and $$ V(z)= |z|^{2d}-t(z^{d}+\overline{z}^{d}), \qquad t &gt;0, \, d \in \mathbb{N}. $$ The associated droplet reveals a topological phase transition: for $t &gt; 1/\sqrt{d}$, it consists of $d$ connected components; whereas for $t &lt; 1/\sqrt{d}$, it becomes simply connected and contains the origin, where a conformal singularity arises. In both regimes, we establish the asymptotic expansion $$ \log Z_n = C_1 n^2 + C_2 n \log n + C_3 n + C_4 \log n + C_5 + O(n^{-1}), $$ as $n \to \infty$, and derive all coefficients explicitly. In the multi-component regime $t &gt; 1/\sqrt{d}$, the constant term $C_5$ exhibits an oscillatory behaviour that depends on the congruence class of $n$ modulo $d$. In particular, in the special case $c = 0$ with $n$ divisible by $d$, our result confirms a conjecture of Dea\~no and Simm. In contrast, in the conformal singularity regime $t &lt; 1/\sqrt{d}$, the oscillatory behaviour disappears, while additional contributions in $C_4$ arise beyond the scope of the conjecture of Jancovici et al. As a special case $d = 1$, our result yields the asymptotic expansion for the moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre ensemble with finite exponent. In the bulk regime, we further derive the full expansion in powers of $1/N$, thereby providing a precise evaluation of the error term in the result of Webb and Wong.</description>

      <title>Constructive Disintegration and Conditional Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditioning, the central operation in Bayesian statistics, is formalised by the notion of disintegration of measures. However, due to the implicit nature of their definition, constructing disintegrations is often difficult. A folklore result in machine learning conflates the construction of a disintegration with the restriction of probability density functions onto the subset of events that are consistent with a given observation. We provide a comprehensive set of mathematical tools which can be used to construct disintegrations and apply these to find densities of disintegrations on differentiable manifolds. Using our results, we provide a disturbingly simple example in which the restricted density and the disintegration density drastically disagree. Motivated by applications in approximate Bayesian inference and Bayesian inverse problems, we further study the modes of disintegrations. We show that the recently introduced notion of a "conditional mode" does not coincide in general with the modes of the conditional measure obtained through disintegration, but rather the modes of the restricted measure. We also discuss the implications of the discrepancy between the two measures in practice, advocating for the utility of both approaches depending on the modelling context.</description>

      <title>Strong Laws of Large Numbers for Generalizations of Fr\'echet Mean Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fr\'echet mean of a random variable $Y$ with values in a metric space $(\mathcal Q, d)$ is an element of the metric space that minimizes $q \mapsto \mathbb E[d(Y,q)^2]$. This minimizer may be non-unique. We study strong laws of large numbers for sets of generalized Fr\'echet means. Following generalizations are considered: the minimizers of $\mathbb E[d(Y, q)^\alpha]$ for $\alpha &gt; 0$, the minimizers of $\mathbb E[H(d(Y, q))]$ for integrals $H$ of non-decreasing functions, and the minimizers of $\mathbb E[\mathfrak c(Y, q)]$ for a quite unrestricted class of cost functions $\mathfrak c$. We show convergence of empirical versions of these sets in outer limit and in one-sided Hausdorff distance. The derived results require only minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>$L^\infty$-optimal transport of anisotropic log-concave measures and exponential convergence in Fisher's infinitesimal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on the $L^\infty$-Wasserstein distance from optimal transport between strongly log-concave probability densities and log-Lipschitz perturbations. In the simplest setting, such a bound amounts to a transport-information inequality involving the $L^\infty$-Wasserstein metric and the relative $L^\infty$-Fisher information. We show that this inequality can be sharpened significantly in situations where the involved densities are anisotropic. Our proof is based on probabilistic techniques using Langevin dynamics. As an application of these results, we obtain sharp exponential rates of convergence in Fisher's infinitesimal model from quantitative genetics, generalising recent results by Calvez, Poyato, and Santambrogio in dimension 1 to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian universality for approximately polynomial functions of high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an invariance principle for polynomial functions of $n$ independent, high-dimensional random vectors, and also show that the obtained rates are nearly optimal. Both the dimension of the vectors and the degree of the polynomial are permitted to grow with $n$. Specifically, we obtain a finite sample upper bound for the error of approximation by a polynomial of Gaussians, measured in Kolmogorov distance, and extend it to functions that are approximately polynomial in a mean squared error sense. We give a corresponding lower bound that shows the invariance principle holds up to polynomial degree $o(\log n)$. The proof is constructive and adapts an asymmetrisation argument due to V. V. Senatov. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic normality via the fourth moment phenomenon of Nualart and Peccati. As applications, we obtain a higher-order delta method with possibly non-Gaussian limits, and generalise a number of known results on high-dimensional and infinite-order U-statistics, and on fluctuations of subgraph counts.</description>

      <title>A potential theory on weighted graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analog to classic potential theory on weighted graphs. With nodes partitioned into exterior, boundary and interior nodes and an appropriate decomposition of the Laplacian, we define discrete analogues to the trace operators, the single and double layer potential operators, and the boundary layer operators. As in the continuum, these operators can represent exterior or interior harmonic functions with different boundary conditions. The formalism we introduce includes a discrete Calder\'on calculus and brings some well known results from potential theory to weighted graphs, e.g. on the spectrum of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator. We illustrate the formalism with a cloaking strategy on weighted graphs which allows to hide an anomaly from the perspective of electrical measurements made away from the anomaly.</description>

Abstract: We study the favourite sites of a random walk evolving in a sparse random environment on the set of integers. The walker moves symmetrically apart from some randomly chosen sites where we impose random drift. We prove annealed limit theorems for the time the walk spends in its favourite sites in two cases. The first one, in which it is the distribution of the drift that determines the limiting behaviour of the walk, is a generalization of known results for a random walk in i.i.d. random environment. In the second case a new behaviour appears, caused by the sparsity of the environment.</description>

      <title>"All-Something-Nothing" Phase Transitions in Planted k-Factor Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of inferring a $k$-factor, specifically a spanning $k$-regular graph, planted within an Erdos--Renyi random graph $G(n,\lambda/n)$. We uncover an interesting "all-something-nothing" phase transition. Specifically, we show that as the average degree $\lambda$ surpasses the critical threshold of $1/k$, the inference problem undergoes a transition from almost exact recovery ("all" phase) to partial recovery ("something" phase). Moreover, as $\lambda$ tends to infinity, the accuracy of recovery diminishes to zero, leading to the onset of the "nothing" phase. This finding complements the recent result by Mossel, Niles-Weed, Sohn, Sun, and Zadik who established that for certain sufficiently dense graphs, the problem undergoes an "all-or-nothing" phase transition, jumping from near-perfect to near-zero recovery. In addition, we characterize the recovery accuracy of a linear-time iterative pruning algorithm and show that it achieves almost exact recovery when $\lambda &lt; 1/k$. A key component of our analysis is a two-step cycle construction: we first build trees through local neighborhood exploration and then connect them by sprinkling using reserved edges. Interestingly, for proving impossibility of almost exact recovery, we construct $\Theta(n)$ many small trees of size $\Theta(1)$, whereas for establishing the algorithmic lower bound, a single large tree of size $\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})$ suffices.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality of Projected Inventory Level Policies for Lost Sales Inventory Systems with Large Leadtime and Penalty Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the canonical periodic review lost sales inventory system with positive leadtime and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) demand under the average cost criterion. We demonstrate that the relative value function under the constant order policy satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equation. We employ ladder processes associated with a random walk featuring i.i.d. increments, to obtain an explicit solution for the relative value function. This solution can be expressed as a quadratic form and a term that grows sublinearly. Then we perform an approximate policy iteration step on the constant order policy and uniformly bound the gap relative to the otimal cost rate for large lead times. This leads to our main result that projected inventory level policies are asymptotically optimal as the leadtime grows when the cost of losing a sale is sufficiently large and demand has a finite second moment.</description>

Abstract: We describe the Coxeter permutahedra, recently studied by Ardila, Castillo, Eur and Postnikov, in terms of random Coxeter tournaments, which involve cooperative and solitaire games, as well as the usual competitive games in graph tournaments. In this way, we establish a Coxeter version of Moon's theorem on random tournaments. We present a geometric proof by the Mirsky--Thompson generalized Birkhoff's theorem, a probabilistic proof by Strassen's coupling theorem, and an algorithmic proof by a Coxeter analogue of the Havel--Hakimi algorithm. These proofs have interpretations in terms of players choosing competitors/collaborators with respect to relative weakness/strength. We also introduce a natural Coxeter analogue of the Bradley--Terry model, from the statistical theory of paired comparisons.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of Gaussian Neural Networks with ReLU activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for deep neural networks with Gaussian weights and at most linearly growing activation functions, such as ReLU. This generalises earlier work, in which bounded and continuous activation functions were considered. In practice, linearly growing activation functions such as ReLU are most commonly used. We furthermore simplify previous expressions for the rate function and provide a power-series expansions for the ReLU case.</description>

      <title>On the positivity of some weighted partial sums of a random multiplicative function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the papers by Angelo and Xu, Q.J Math., 74, pp. 767-777, and improvements by Kerr and Klurman, arXiv:2211.05540, we study the probability that the weighted sums of a Rademacher random multiplicative function, $\sum_{n\leq x}f(n)n^{-\sigma}$, are positive for all $x\geq x_\sigma\geq 1$ in the regime $\sigma\to1/2^+$. In a previous paper by Heap, Zhao and the author, and by the author, when $0\leq \sigma\leq 1/2$ this probability is zero. Here we give a positive lower bound for this probability depending on $x_\sigma$ that becomes large as $\sigma\to1/2^+$. The main inputs in our proofs are a maximal inequality based in relatively high moments for these partial sums combined with a Bonami--Hal\'asz's moment inequality, and also explicit estimates for the partial sums of non-negative multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Sharp Anti-Concentration Inequalities for Extremum Statistics via Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the pointwise concentration function of the maximum statistic of $d$ identically distributed real-valued random variables. Our first main result places no restrictions either on the common marginal law of the samples or on the copula describing their joint distribution. We show that, in general, strictly sublinear dependence of the concentration function on the dimension $d$ is not possible. We then introduce a new class of copulas, namely those with a convex diagonal section, and demonstrate that restricting to this class yields a sharper upper bound on the concentration function. This allows us to establish several new dimension-independent and poly-logarithmic-in-$d$ anti-concentration inequalities for a variety of marginal distributions under mild dependence assumptions. Our theory improves upon the best known results in certain special cases. Applications to high-dimensional statistical inference are presented, including a specific example pertaining to Gaussian mixture approximations for factor models, for which our main results lead to superior distributional guarantees.</description>

      <title>Volatility Modeling with Rough Paths: A Signature-Based Alternative to Classical Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two methodologies for calibrating implied volatility surfaces: a second-order asymptotic expansion method derived via Malliavin calculus, and a data-driven approach based on path signatures from rough path theory. The former, developed in Al\`os et al. (2015), yields efficient and accurate calibration formulas under the assumption that the asset price follows a Heston-type stochastic volatility model. The latter models volatility as a linear functional of the signature of a primary stochastic process, enabling a flexible approximation without requiring a specific parametric form.
  Our numerical experiments show that the signature-based method achieves calibration accuracy comparable to the asymptotic approach when the true dynamics are Heston. We then test the model in a more general setting where the asset follows a rough Bergomi volatility process-a regime beyond the scope of the asymptotic expansion-and show that the signature approach continues to deliver accurate results. These findings highlight the model-independence, robustness and adaptability of signature-based calibration methods in settings where volatility exhibits rough or non-Markovian features.</description>
