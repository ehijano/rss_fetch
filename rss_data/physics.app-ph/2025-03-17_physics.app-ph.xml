      <title>Scaffold-Assisted Window Junctions for Superconducting Qubit Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting qubit is one of the promising directions in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), which requires many high-quality qubits. To achieve this, it is desirable to leverage modern semiconductor industry technology to ensure quality, uniformity, and reproducibility. However, conventional Josephson junction fabrication relies mainly on resist-assistant double-angle evaporation, posing integration challenges. Here, we demonstrate a lift-off-free qubit fabrication that integrates seamlessly with existing industrial technologies. This method employs a silicon oxide (SiO$_2$) scaffold to define an etched window with a well-controlled size to form a Josephson junction. The SiO$_2$, which has a large dielectric loss, is etched away in the final step using vapor HF leaving little residue. This Window junction (WJ) process mitigates the degradation of qubit quality during fabrication and allows clean removal of the scaffold. The WJ process is validated by inspection and Josephson junction measurement. The scaffold removal process is verified by measuring the quality factor of the resonators. Furthermore, compared to scaffolds fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), qubits made by WJ through physical vapor deposition (PVD) achieve relaxation time up to $57\,\mu\text{s}$. Our results pave the way for a lift-off-free qubit fabrication process, designed to be compatible with modern foundry tools and capable of minimizing damage to the substrate and material surfaces.</description>

      <title>Advancing Electronics Manufacturing Using Dynamically Programmable Micro-Transfer Printing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-transfer printing is an assembly technology that enables large-scale integration of diverse materials and components from micro- to nano-scale, crucial for developing advanced electronic and photonic systems. However, traditional micro-transfer printing technologies lack dynamic selectivity, limiting capabilities in sorting and repairing materials and components for effective yield management during large-scale manufacturing and integration processes. In this work, we introduce a dynamically programmable micro-transfer printing system utilizing a sharp phase-changing polymer and an independently addressable microheater array to modulate adhesion through localized heating. The system demonstrates dynamically programmable capabilities for selective transfer of various materials including semiconductors, polymers and metals, handling geometries from micro-scale chiplets to nanometer-thick films and micro-spheres. It also exhibits exceptional capabilities in 3D stacking and heterogeneous materials integration, significantly advancing the manufacturability of complex electronics. As a demonstration, we successfully perform dynamically programmable transfer of microLED chips to create arbitrarily specified patterns, offering a promising solution to the challenges of mass transfer and pixel repair in microLED display manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Additive Manufacturing for Advanced Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum technology has opened up exciting opportunities to revolutionize computing and communication, timing and navigation systems, enable non-invasive imaging of the human body, and probe fundamental physics with unprecedented precision. Alongside these advancements has come an increase in experimental complexity and a correspondingly greater dependence on compact, efficient and reliable hardware. The drive to move quantum technologies from laboratory prototypes to portable, real-world instruments has incentivized miniaturization of experimental systems relating to a strong demand for smaller, more robust and less power-hungry quantum hardware and for increasingly specialized and intricate components. Additive manufacturing, already heralded as game-changing for many manufacturing sectors, is especially well-suited to this task owing to the comparatively large amount of design freedom it enables and its ability to produce intricate three-dimensional forms and specialized components. Herein we review work conducted to date on the application of additive manufacturing to quantum technologies, discuss the current state of the art in additive manufacturing in optics, optomechanics, magnetic components and vacuum equipment, and consider pathways for future advancement. We also give an overview of the research and application areas most likely to be impacted by the deployment of additive manufacturing techniques within the quantum technology sector.</description>

      <title>Thermal Capacity Mapping of Cryogenic Platforms for Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale cryogenic Input-Output (IO) infrastructure is a requirement for realising fault-tolerant quantum computing in solid-state modalities. Such IO scaling presents significant challenges in thermal modelling, hardware design and verification. Here we present a design tool for cryogenic platform development with applicability to quantum computing and other cryogenic technologies. By taking comprehensive measurements of a commercially available dilution refrigerator we construct a 'platform capacity map', quantifying the platform's complex response to heat loads distributed over multiple temperature stages and accounting for interstage dependencies, avoiding an analytical model. This allows for the modification of the platform parameters to be accurately estimated for the inclusion of an arbitrary IO infrastructure, the identification of stage thermal overheads and the optimisation of system parameters. We identify a key bottleneck around the Still stage, owing to loading from connected stages, and observe discrepancies between existing thermal modelling methods for estimating heat loads associated with IO and experimental results obtained from the platform capacity map.</description>

      <title>Memristive properties and synaptic plasticity in substituted pyridinium iodobismuthates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of organic cations in bismuth iodide complexes on their memristive behavior in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) type thin-layer devices. The presence of electron-donating and electron withdrawing functional groups (-CN, -CH3, -NH2, and -N(CH3)2) on pyridinium cations induces morphological alterations in crystals, thus influencing the electronic or ionic conductivity of devices comprising sandwiched thin layers (thickness = 200 nm +/-50) between glass/ITO as bottom electrode (~ 110 nm) and copper (~ 80 nm) as the top electrode. It was found that the current-voltage (I-V) scans of the devices reveal characteristic pinched hysteresis loops, a distinct signature of memristors. The working voltage windows are significantly influenced by both the types of cation and the dimensionality of ionic fragments (0D or 1D) in the solid-state form. Additionally, the temperature alters the surface area of the I-V loops by affecting resistive switching mechanisms, corresponding log-log plots at three temperatures (-30 {\deg}C, room temperature and 150 {\deg}C) are fully studied. Given that a memristor can operate as a single synapse without the need for programming, aligning with the requirements of neuromorphic computing, the study investigates long-term depression, potentiation, and spike-time-dependent plasticity-a specific form of the Hebbian learning rule-to mimic biologically synaptic plasticity. Different polar pulses, such as triangle, sawtooth, and square waveforms were employed to generate Hebbian learning rules. The research demonstrates how the shape of the applied pulse series, achieved by overlapping pre- and post-pulses at different time scales, in association with the composition and dimensionality of ionic fragments, lead to changes in the synaptic weight percentages of the devices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Continuum Robots with Reachability Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While multi-joint continuum robots are highly dexterous and flexible, designing an optimal robot can be challenging due to its kinematics involving curvatures. Hence, the current work presents a computational method developed to find optimal designs of continuum robots given reachability constraints. First, we leverage both forward and inverse kinematic computations to perform reachability analysis in an efficient yet accurate manner. While implementing inverse kinematics, we also integrate torque minimization at joints such that robot configurations with the minimum actuator torque required to reach a given workspace could be found. Lastly, we apply an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to find optimal robot dimensions while considering reachability, where the objective function could be the total length of the robot or the actuator torque required to operate the robot. Through three application problems, we show that the EDA is superior to a genetic algorithm (GA) in finding better solutions within a given number of iterations, as the objective values of the best solutions found by the EDA are 4-15\% lower than those found by the GA.</description>

      <title>Configuration Design of Mechanical Assemblies using an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm and Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A configuration design problem in mechanical engineering involves finding an optimal assembly of components and joints that realizes some desired performance criteria. Such a problem is a discrete, constrained, and black-box optimization problem. A novel method is developed to solve the problem by applying Bivariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (BMDA) and constraint programming (CP). BMDA is a type of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) that exploits the dependency knowledge learned between design variables without requiring too many fitness evaluations, which tend to be expensive for the current application. BMDA is extended with adaptive chi-square testing to identify dependencies and Gibbs sampling to generate new solutions. Also, repair operations based on CP are used to deal with infeasible solutions found during search. The method is applied to a vehicle suspension design problem and is found to be more effective in converging to good solutions than a genetic algorithm and other EDAs. These contributions are significant steps towards solving the difficult problem of configuration design in mechanical engineering with evolutionary computation.</description>

      <title>Direct Nucleation of Hierarchical Nanostructures on Plasmonic Fiber Optics Enables Enhanced SERS Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative fabrication method to achieve bottom-up in situ surface-overstructured Au nanoislands (NIs) with tunable grades of surface coverage, elongation, and branching, directly on micro-optical fibers for sensing applications. These all-in-gold hierarchical nanostructures consist of NIs coated with surface protrusions of various morphologies. They are created in solution using a selective seeded growth approach, whereby additional gold growth is achieved over Au NIs formerly developed on the fiber facet by a solid-state dewetting approach. The morphology of nanosized surface-NI overstructuring can be adjusted from multi-dot-decorated Au NIs to multi-arm-decorated Au NIs. This engineering of optical fibers allows for improved remote surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) molecular detection. By combining solid-state dewetting and wet-chemical approaches, we achieve stable in-contact deposition of surface-overstructured NIs with the optical fiber solid substrate, alongside precise control over branching morphology and anisotropy extent. The fiber optic probes engineered by surface-overstructured NIs exhibit outstanding sensing performance in an instant and through-fiber detection scheme, achieving a remarkable detection limit at 10-7 M for the R6G aqueous solution. These engineered probes demonstrate an improved detection limit by one order of magnitude and enhanced peak prominence compared to devices solely decorated with pristine NIs.</description>

      <title>Peak splitting and bias fields in ferroelectric hafnia mediated by interface charge effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pristine state of hafnium based ferroelectric devices exhibits various unwanted properties, such as imprint and peak splitting, which diminish with bipolar cycling. The incorporation of a niobium oxide layer at different positions in metal-ferroelectric-metal and metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal stacks is used to modify the pristine state of the device. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements are used to investigate the influence of niobium oxide on the zirconium hafnium oxide layer. It is hypothesized that the charged vacancies generated by the introduced niobium oxide in the adjacent zirconium hafnium oxide layer result in an electric bias field that influences the pristine polarization state of the domains. A comparison of different stacks shows that peak splitting in the pristine state is most likely related to the formation of opposing electric bias fields in upwards and downwards polarized domains. Furthermore, the incorporation of niobium oxide in the zirconium hafnium oxide/aluminum oxide capacitor stack in between the ferroelectric and insulating layer leads to a peak splitting free device without imprint, which could be explained by the increased influence of charge trapping near the zirconium hafnium oxide-/niobium oxide and niobium oxide-/aluminum oxide interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.02879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-increasing amount of data from ubiquitous smart devices fosters data-centric and cognitive algorithms. Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing. Finally, we discuss challenges and trends in realizing large-scale spintronic memristive systems for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on a low-loss coplanar lumped-element waveguide architecture. By employing open-stub capacitors and Manhattan-pattern junctions, our device achieves an insertion loss below 1 dB up to 12 GHz. We introduce windowed sinusoidal modulation for phase matching, demonstrating that smooth impedance transitions effectively suppress intrinsic gain ripples. Using Tukey-windowed modulation with 8 % impedance variation, we achieve 20$-$23-dB gain over 5-GHz bandwidth under ideal matching conditions. In a more practical circuit having impedance mismatches, the device maintains 17$-$20-dB gain over 4.8-GHz bandwidth with an added noise of 0.13 quanta above standard quantum limit at 20-dB gain and $-99$-dBm saturation power, while featuring zero to negative backward gain below the bandgap frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in 3D printing technology now enable the precise positioning of microscopic material voxels to form complex structures. Combined with emerging multi-material capabilities and printable responsive materials, this opens new possibilities for digital composite materials and 3D printing of shape-transforming structures, or 4D printing. Building upon these advancements, we devise a novel methodology for crafting digitized 4D-printed shape-transforming sheets. We 3D print responsive sheets composed of two layers, each consisting of active and passive voxels meticulously positioned to form thin structures that can be actuated on demand. Our approach solves a long-standing problem in the field, i.e., the independent and simultaneous programming of lateral geometry and reference curvature. This unprecedented control over the resulting shape unlocks new opportunities in synthetic shape-morphing materials, with potential applications in programmable mechanical properties and multi-material systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on Boiling of Nanofluids in Copper Foam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanofluids are suspensions of nanoscale particles (such as metals and their oxides) in base fluids (such as water, oil, or alcohol), which can significantly enhance the heat transfer performance of the base fluid. However, when nanofluids are applied to heat pipes, it is common for nanoparticles to accumulate within the heat pipe's capillary wick, clogging it and increasing thermal resistance. This paper investigates the phenomenon of boiling of water and nanofluids enhanced by copper foam through experimental methods. When the liquid is injected into copper foam placed on a heating plate, some of the liquid is squeezed out along the boundary of the heated surface of the copper foam during boiling. This phenomenon is independent of gravity but related to the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the heating surface. Based on these properties, we design a device to guide the squeezed-out liquid to other locations, offering a promising solution to the problem of nanoparticle accumulation in the heat pipe's capillary wick.</description>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has driven the demand for faster optical components in data centres to unprecedented levels. A key advancement in this field is the integration of multiple photonic components onto a single chip, enhancing the performance of optical transceivers. Here, silicon photonics, benefiting from mature fabrication processes, has gained prominence. The platform combines modulators, switches, photodetectors and low-loss waveguides on a single chip. However, emerging standards like 1600ZR+ potentially exceed the capabilities of silicon-based modulators. To address these limitations, thin-film lithium niobate has been proposed as an alternative to silicon photonics, offering a low voltage-length product and exceptional high-speed modulation properties. More recently, the first demonstrations of thin-film lithium tantalate circuits have emerged, addressing some of the disadvantages of lithium niobate enabling a reduced bias drift and enhanced resistance to optical damage. As such, making it a promising candidate for next-generation photonic platforms. However, a persistent drawback of such platforms is the lithium contamination, which complicates integration with CMOS fabrication processes. Here, we present for the first time the integration of lithium tantalate onto a silicon photonics chip. This integration is achieved without modifying the standard silicon photonics process design kit. Our device achieves low half-wave voltage (3.5 V), low insertion loss (2.9 dB) and high-speed operation (&gt; 70 GHz), paving the way for next-gen applications. By minimising lithium tantalate material use, our approach reduces costs while leveraging existing silicon photonics technology advancements, in particular supporting ultra-fast monolithic germanium photodetectors and established process design kits.</description>
