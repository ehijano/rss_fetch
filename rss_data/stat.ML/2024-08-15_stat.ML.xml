      <title>Alpha-Trimming: Locally Adaptive Tree Pruning for Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that adaptively controlling the size of individual regression trees in a random forest can improve predictive performance, contrary to the conventional wisdom that trees should be fully grown. A fast pruning algorithm, alpha-trimming, is proposed as an effective approach to pruning trees within a random forest, where more aggressive pruning is performed in regions with a low signal-to-noise ratio. The amount of overall pruning is controlled by adjusting the weight on an information criterion penalty as a tuning parameter, with the standard random forest being a special case of our alpha-trimmed random forest. A remarkable feature of alpha-trimming is that its tuning parameter can be adjusted without refitting the trees in the random forest once the trees have been fully grown once. In a benchmark suite of 46 example data sets, mean squared prediction error is often substantially lowered by using our pruning algorithm and is never substantially increased compared to a random forest with fully-grown trees at default parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Index Models with Neural Networks via Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-index models in high-dimensions using a two-layer neural network trained with the mean-field Langevin algorithm. Under mild distributional assumptions on the data, we characterize the effective dimension $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ that controls both sample and computational complexity by utilizing the adaptivity of neural networks to latent low-dimensional structures. When the data exhibit such a structure, $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ can be significantly smaller than the ambient dimension. We prove that the sample complexity grows almost linearly with $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$, bypassing the limitations of the information and generative exponents that appeared in recent analyses of gradient-based feature learning. On the other hand, the computational complexity may inevitably grow exponentially with $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in the worst-case scenario. Motivated by improving computational complexity, we take the first steps towards polynomial time convergence of the mean-field Langevin algorithm by investigating a setting where the weights are constrained to be on a compact manifold with positive Ricci curvature, such as the hypersphere. There, we study assumptions under which polynomial time convergence is achievable, whereas similar assumptions in the Euclidean setting lead to exponential time complexity.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Importance Sampling for Locally Stable Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding the expected value of a statistic of a locally stable point process in a bounded region is addressed. We propose an adaptive importance sampling for solving the problem. In our proposal, we restrict the importance point process to the family of homogeneous Poisson point processes, which enables us to generate quickly independent samples of the importance point process. The optimal intensity of the importance point process is found by applying the cross-entropy minimization method. In the proposed scheme, the expected value of the function and the optimal intensity are iteratively estimated in an adaptive manner. We show that the proposed estimator converges to the target value almost surely, and prove the asymptotic normality of it. We explain how to apply the proposed scheme to the estimation of the intensity of a stationary pairwise interaction point process. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared numerically with the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and the perfect sampling.</description>

      <title>Posterior Covariance Structures in Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the posterior covariance field in Gaussian processes, with applications to the posterior covariance matrix. The analysis is based on the Gaussian prior covariance but the approach also applies to other covariance kernels. Our geometric analysis reveals how the Gaussian kernel's bandwidth parameter and the spatial distribution of the observations influence the posterior covariance as well as the corresponding covariance matrix, enabling straightforward identification of areas with high or low covariance in magnitude. Drawing inspiration from the a posteriori error estimation techniques in adaptive finite element methods, we also propose several estimators to efficiently measure the absolute posterior covariance field, which can be used for efficient covariance matrix approximation and preconditioning. We conduct a wide range of experiments to illustrate our theoretical findings and their practical applications.</description>

      <title>Decoder ensembling for learned latent geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent space geometry provides a rigorous and empirically valuable framework for interacting with the latent variables of deep generative models. This approach reinterprets Euclidean latent spaces as Riemannian through a pull-back metric, allowing for a standard differential geometric analysis of the latent space. Unfortunately, data manifolds are generally compact and easily disconnected or filled with holes, suggesting a topological mismatch to the Euclidean latent space. The most established solution to this mismatch is to let uncertainty be a proxy for topology, but in neural network models, this is often realized through crude heuristics that lack principle and generally do not scale to high-dimensional representations. We propose using ensembles of decoders to capture model uncertainty and show how to easily compute geodesics on the associated expected manifold. Empirically, we find this simple and reliable, thereby coming one step closer to easy-to-use latent geometries.</description>

      <title>"How Big is Big Enough?" Adjusting Model Size in Continual Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many machine learning methods, creating a model requires setting a parameter that controls the model's capacity before training, e.g.~number of neurons in DNNs, or inducing points in GPs. Increasing capacity improves performance until all the information from the dataset is captured. After this point, computational cost keeps increasing, without improved performance. This leads to the question ``How big is big enough?'' We investigate this problem for Gaussian processes (single-layer neural networks) in continual learning. Here, data becomes available incrementally, and the final dataset size will therefore not be known before training, preventing the use of heuristics for setting the model size. We provide a method that automatically adjusts this, while maintaining near-optimal performance, and show that a single hyperparameter setting for our method performs well across datasets with a wide range of properties.</description>

      <title>Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning with High Dimensional Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the expected return of scalar rewards. Distributional RL (DRL), in contrast, studies the distribution of returns with the distributional Bellman operator in a Euclidean space, leading to highly flexible choices for utility. This paper establishes robust theoretical foundations for DRL. We prove the contraction property of the Bellman operator even when the reward space is an infinite-dimensional separable Banach space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the behavior of high- or infinite-dimensional returns can be effectively approximated using a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose a novel DRL algorithm that tackles problems which have been previously intractable using conventional reinforcement learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Neural Dynamics with Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the collective activity of neural populations relates to computation and ultimately behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Imbalanced Safety Data Using Extended Accident Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in using safety analytics and machine learning to support the prevention of workplace incidents, especially in high-risk industries like construction and trucking. Although existing safety analytics studies have made remarkable progress, they suffer from imbalanced datasets, a common problem in safety analytics, resulting in prediction inaccuracies. This can lead to management problems, e.g., incorrect resource allocation and improper interventions. To overcome the imbalanced data problem, we extend the theory of accident triangle to claim that the importance of data samples should be based on characteristics such as injury severity, accident frequency, and accident type. Thus, three oversampling methods are proposed based on assigning different weights to samples in the minority class. We find robust improvements among different machine learning algorithms. For the lack of open-source safety datasets, we are sharing three imbalanced datasets, e.g., a 9-year nationwide construction accident record dataset, and their corresponding codes.</description>

      <title>Joint Graph Rewiring and Feature Denoising via Spectral Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) take as input the graph structure and the feature vectors associated with the nodes. Both contain noisy information about the labels. Here we propose joint denoising and rewiring (JDR)--an algorithm to jointly denoise the graph structure and features, which can improve the performance of any downstream algorithm. We do this by defining and maximizing the alignment between the leading eigenspaces of graph and feature matrices. To approximately solve this computationally hard problem, we propose a heuristic that efficiently handles real-world graph datasets with many classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic data and real-world graph datasets. The results show that JDR consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on node classification tasks using GNNs as downstream models.</description>

      <title>Fast Unconstrained Optimization via Hessian Averaging and Adaptive Gradient Sampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider minimizing finite-sum and expectation objective functions via Hessian-averaging based subsampled Newton methods. These methods allow for gradient inexactness and have fixed per-iteration Hessian approximation costs. The recent work (Na et al. 2023) demonstrated that Hessian averaging can be utilized to achieve fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\tfrac{\log k}{k}}\right)$ local superlinear convergence for strongly convex functions in high probability, while maintaining fixed per-iteration Hessian costs. These methods, however, require gradient exactness and strong convexity, which poses challenges for their practical implementation. To address this concern we consider Hessian-averaged methods that allow gradient inexactness via norm condition based adaptive-sampling strategies. For the finite-sum problem we utilize deterministic sampling techniques which lead to global linear and sublinear convergence rates for strongly convex and nonconvex functions respectively. In this setting we are able to derive an improved deterministic local superlinear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\tfrac{1}{k}\right)$. For the %expected risk expectation problem we utilize stochastic sampling techniques, and derive global linear and sublinear rates for strongly convex and nonconvex functions, as well as a $\mathcal{O}\left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\right)$ local superlinear convergence rate, all in expectation. We present novel analysis techniques that differ from the previous probabilistic results. Additionally, we propose scalable and efficient variations of these methods via diagonal approximations and derive the novel diagonally-averaged Newton (Dan) method for large-scale problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the Hessian averaging not only helps with convergence, but can lead to state-of-the-art performance on difficult problems such as CIFAR100 classification with ResNets.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows of MMD Functionals with Distance Kernel and Cauchy Problems on Quantile Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a comprehensive description of Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals $\mathcal F_\nu := \text{MMD}_K^2(\cdot, \nu)$ towards given target measures $\nu$ on the real line, where we focus on the negative distance kernel $K(x,y) := -|x-y|$. In one dimension, the Wasserstein-2 space can be isometrically embedded into the cone $\mathcal C(0,1) \subset L_2(0,1)$ of quantile functions leading to a characterization of Wasserstein gradient flows via the solution of an associated Cauchy problem on $L_2(0,1)$. Based on the construction of an appropriate counterpart of $\mathcal F_\nu$ on $L_2(0,1)$ and its subdifferential, we provide a solution of the Cauchy problem. For discrete target measures $\nu$, this results in a piecewise linear solution formula. We prove invariance and smoothing properties of the flow on subsets of $\mathcal C(0,1)$. For certain $\mathcal F_\nu$-flows this implies that initial point measures instantly become absolutely continuous, and stay so over time. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the flow by various numerical examples using an implicit Euler scheme and demonstrate differences to the explicit Euler scheme, which is easier to compute, but comes with limited convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Protected Test-Time Adaptation via Online Entropy Matching: A Betting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for test-time adaptation via online self-training, consisting of two components. First, we introduce a statistical framework that detects distribution shifts in the classifier's entropy values obtained on a stream of unlabeled samples. Second, we devise an online adaptation mechanism that utilizes the evidence of distribution shifts captured by the detection tool to dynamically update the classifier's parameters. The resulting adaptation process drives the distribution of test entropy values obtained from the self-trained classifier to match those of the source domain, building invariance to distribution shifts. This approach departs from the conventional self-training method, which focuses on minimizing the classifier's entropy. Our approach combines concepts in betting martingales and online learning to form a detection tool capable of quickly reacting to distribution shifts. We then reveal a tight relation between our adaptation scheme and optimal transport, which forms the basis of our novel self-supervised loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves test-time accuracy under distribution shifts while maintaining accuracy and calibration in their absence, outperforming leading entropy minimization methods across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Measures on Lattices for High-Order Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional models reliant solely on pairwise associations often prove insufficient in capturing the complex statistical structure inherent in multivariate data. Yet existing methods for identifying information shared among groups of $d&gt;3$ variables are often intractable; asymmetric around a target variable; or unable to consider all factorisations of the joint probability distribution. Here, we present a framework that systematically derives high-order measures using lattice and operator function pairs, whereby the lattice captures the algebraic relational structure of the variables and the operator function computes measures over the lattice. We show that many existing information-theoretic high-order measures can be derived by using divergences as operator functions on sublattices of the partition lattice, thus preventing the accurate quantification of all interactions for $d&gt;3$. Similarly, we show that using the KL divergence as the operator function also leads to unwanted cancellation of interactions for $d&gt;3$. To characterise all interactions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg information defined on the full partition lattice using generalisations of the KL divergence as operator functions. We validate our results numerically on synthetic data, and illustrate the use of the Streitberg information through applications to stock market returns and neural electrophysiology data.</description>

      <title>Latent Anomaly Detection Through Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection framework that combines the robust statistical principles of density-estimation-based anomaly detection methods with the representation-learning capabilities of deep learning models. The method originated from this framework is presented in two different versions: a shallow approach employing a density-estimation model based on adaptive Fourier features and density matrices, and a deep approach that integrates an autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional representation of the data. By estimating the density of new samples, both methods are able to find normality scores. The methods can be seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end architecture and optimized using gradient-based optimization techniques. To evaluate their performance, extensive experiments were conducted on various benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that both versions of the method can achieve comparable or superior performance when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, the shallow approach performs better on datasets with fewer dimensions, while the autoencoder-based approach shows improved performance on datasets with higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion map particle system (DMPS) for generative modeling, based on diffusion maps and Laplacian-adjusted Wasserstein gradient descent (LAWGD). Diffusion maps are used to approximate the generator of the corresponding Langevin diffusion process from samples, and hence to learn the underlying data-generating manifold. On the other hand, LAWGD enables efficient sampling from the target distribution given a suitable choice of kernel, which we construct here via a spectral approximation of the generator, computed with diffusion maps. Our method requires no offline training and minimal tuning, and can outperform other approaches on data sets of moderate dimension.</description>

      <title>Community Detection Guarantees Using Embeddings Learned by Node2Vec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding the nodes of a large network into an Euclidean space is a common objective in modern machine learning, with a variety of tools available. These embeddings can then be used as features for tasks such as community detection/node clustering or link prediction, where they achieve state of the art performance. With the exception of spectral clustering methods, there is little theoretical understanding for commonly used approaches to learning embeddings. In this work we examine the theoretical properties of the embeddings learned by node2vec. Our main result shows that the use of $k$-means clustering on the embedding vectors produced by node2vec gives weakly consistent community recovery for the nodes in (degree corrected) stochastic block models. We also discuss the use of these embeddings for node and link prediction tasks. We demonstrate this result empirically, and examine how this relates to other embedding tools for network data.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Machine learning by Hybrid Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.09428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks (TN) have found a wide use in machine learning, and in particular, TN and deep learning bear striking similarities. In this work, we propose the quantum-classical hybrid tensor networks (HTN) which combine tensor networks with classical neural networks in a uniform deep learning framework to overcome the limitations of regular tensor networks in machine learning. We first analyze the limitations of regular tensor networks in the applications of machine learning involving the representation power and architecture scalability. We conclude that in fact the regular tensor networks are not competent to be the basic building blocks of deep learning. Then, we discuss the performance of HTN which overcome all the deficiency of regular tensor networks for machine learning. In this sense, we are able to train HTN in the deep learning way which is the standard combination of algorithms such as Back Propagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent. We finally provide two applicable cases to show the potential applications of HTN, including quantum states classification and quantum-classical autoencoder. These cases also demonstrate the great potentiality to design various HTN in deep learning way.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Treatment Effect Estimation in Semi-Supervised and High Dimensional Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to provide a general and complete understanding of semi-supervised (SS) causal inference for treatment effects. Specifically, we consider two such estimands: (a) the average treatment effect and (b) the quantile treatment effect, as prototype cases, in an SS setting, characterized by two available data sets: (i) a labeled data set of size $n$, providing observations for a response and a set of high dimensional covariates, as well as a binary treatment indicator; and (ii) an unlabeled data set of size $N$, much larger than $n$, but without the response observed. Using these two data sets, we develop a family of SS estimators which are ensured to be: (1) more robust and (2) more efficient than their supervised counterparts based on the labeled data set only. Beyond the 'standard' double robustness results (in terms of consistency) that can be achieved by supervised methods as well, we further establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of our SS estimators whenever the propensity score in the model is correctly specified, without requiring specific forms of the nuisance functions involved. Such an improvement of robustness arises from the use of the massive unlabeled data, so it is generally not attainable in a purely supervised setting. In addition, our estimators are shown to be semi-parametrically efficient as long as all the nuisance functions are correctly specified. Moreover, as an illustration of the nuisance estimators, we consider inverse-probability-weighting type kernel smoothing estimators involving unknown covariate transformation mechanisms, and establish in high dimensional scenarios novel results on their uniform convergence rates, which should be of independent interest. Numerical results on both simulated and real data validate the advantage of our methods over their supervised counterparts with respect to both robustness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Quantile Estimation: Robust and Efficient Inference in High Dimensional Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantile estimation in a semi-supervised setting, characterized by two available data sets: (i) a small or moderate sized labeled data set containing observations for a response and a set of possibly high dimensional covariates, and (ii) a much larger unlabeled data set where only the covariates are observed. We propose a family of semi-supervised estimators for the response quantile(s) based on the two data sets, to improve the estimation accuracy compared to the supervised estimator, i.e., the sample quantile from the labeled data. These estimators use a flexible imputation strategy applied to the estimating equation along with a debiasing step that allows for full robustness against misspecification of the imputation model. Further, a one-step update strategy is adopted to enable easy implementation of our method and handle the complexity from the non-linear nature of the quantile estimating equation. Under mild assumptions, our estimators are fully robust to the choice of the nuisance imputation model, in the sense of always maintaining root-n consistency and asymptotic normality, while having improved efficiency relative to the supervised estimator. They also attain semi-parametric optimality if the relation between the response and the covariates is correctly specified via the imputation model. As an illustration of estimating the nuisance imputation function, we consider kernel smoothing type estimators on lower dimensional and possibly estimated transformations of the high dimensional covariates, and we establish novel results on their uniform convergence rates in high dimensions, involving responses indexed by a function class and usage of dimension reduction techniques. These results may be of independent interest. Numerical results on both simulated and real data confirm our semi-supervised approach's improved performance, in terms of both estimation and inference.</description>

      <title>Convergence Error Analysis of Reflected Gradient Langevin Dynamics for Globally Optimizing Non-Convex Constrained Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient Langevin dynamics and a variety of its variants have attracted increasing attention owing to their convergence towards the global optimal solution, initially in the unconstrained convex framework while recently even in convex constrained non-convex problems. In the present work, we extend those frameworks to non-convex problems on a non-convex feasible region with a global optimization algorithm built upon reflected gradient Langevin dynamics and derive its convergence rates. By effectively making use of its reflection at the boundary in combination with the probabilistic representation for the Poisson equation with the Neumann boundary condition, we present promising convergence rates, particularly faster than the existing one for convex constrained non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Robustly estimating heterogeneity in factorial data using Rashomon Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many statistical analyses, in both observational data and randomized control trials, ask: how does the outcome of interest vary with combinations of observable covariates? How do various drug combinations affect health outcomes, or how does technology adoption depend on incentives and demographics? Our goal is to partition this factorial space into "pools" of covariate combinations where the outcome differs across the pools (but not within a pool). Existing approaches (i) search for a single "optimal" partition under assumptions about the association between covariates or (ii) sample from the entire set of possible partitions. Both these approaches ignore the reality that, especially with correlation structure in covariates, many ways to partition the covariate space may be statistically indistinguishable, despite very different implications for policy or science. We develop an alternative perspective, called Rashomon Partition Sets (RPSs). Each item in the RPS partitions the space of covariates using a tree-like geometry. RPSs incorporate all partitions that have posterior values near the maximum a posteriori partition, even if they offer substantively different explanations, and do so using a prior that makes no assumptions about associations between covariates. This prior is the $\ell_0$ prior, which we show is minimax optimal. Given the RPS we calculate the posterior of any measurable function of the feature effects vector on outcomes, conditional on being in the RPS. We also characterize approximation error relative to the entire posterior and provide bounds on the size of the RPS. Simulations demonstrate this framework allows for robust conclusions relative to conventional regularization techniques. We apply our method to three empirical settings: price effects on charitable giving, chromosomal structure (telomere length), and the introduction of microfinance.</description>

      <title>Wilsonian Renormalization of Neural Network Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the GP in which the data sets the IR scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and enable us to identify potential universality classes in these models.</description>

      <title>Breaking the $T^{2/3}$ Barrier for Sequential Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of probabilistic forecasts is calibrated if each prediction of the forecaster closely approximates the empirical distribution of outcomes on the subset of timesteps where that prediction was made. We study the fundamental problem of online calibrated forecasting of binary sequences, which was initially studied by Foster &amp; Vohra (1998). They derived an algorithm with $O(T^{2/3})$ calibration error after $T$ time steps, and showed a lower bound of $\Omega(T^{1/2})$. These bounds remained stagnant for two decades, until Qiao &amp; Valiant (2021) improved the lower bound to $\Omega(T^{0.528})$ by introducing a combinatorial game called sign preservation and showing that lower bounds for this game imply lower bounds for calibration.
  In this paper, we give the first improvement to the $O(T^{2/3})$ upper bound on calibration error of Foster &amp; Vohra. We do this by introducing a variant of Qiao &amp; Valiant's game that we call sign preservation with reuse (SPR). We prove that the relationship between SPR and calibrated forecasting is bidirectional: not only do lower bounds for SPR translate into lower bounds for calibration, but algorithms for SPR also translate into new algorithms for calibrated forecasting. We then give an improved \emph{upper bound} for the SPR game, which implies, via our equivalence, a forecasting algorithm with calibration error $O(T^{2/3 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, improving Foster &amp; Vohra's upper bound for the first time. Using similar ideas, we then prove a slightly stronger lower bound than that of Qiao &amp; Valiant, namely $\Omega(T^{0.54389})$. Our lower bound is obtained by an oblivious adversary, marking the first $\omega(T^{1/2})$ calibration lower bound for oblivious adversaries.</description>

      <title>Research on Autonomous Robots Navigation based on Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning continuously optimizes decision-making based on real-time feedback reward signals through continuous interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong adaptive and self-learning capabilities. In recent years, it has become one of the key methods to achieve autonomous navigation of robots. In this work, an autonomous robot navigation method based on reinforcement learning is introduced. We use the Deep Q Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) models to optimize the path planning and decision-making process through the continuous interaction between the robot and the environment, and the reward signals with real-time feedback. By combining the Q-value function with the deep neural network, deep Q network can handle high-dimensional state space, so as to realize path planning in complex environments. Proximal policy optimization is a strategy gradient-based method, which enables robots to explore and utilize environmental information more efficiently by optimizing policy functions. These methods not only improve the robot's navigation ability in the unknown environment, but also enhance its adaptive and self-learning capabilities. Through multiple training and simulation experiments, we have verified the effectiveness and robustness of these models in various complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Theorems for Trees and a General 'Private Learning Implies Online Learning' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work continues to investigate the link between differentially private (DP) and online learning. Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019) showed that for binary concept classes, DP learnability of a given class implies that it has a finite Littlestone dimension (equivalently, that it is online learnable). Their proof relies on a model-theoretic result by Hodges (1997), which demonstrates that any binary concept class with a large Littlestone dimension contains a large subclass of thresholds. In a follow-up work, Jung, Kim, and Tewari (2020) extended this proof to multiclass PAC learning with a bounded number of labels. Unfortunately, Hodges's result does not apply in other natural settings such as multiclass PAC learning with an unbounded label space, and PAC learning of partial concept classes.
  This naturally raises the question of whether DP learnability continues to imply online learnability in more general scenarios: indeed, Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (2021) explicitly leave it as an open question in the context of partial concept classes, and the same question is open in the general multiclass setting. In this work, we give a positive answer to these questions showing that for general classification tasks, DP learnability implies online learnability. Our proof reasons directly about Littlestone trees, without relying on thresholds. We achieve this by establishing several Ramsey-type theorems for trees, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Global Optimisation of Black-Box Functions with Generative Models in the Wasserstein Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new uncertainty estimator for gradient-free optimisation of black-box simulators using deep generative surrogate models. Optimisation of these simulators is especially challenging for stochastic simulators and higher dimensions. To address these issues, we utilise a deep generative surrogate approach to model the black box response for the entire parameter space. We then leverage this knowledge to estimate the proposed uncertainty based on the Wasserstein distance - the Wasserstein uncertainty. This approach is employed in a posterior agnostic gradient-free optimisation algorithm that minimises regret over the entire parameter space. A series of tests were conducted to demonstrate that our method is more robust to the shape of both the black box function and the stochastic response of the black box than state-of-the-art methods, such as efficient global optimisation with a deep Gaussian process surrogate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ubiquity of multiscale interactions in complex systems is well-recognized, with development and heredity serving as a prime example of how processes at different temporal scales influence one another. This work introduces a novel multiscale state-space model to explore the dynamic interplay between systems interacting across different time scales, with feedback between each scale. We propose a Bayesian learning framework to estimate unknown states by learning the unknown process noise covariances within this multiscale model. We develop a Particle Gibbs with Ancestor Sampling (PGAS) algorithm for inference and demonstrate through simulations the efficacy of our approach.</description>
