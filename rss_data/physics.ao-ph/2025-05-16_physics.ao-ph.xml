      <title>Assessing submesoscale sea surface height signals from the SWOT mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sea surface height (SSH) field measured by Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission's wide-swath altimeter is analyzed with a focus on submesoscale features. Along-track wavenumber spectra of SSH variance are estimated for the global ocean using the 1-day repeat period from March 26 to July 10, 2023. In regions with an energetic mesoscale eddy field, the spectra have a mesoscale plateau, a steep drop-off due to balanced submesoscale turbulence, and a much flatter power-law tail at small scales. These spectra are characterized by fitting a spectral model. For the balanced signal, this fit yields a spectral slope between -4 and -6 for most regions, consistent with expectations and previous observations. The amplitude of the distinct small-scale signal, which typically dominates at wavelengths less than 30 to 50km, is strongly correlated in time and space with the height of surface gravity waves, suggesting aliased wave signals as the most likely source. A simple method is proposed to isolate the balanced signal in regions with negligible internal tides. Maps of the balanced signal in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current show compact cyclones with geostrophic relative vorticities frequently in excess of the local planetary vorticity, challenging the quasi-geostrophic framework commonly used to interpret altimetric data.</description>

      <title>LanTu: Dynamics-Enhanced Deep Learning for Eddy-Resolving Ocean Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies dominate the spatiotemporal multiscale variability of the ocean, and their impact on the energy cascade of the global ocean cannot be ignored. Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting (especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for eddy-resolving ocean forecasting.</description>

      <title>Predicting Beyond Training Data via Extrapolation versus Translocation: AI Weather Models and Dubai's Unprecedented 2024 Rainfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models have transformed weather forecasting, but their skill for gray swan extreme events is unclear. Here, we analyze GraphCast and FuXi forecasts of the unprecedented 2024 Dubai storm, which had twice the training set's highest rainfall in that region. Remarkably, GraphCast accurately forecasts this event 8 days ahead. FuXi forecasts the event, but underestimates the rainfall, especially at long lead times. GraphCast's success stems from "translocation": learning from comparable/stronger dynamically similar events in other regions during training via global effective receptive fields. Evidence of "extrapolation" (learning from training set's weaker events) is not found. Even events within the global distribution's tail are poorly forecasted, which is not just due to data imbalance (generalization error) but also spectral bias (optimization error). These findings demonstrate the potential of AI models to forecast regional gray swans and opportunity to improve them through understanding the mechanisms behind their successes and limitations.</description>

      <title>Score-based diffusion nowcasting of GOES imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clouds and precipitation are important for understanding weather and climate. Simulating clouds and precipitation with traditional numerical weather prediction is challenging because of the sub-grid parameterizations required. Machine learning has been explored for forecasting clouds and precipitation, but early machine learning methods often created blurry forecasts. In this paper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero to three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and intuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for the community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting geostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our results show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation. These results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the past 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows the preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a conventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion models, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin on root mean squared error. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box ensemble generation, which shows skillful calibration, with the spread of the ensemble correlating well to the error.</description>

      <title>An AI-driven framework for the prediction of personalised health response to air pollution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, causing or exacerbating many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, climate change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework. We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world, user-generated data.</description>

      <title>Can AI weather models predict out-of-distribution gray swan tropical cyclones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that they are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather models and long-term climate emulators. An important open question is whether AI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI model FourCastNet on the 1979-2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category 3-5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet on 2018-2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category 3-5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3-5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin, suggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is encouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded in inputs. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather and climate models have similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other models. Other types of weather extremes need to be similarly investigated. Our work demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI models to reliably provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most impactful TCs, and, possibly, other weather extremes.</description>
