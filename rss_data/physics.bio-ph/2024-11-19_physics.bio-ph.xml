      <title>Non-classical scaling of strength with size in marine biological fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intriguing physical phenomena observed in natural materials have inspired the development of several engineering materials with dramatically improved performance. Marine sponge glass fibers, for instance, have attracted interest in recent decades. We tested the glass fibers in tension and observed that the strength of these fibers scales inversely with their size. While it is expected that the strength of a material scales inversely with its size, the scaling is generally believed to be inversely proportional to the square root of the specimen dimension. Interestingly, we found that the marine sponge glass fibers' strength scaled much faster, and was inversely proportional to the square of the specimen dimension. Such non-classical scaling is consistent with the experimental measurements and classical linear elastic fracture mechanics. We hypothesize that this enhanced scaling is due to the flaw size decreasing faster than the size of the specimen. The tensile strength, as a result of non-classical, higher-order scaling, reached a value as large as 1.5 GPa for the smallest diameter specimen. The manufacturing processes through which the spicules are made might hold important lesson for further enhancing the strength of engineering materials.</description>

      <title>Twin Peak Method for Estimating Tissue Viscoelasticity using Shear Wave Elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissue viscoelasticity is becoming an increasingly useful biomarker beyond elasticity and can theoretically be estimated using shear wave elastography (SWE), by inverting the propagation and attenuation characteristics of shear waves. Estimating viscosity is often more difficult than elasticity because attenuation, the main effect of viscosity, leads to poor signal-to-noise ratio of the shear wave motion. In the present work, we provide an alternative to existing methods of viscoelasticity estimation that is robust against noise. The method minimizes the difference between simulated and measured versions of two sets of peaks (twin peaks) in the frequency-wavenumber domain, obtained first by traversing through each frequency and then by traversing through each wavenumber. The slopes and deviation of the twin peaks are sensitive to elasticity and viscosity respectively, leading to the effectiveness of the proposed inversion algorithm for characterizing mechanical properties. This expected effectiveness is confirmed through in silico verification, followed by ex vivo validation and in vivo application, indicating that the proposed approach can be effectively used in accurately estimating viscoelasticity, thus potentially contributing to the development of enhanced biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cylindrical inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the depletion zone around the inclusions, thereby maximizing the overall entropy. We find that correlation blobs act as the basic units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the depletion zone formed above the inclusions can generate repulsion, partially offsetting the depletion attraction. Our study offers physical insights into the brush-induced depletion interaction and suggests it as a mechanism for protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <title>Integrated Ising Model with global inhibition for decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans and other organisms make decisions choosing between different options, with the aim to maximize the reward and minimize the cost. The main theoretical framework for modeling the decision-making process has been based on the highly successful drift-diffusion model, which is a simple tool for explaining many aspects of this process. However, new observations challenge this model. Recently, it was found that inhibitory tone increases during high cognitive load and situations of uncertainty, but the origin of this phenomenon is not understood. Motivated by this observation, we extend a recently developed model for decision making while animals move towards targets in real space. We introduce an integrated Ising-type model, that includes global inhibition, and use it to explore its role in decision-making. This model can explain how the brain may utilize inhibition to improve its decision-making accuracy. Compared to experimental results, this model suggests that the regime of the brain's decision-making activity is in proximity to a critical transition line between the ordered and disordered. Within the model, the critical region near the transition line has the advantageous property of enabling a significant decrease in error with a small increase in inhibition and also exhibits unique properties with respect to learning and memory decay.</description>

      <title>Consensus Statement on Brillouin Light Scattering Microscopy of Biological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) spectroscopy is a non-invasive, non-contact, label-free optical technique that can provide information on the mechanical properties of a material on the sub-micron scale. Over the last decade it has seen increased applications in the life sciences, driven by the observed significance of mechanical properties in biological processes, the realization of more sensitive BLS spectrometers and its extension to an imaging modality. As with other spectroscopic techniques, BLS measurements not only detect signals characteristic of the investigated sample, but also of the experimental apparatus, and can be significantly affected by measurement conditions. The aim of this consensus statement is to improve the comparability of BLS studies by providing reporting recommendations for the measured parameters and detailing common artifacts. Given that most BLS studies of biological matter are still at proof-of-concept stages and use different--often self-built--spectrometers, a consensus statement is particularly timely to assure unified advancement.</description>

      <title>Imaging neurotransmitter transport in live cells with stimulated Raman scattering microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical neurotransmission is central to neurotypical brain function but also implicated in a variety of psychiatric neurodegenerative diseases. The release dynamics of neurotransmitters is correlated with but distinct from neuronal electrical signal propagation. It is therefore necessary to track neurotransmitter modulation separately from neuron electrical activity. Here, we present a new approach for imaging deuterated neurotransmitter molecules with stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. Using SRS microscopy, we perform direct imaging of deuterated dopamine and GABA in PC12 chromaffin cells, and in primary hippocampal neurons, respectively, based on the carbon-deuterium vibrational frequencies. We demonstrate that SRS imaging of these isotopologues directly visualizes intracellular neurotransmitters without changing the neurotransmitters' chemical identity and requiring custom synthesis or genetic encoding protocols. We further show that stimulation of neurotransmitter release results in an overall 20-50 percent intracellular neurotransmitter signal reduction, in agreement with comparable neurotransmission dynamics studies, with the ability to observe inter- and intracellular variation in vesicular neurotransmitter release. Taken together, our data suggest that neurotransmitter isotopologues can serve as a commercially-available, biocompatible, and generalizable method to image neurotransmitters with deuterated molecules that are virtually chemically identical to their native counterparts.</description>

      <title>Integrating GNN and Neural ODEs for Estimating Non-Reciprocal Two-Body Interactions in Mixed-Species Collective Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing the motion of multiple biological agents, be it cells or individual animals, is pivotal for the understanding of complex collective behaviors. With the advent of advanced microscopy, detailed images of complex tissue formations involving multiple cell types have become more accessible in recent years. However, deciphering the underlying rules that govern cell movements is far from trivial. Here, we present a novel deep learning framework for estimating the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model with non-reciprocal forces that mimic the collective dynamics of the cells of slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the functional forms of two-body interactions -- even when they are nonreciprocal -- thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical removal of antibiotics and multidrug-resistant bacteria using S-functionalized graphene sponge electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we synthesized S functionalized graphene sponge electrode and applied it for electrochemical oxidation of five commonly used antibiotics, namely sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, roxithromycin and erythromycin, and inactivation of a multidrug resistant Escherichia coli, E. coli. The experiments were performed using real drinking water in a flow through, one pass mode. Highly polar antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole did not adsorb onto the graphene sponge but were completely removed, i.e., more than 95% removal, at low applied current densities, 14.5 A m2. Antibiotics with high affinity for pi pi interactions were completely removed already in the open circuit, and current application led to their further degradation. S doped graphene sponge anode resulted in 4.5 log removal of a multi-drug resistant E. coli at 29 A m2. There was no regrowth of bacteria observed during storage of the electrochemically treated samples, suggesting that the treatment severely impacted the cell viability. Further E. coli removal of 0.7 log was observed after the storage of electrochemically treated samples. The energy consumption of a continuously operated electrochemical system that achieved 4.5 log inactivation of a multidrug resistant E. coli and 87 to 99% removal of antibiotics was 1.1 kWh m3.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficiency Constraint for Chemical Motors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical movement driven by chemical gradients provides the primordial energy for biological functions. Its thermodynamic properties remains inclusive, especially for a dynamical change of energy demand in biological systems. In this article, we obtain a constraint relation between the changing output power and the conversion efficiency for a chemically fuelled rotary motor analogous to the $\mathrm{F}_{0}$-motor of ATPase. We find the efficiency at maximum power is half of the maximum quasi-static efficiency. These findings shall aid in the understanding of natural chemical engines and inspire the manual design and control of chemically fuelled microscale engines.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>
