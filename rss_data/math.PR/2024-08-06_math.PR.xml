      <title>Tightness for branching random walk in a space-inhomogeneous random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the maximum $M_t$ of branching random walk in a space-inhomogeneous random environment on $\mathbb{Z}$. In this model the branching rate while at some location $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ is randomized in an i.i.d.\@ manner. We prove that there is a centering $\widetilde{m}_t$ depending only on the environment such that $(M_t-\widetilde{m}_t)_{t\ge 0}$ is tight in an annealed sense.</description>

      <title>Fractal opinions among interacting agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an opinion model consisting of a large group of interacting agents, whose opinions are represented as numbers in $[-1,1]$. At each update time, two random agents are selected, and the opinion of the first agent is updated based on the opinion of the second (the ``persuader''). We derive the mean-field kinetic equation describing the large population limit of the model, and we provide several quantitative results establishing convergence to the unique equilibrium distribution. Surprisingly, in some range of the model parameters, the support of the equilibrium distribution exhibits a fractal structure. This provides a new mathematical description for the so-called opinion fragmentation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On a planar random motion with asymptotically correlated components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a planar random motion $\big(X(t),\,Y(t)\big)$ with orthogonal directions, where the direction switches are governed by a homogeneous Poisson process. At each Poisson event, the moving particle turns clockwise or counterclockwise according to a rule which depends on the current direction. We prove that the components of the vector $\big(X(t),\,Y(t)\big)$ can be represented as linear combinations of two independent telegraph processes with different intensities. The exact distribution of $\big(X(t),\,Y(t)\big)$ is then obtained both in the interior of the support and on its boundary, where a singular component is present. We show that, in the hydrodynamic limit, the process behaves as a planar Brownian motion with correlated components. The distribution of the time spent by the process moving vertically is then studied. We obtain its exact distribution and discuss its hydrodynamic limit. In particular, in the limiting case, the process $\big(X(t),\,Y(t)\big)$ spends half of the time moving vertically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal control of path-dependent piecewise deterministic processes. An appropriate dynamic programming principle is established. We prove that the associated value function is the unique minimax solution of the corresponding non-local path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This is the first well-posedness result for nonsmooth solutions of fully nonlinear non-local path-dependent partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Proof of off-diagonal long-range order in a mean-field trapped Bose gas via the Feynman--Kac formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the non-interacting Bose gas of $N$ bosons in dimension $d\geq 3$ in a trap in a mean-field setting with a vanishing factor $a_N$ in front of the kinetic energy. The choice $a_N=N^{-2/d}$ is the semi-classical setting and was analysed in great detail in a special, interacting case in Deuchert and Seiringer (2021). Using a version of the well-known Feynman--Kac representation and a further representation in terms of a Poisson point process, we derive precise asymptotics for the reduced one-particle density matrix, implying off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO, a well-known criterion for Bose--Einstein condensation) for $a_N$ above a certain threshold and non-occurrence of ODLRO for $a_N$ below that threshold. In particular, we relate the condensate and its total mass to the amount of particles in long loops in the Feynman--Kac formula, the order parameter that Feynman suggested in Feynman (1953). For $a_N\ll N^{-2/d}$, we prove that all loops have the minimal length one, and for $a_N\gg N^{-2/d}$ we prove 100 percent condensation and identify the distribution of the long-loop lengths as the Poisson--Dirichlet distribution.</description>

      <title>Potential Hessian Ascent: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first iterative spectral algorithm to find near-optima of a random quadratic objective over the discrete hypercube. The algorithm is a randomized Hessian ascent in the solid cube, where we modify the objective by subtracting a specific instance-independent potential function [Chen et al., Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 76(7), 2023]. This extends Subag's algorithmic program of Hessian ascent from the sphere [Subag, Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 74(5), 2021] to the more complex geometry of the cube.
  Utilizing tools from free probability theory, we construct an approximate projector into the top-eigenspaces of the Hessian with well-behaved diagonal entries, and use it as the covariance matrix for the random increments. With high probability, the empirical distribution of the iterates approximates the solution to the primal version of the Auffinger-Chen SDE [Auffinger et al., Communications in Mathematical Physics, 335, 2015]. We then bound the change to the modified objective function for every iterate via a Taylor expansion whose derivatives are controlled using various Gaussian concentration bounds and smoothness properties of (a semiconcave regularization of) the Fenchel-Legendre dual to the solution of the Parisi PDE.
  These results lay the groundwork for demonstrating the (possible) existence of low-degree sum-of-squares certificates over high-entropy step distributions for a relaxed version of the Parisi formula [Open Question 1.8, arXiv:2401.14383].</description>

      <title>Long-time behaviour of a multidimensional age-dependent branching process with a singular jump kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the  ergodic behaviour of a multidimensional age-dependent branching process with a singular jump kernel, motivated by studying the phenomenon of telomere shortening in cell populations. Our model tracks individuals evolving within a continuous-time framework indexed by a binary tree, characterised by age and a multidimensional trait. Branching events occur with rates dependent on age, where offspring inherit traits from their parent with random  increase or decrease in some coordinates, while the most of them are left unchanged. Exponential ergodicity is obtained at the cost of an exponential normalisation, despite the fact that we have an unbounded age-dependent birth rate that may depend on the multidimensional trait, and a non-compact transition kernel. These two difficulties are respectively treated by stochastically comparing our model to Bellman-Harris processes, and by using a weak form of a Harnack inequality. We conclude this study by giving examples where the assumptions of our main result are verified.</description>

      <title>Classifying the Concentration of the Boolean Cube for Dependent Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02540v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A metric probability space $(\Omega,d)$ obeys the ${\it concentration\; of\; measure\; phenomenon}$ if subsets of measure $1/2$ enlarge to subsets of measure close to 1 as a transition parameter $\epsilon$ approaches a limit. In this paper we consider the concentration of the space itself, namely the concentration of the metric $d(x,y)$ for a fixed $y\in \Omega$. For any $y\in \Omega$, the concentration of $d(x,y)$ is guaranteed for product distributions in high dimensions $n$, as $d(x,y)$ is a Lipschitz function in $x$. In fact, in the product setting, the rate at which the metric concentrates is of the same order in $n$ for any fixed $y\in \Omega$. The same thing, however, cannot be said for certain dependent (non-product) distributions. For the Boolean cube $I_n$ (a widely analyzed simple model), we show that, for any dependent distribution, the rate of concentration of the Hamming distance $d_H(x,y)$, for a fixed $y$, depends on the choice of $y\in I_n$, and on the variance of the conditional distributions $\mu(x_k \mid x_1,\dots, x_{k-1})$, $2\leq k\leq n$. We give an inductive bound which holds for all probability distributions on the Boolean cube, and characterize the quality of concentration by a certain positive (negative) correlation condition. Our method of proof is advantageous in that it is both simple and comprehensive. We consider uniform bounding techniques when the variance of the conditional distributions is negligible, and show how this basic technique applies to the concentration of the entire class of Lipschitz functions on the Boolean cube.</description>

      <title>Stochastic bifurcation of a three-dimensional stochastic Kolmogorov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we systematically investigate the stochastic bifurcations of both ergodic stationary measures and global dynamics for stochastic Kolmogorov differential systems, which relate closely to the change of the sign of Lyapunov exponents. It is derived that there exists a threshold $\sigma_0$ such that, if the noise intensity $\sigma \geq\sigma_0$, the noise destroys all bifurcations of the deterministic system and the corresponding stochastic Kolmogorov system is uniquely ergodic. On the other hand, when the noise intensity $\sigma&lt;\sigma_0$, the stochastic system undergoes bifurcations from the unique ergodic stationary measure to three different types of ergodic stationary measures: (I) finitely many ergodic measures supported on rays, (II) infinitely many ergodic measures supported on rays, (III) infinitely many ergodic measures supported on invariant cones. Correspondingly, the global dynamics undergo similar bifurcation phenomena, which even displays infinitely many Crauel random periodic solutions in the sense of \cite{ELR21}. Furthermore, we prove that as $\sigma$ tends to zero, the ergodic stationary measures converge to either Dirac measures supported on equilibria, or to Haar measures supported on non-trivial deterministic periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Meta-Posterior Consistency for the Bayesian Inference of Metastable System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of the literature on learning dynamical systems or stochastic processes from time series has focused on stable or ergodic systems, for both Bayesian and frequentist inference procedures. However, most real-world systems are only metastable, that is, the dynamics appear to be stable on some time scale, but are in fact unstable over longer time scales. Consistency of inference for metastable systems may not be possible, but one can ask about metaconsistency: Do inference procedures converge when observations are taken over a large but finite time interval, but diverge on longer time scales? In this paper we introduce, discuss, and quantify metaconsistency in a Bayesian framework. We discuss how metaconsistency can be exploited to efficiently infer a model for a sub-system of a larger system, where inference on the global behavior may require much more data. We also discuss the relation between meta-consistency and the spectral properties of the model dynamical system in the case of uniformly ergodic diffusions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation of Structured Covariance Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes optimal convergence rates for estimation of structured covariance operators of Gaussian processes. We study banded operators with kernels that decay rapidly off-the-diagonal and $L^q$-sparse operators with an unordered sparsity pattern. For these classes of operators, we find the minimax optimal rate of estimation in operator norm, identifying the fundamental dimension-free quantities that determine the sample complexity. In addition, we prove that tapering and thresholding estimators attain the optimal rate. The proof of the upper bound for tapering estimators requires novel techniques to circumvent the issue that discretization of a banded operator does not result, in general, in a banded covariance matrix. To derive lower bounds for banded and $L^q$-sparse classes, we introduce a general framework to lift theory from high-dimensional matrix estimation to the operator setting. Our work contributes to the growing literature on operator estimation and learning, building on ideas from high-dimensional statistics while also addressing new challenges that emerge in infinite dimension.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error For Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating higher-order moments, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>On the consistent reasoning paradox of intelligence and optimal trust in AI: The power of 'I don't know'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Consistent Reasoning Paradox (CRP). Consistent reasoning, which lies at the core of human intelligence, is the ability to handle tasks that are equivalent, yet described by different sentences ('Tell me the time!' and 'What is the time?'). The CRP asserts that consistent reasoning implies fallibility -- in particular, human-like intelligence in AI necessarily comes with human-like fallibility. Specifically, it states that there are problems, e.g. in basic arithmetic, where any AI that always answers and strives to mimic human intelligence by reasoning consistently will hallucinate (produce wrong, yet plausible answers) infinitely often. The paradox is that there exists a non-consistently reasoning AI (which therefore cannot be on the level of human intelligence) that will be correct on the same set of problems. The CRP also shows that detecting these hallucinations, even in a probabilistic sense, is strictly harder than solving the original problems, and that there are problems that an AI may answer correctly, but it cannot provide a correct logical explanation for how it arrived at the answer. Therefore, the CRP implies that any trustworthy AI (i.e., an AI that never answers incorrectly) that also reasons consistently must be able to say 'I don't know'. Moreover, this can only be done by implicitly computing a new concept that we introduce, termed the 'I don't know' function -- something currently lacking in modern AI. In view of these insights, the CRP also provides a glimpse into the behaviour of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI cannot be 'almost sure', nor can it always explain itself, and therefore to be trustworthy it must be able to say 'I don't know'.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are currently considered for adoption in future 6G stantards. ETSI and 3GPP have started feasibility and performance investigations of such a technology. This work proposes an analytical model to analyze RIS performance. It relies on a simple street model where obstacles and mobile units are all aligned. RIS is positioned onto a building parallel to the road.

      <title>Graphon branching processes and fractional isomorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their study of the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs, Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan introduced a class of branching processes parametrized by a possibly unbounded graphon. We prove that two such branching processes have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic, a notion introduced by Greb\'ik and Rocha.
  A different class of branching processes was introduced by Hladk\'y, Nachmias, and Tran in relation to uniform spanning trees in finite graphs approximating a given connected graphon. We prove that two such branching processes have the same distribution if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic up to scalar multiple. Combined with a recent result of Archer and Shalev, this implies that if uniform spanning trees of two dense graphs have a similar local structure, they have a similar scaling limit.
  As a side result we give a characterization of fractional isomorphism for graphs as well as graphons in terms of their connected components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic heat equation on the 1-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}:=\left[-1,1\right]$ with periodic boundary conditions: $$ \partial_t u(t,x)=\partial^2_x u(t,x)+\sigma(t,x,u)\dot{F}(t,x),\quad x\in \mathbb{T},t\in\mathbb{R}_+, $$ where $\dot{F}(t,x)$ is a generalized Gaussian noise, which is white in time and colored in space. Assuming that $\sigma$ is Lipschitz in $u$ and uniformly bounded, we estimate small ball probabilities for the solution $u$ when $u(0,x)\equiv 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the distributions of lengths of runs in random sequences of elements from a totally ordered set (total order) or partially ordered set (partial order). In particular, we produce novel formulae for the expected value, variance, and probability generating function (PGF) of such lengths in the case of an arbitrary total order. Our focus is on the case of distributions with both atoms and diffuse (absolutely or singularly continuous) mass which has not been addressed in this generality before. We also provide a method of calculating the PGF of run lengths for countably series-parallel partial orders. Additionally, we prove a strong law of large numbers for the distribution of run lengths in a particular realization of an infinite sequence.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Regular Variation of Preferential Attachment Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of multivariate regular variation to analyse the extremal behaviour of preferential attachment models. To this end, we follow a directed linear preferential attachment model for a random, heavy-tailed number of steps in time and treat the incoming edge count of all existing nodes as a random vector of random length. By combining martingale properties, moment bounds and a Breiman type theorem we show that the resulting quantity is multivariate regularly varying, both as a vector of fixed length formed by the edge counts of a finite number of oldest nodes, and also as a vector of random length viewed in sequence space. A P\'{o}lya urn representation allows us to explicitly describe the extremal dependence between the degrees with the help of Dirichlet distributions. As a by-product of our analysis we establish new results for almost sure convergence of the edge counts in sequence space as the number of nodes goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study fractional stable random fields on the Sierpi\'nski gasket. Such fields are formally defined as $(-\Delta)^{-s} W_{K,\alpha}$, where $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator on the gasket and $W_{K,\alpha}$ is a stable random measure. Both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions for $\Delta$ are considered. Sample paths regularity and scaling properties are obtained. The techniques we develop are general and extend to the more general setting of the Barlow fractional spaces.</description>

      <title>On the resilience of the quadratic Littlewood-Offord problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistical resilience of the anti-concentration properties of Rademacher polynomials in face of adversarial deterministic noise taking the form of sign-flips. Given a multilinear polynomial $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ and a Rademacher vector $\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ (with independent entries), our results provide probabilistic lower bound estimations on the number of sign-flips that $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ can sustain without ``inflating" the atom probability $\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R} } \mathbb{P}\{f(\boldsymbol{\xi}) = x\}$ otherwise resulting in an adversarially biased distribution. Special emphasis is put on bilinear and quadratic forms, for which strengthened estimates are attained. From a computational perspective, our results in this venue are instance-bound in such a way that allows for an efficient computation of the statistical resilience guarantees from the quadratic polynomial itself directly. All of our probabilistic lower bound resilience guarantees are asymptotically tight.
  On route, we provide a short proof for a new small-ball probability estimate fitting Rademacher multilinear polynomials $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ removeing a polylog-factor from the classical Meka-Nguyen-Vu bound provided the coefficients are independent of $n$ (dimension-free, hereafter). This removal was conjectured to be possible by Meka-Nguyen-Vu regardless of our assumption. Bilinear Rademacher forms with dimension-free coefficients arise naturally in Combinatorics and specifically in the dense case of the edge-statistics conjecture posed by Alon, Hefetz, Krivelevich, and Tyomkyn. This case of the conjecture was resolved by Kwan and Sauermann. Replacing the appeal to the Meka-Nguyen-Vu classical bound in the work of Kwan, Sudakov, and Tran with our shortly proved result attains an additional proof of the dense case of the edge-statistics conjecture.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We will establish (paying particular attention to large, or small, ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansions terms as linear combinations, with rational polynomial coefficients, of higher order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$. With a proper parametrization, the expansions in the Gaussian cases can be understood, for given $n$, as the limit $p\to\infty$ of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focussing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with large sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Conditioning of Banach Space Valued Gaussian Random Variables: An Approximation Approach Based on Martingales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the conditional distributions of two Banach space valued, jointly Gaussian random variables. We show that these conditional distributions are again Gaussian and that their means and covariances are determined by a general finite dimensional approximation scheme based upon a martingale approach. In particular, it turns out that the covariance operators occurring in this scheme converge with respect to the nuclear norm and that the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Moreover, we discuss in detail, how our approximation scheme can be implemented in several classes of important Banach spaces such as (reproducing kernel) Hilbert spaces and spaces of continuous functions. As an example, we then apply our general results to the case of Gaussian processes with continuous paths conditioned to partial but infinite observations of their paths. Here we show that conditioning on sufficiently rich, increasing sets of finitely many observations leads to consistent approximations, that is, both the mean and covariance functions converge uniformly and the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Moreover, we discuss how these results improve our understanding of the popular Gaussian processes for machine learning.</description>

      <title>On the Multivariate Generalized Counting Process and its Time-Changed Variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a multivariate version of the generalized counting process (GCP) and discuss its various time-changed variants. The time is changed using random processes such as the stable subordinator, inverse stable subordinator, and their composition, tempered stable subordinator, gamma subordinator $etc.$ Several distributional properties that include the probability generating function, probability mass function and their governing differential equations are obtained for these variants. It is shown that some of these time-changed processes are L\'evy and for such processes we have derived the associated L\'evy measure. The explicit expressions for the covariance and codifference of the component processes for some of these time-changed variants are obtained. An application of the multivariate generalized space fractional counting process to shock models is discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a new interpretation of the Lions derivative as the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a vector measure, which provides a canonical extension of the Lions derivative for functions taking values in infinite dimensional Banach spaces. This is of particular relevance for the analysis of Hilbert space valued Mean-Field equations. As an illustration we derive a mild Ito-formula for Mean-Field stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), which provides the basis for a higher order Taylor expansion and higher order numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the maximum of a reducible two-type branching Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-type reducible branching Brownian motion, defined as a particle system on the real line in which particles of two types move according to independent Brownian motions and create offspring at a constant rate. Particles of type $1$ can give birth to particles of types $1$ and $2$, but particles of type $2$ only give birth to descendants of type $2$. Under some specific conditions, Belloum and Mallein in \cite{BeMa21} showed that the maximum position $M_t$ of all particles alive at time $t$, suitably centered by a deterministic function $m_t$, converge weakly. In this work, we are interested in the decay rate of the following upper large deviation probability, as $t\rightarrow\infty$, \[ {\mathbb P}(M_t\geq \theta m_t),\quad \theta&gt;1. \] We shall show that the decay rate function exhibits phase transitions depending on certain relations between $\theta$, the variance of the underling Brownian motion and the branching rate.</description>

En route, the spectral theory of noise-type Boolean algebras of Tsirelson is cast in the noncommutative language of "factorizations with unit" for which a muti-layered characterization of being "of Fock type" is provided.</description>

Abstract: In this note we consider the maximization of the expected terminal wealth for the setup of quadratic transaction costs. First, we provide a very simple probabilistic solution to the problem. Although the problem was largely studied, as far as we know up to date this simple and probabilistic form of the solution has not appeared in the literature.
  Next, we apply the general result for the numerical study of the case where the risky asset is given by a fractional Brownian Motion and the information flow of the investor can be diversified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article develops an analytical framework for studying information divergences and likelihood ratios associated with Poisson processes and point patterns on general measurable spaces. The main results include explicit analytical formulas for Kullback-Leibler divergences, R\'enyi divergences, Hellinger distances, and likelihood ratios of the laws of Poisson point patterns in terms of their intensity measures. The general results yield similar formulas for inhomogeneous Poisson processes, compound Poisson processes, as well as spatial and marked Poisson point patterns. Additional results include simple characterisations of absolute continuity, mutual singularity, and the existence of common dominating measures. The analytical toolbox is based on Tsallis divergences of sigma-finite measures on abstract measurable spaces. The treatment is purely information-theoretic and free of topological assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The faces of a convex set owe their relevance to an interplay between convexity and topology that is systematically studied in the work of Rockafellar. Infinite-dimensional convex sets are excluded from this theory as their relative interiors may be empty. Shirokov and the present author answered this issue by proving that every point in a convex set lies in the relative algebraic interior of the face it generates. This theorem is proved here in a simpler way, connecting ideas scattered throughout the literature. This article summarizes and develops methods for faces and their relative algebraic interiors and applies them to spaces of probability measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of $2^n$ candidates is presented to a commission. At every round, each member of this commission votes by pairwise comparison, and one-half of the candidates is deleted from the tournament, the remaining ones proceeding to the next round until the $n$-th round (the final one) in which the final winner is declared. The candidates are arranged on a board in a given order, which is maintained among the remaining candidates at all rounds. A study of the size of the commission is carried out in order to obtain the desired result of any candidate being a possible winner. For $2^n$ candidates with $n \geq 3$, we identify a voting profile with $4n -3$ voters such that any candidate could win just by choosing a proper initial order of the candidates. Moreover, in the setting of a random number of voters, we obtain the same results, with high probability, when the expected number of voters is large.</description>
