      <title>Rank type conditions on commutators in finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a subgroup $S$ of a group $G$, let $I_G(S)$ denote the set of commutators $[g,s]=g^{-1}g^s$, where $g\in G$ and $s\in S$, so that $[G,S]$ is the subgroup generated by $I_G(S)$. We prove that if $G$ is a $p$-soluble finite group with a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ such that any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(P)$ is $r$-generated, then $[G,P]$ has $r$-bounded rank. We produce examples showing that such a result does not hold without the assumption of $p$-solubility. Instead, we prove that if a finite group $G$ has a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ such that (a) any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(P)$ is $r$-generated, and (b) for any $x\in I_G(P)$, any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(x)$ is $r$-generated, then $[G,P]$ has $r$-bounded rank. We also prove that if $G$ is a finite group such that for every prime $p$ dividing $|G|$ for any Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$, any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(P)$ can be generated by $r$ elements, then the derived subgroup $G'$ has $r$-bounded rank. As an important tool in the proofs, we prove the following result, which is also of independent interest: if a finite group $G$ admits a group of coprime automorphisms $A$ such that any subgroup generated by a subset of $I_G(A)$ is $r$-generated, then the rank of $[G,A]$ is $r$-bounded.</description>

      <title>Quasimorphisms on free racks and free quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the second bounded cohomology of finitely generated free racks is infinite dimensional by constructing rack quasimorphisms using homogenous group quasimorphisms. Similar construction works in the case of free quandles. We show that Rolli's generalization to free products also works in the case of racks.</description>

      <title>On the homology of partial group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the partial group (co)homology of partial group actions using simplicial methods. We introduce the concept of universal globalization of a partial group action on a $K$-module and prove that, given a partial representation of $G$ on $M$, the partial group homology $H^{par}_{\bullet}(G, M)$ is naturally isomorphic to the usual group homology $H_{\bullet}(G, KG \otimes_{G_{par}} M)$, where $KG \otimes_{G_{par}} M$ is the universal globalization of the partial group action associated to $M$. We dualize this result into a cohomological spectral sequence converging to $H^{\bullet}_{par}(G,M)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$, a group $X$ is called a dihedral-skew product group of $G$ if $X=GD$ where $G\cap D=1$ and $D$ is a finite dihedral group with trivial core in $X$. In this paper, dihedral-skew product groups of all nonabelian simple groups are classified.</description>

      <title>Streaming word problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study deterministic and randomized streaming algorithms for word problems of finitely generated groups. For finitely generated linear groups, metabelian groups and free solvable groups we show the existence of randomized streaming algorithms with logarithmic space complexity for their word problems. We also show that the class of finitely generated groups with a logspace randomized streaming algorithm for the word problem is closed under several group theoretical constructions: finite extensions, graph products and wreath products by free abelian groups. We contrast these results with several lower bound. An example of a finitely presented group, where the word problem has only a linear space randomized streaming algorithm, is Thompson's group $F$. Finally, randomized streaming algorithms for subgroup membership problems in free groups and direct products of free groups are studied.</description>

      <title>Powers of commutators in linear algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\mathscr G}$ be a linear algebraic group over $k$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field, a pseudo-finite field or the valuation ring of a nonarchimedean local field. Let $G= {\mathscr G}(k)$. We prove that if $\gamma, \delta\in G$ such that $\gamma$ is a commutator and $\langle \delta\rangle= \langle \gamma\rangle$ then $\delta$ is a commutator. This generalises a result of Honda for finite groups. Our proof uses the Lefschetz Principle from first-order model theory.</description>

      <title>Cliques in derangement graphs for innately transitive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a permutation group $G$, the derangement graph of $G$ is the Cayley graph with connection set the derangements of $G$. The group $G$ is said to be innately transitive if $G$ has a transitive minimal normal subgroup. Clearly, every primitive group is innately transitive. We show that, besides an infinite family of explicit exceptions, there exists a function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that, if $G$ is innately transitive of degree $n$ and the derangement graph of $G$ has no clique of size $k$, then $n\le f(k)$.
  Motivation for this work arises from investigations on Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type theorems for permutation groups.</description>

      <title>The category of partial group actions: quotients, (co)limits and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06223v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the category of partial actions, where the group and the set upon which the group acts can vary. Within this framework, we develop a theory of quotient partial actions and prove that this category is both (co)complete and encompasses the category of groupoids as a full subcategory.
  In particular, we establish the existence of a pair of adjoint functors, denoted as $\Phi : \textbf{Grpd} \to \textbf{PA}$ and $\Psi : \textbf{PA} \to \textbf{Grpd}$, with the property that $\Psi \Phi \cong 1_{\textbf{Grpd} }$.
  Next, for a given groupoid $\Gamma$, we provide a characterization of all partial actions that allow the recovery of the groupoid $\Gamma$ through $\Psi$. This characterization is expressed in terms of certain normal subgroups of a universal group constructed from $\Gamma.$</description>

      <title>Showcasing straight-line programs with memory via matrix Bruhat decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5617</link>
      <description>arXiv:1305.5617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest that straight-line programs designed for algebraic computations should be accompanied by a comprehensive complexity analysis that takes into account both the number of fundamental algebraic operations needed, as well as memory requirements arising during evaluation. We introduce an approach for formalising this idea and, as illustration, construct and analyse straight-line programs for the Bruhat decomposition of $d\times d$ matrices with determinant $1$ over a finite field of order $q$ that have length $O(d^2\log(q))$ and require storing only $O(\log(q))$ matrices during evaluation.</description>

      <title>The structure of quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor with applications to the domino problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. In this paper we obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph $G$ avoiding a minor has a tree-decomposition whose torsos are finite or planar; moreover the tree-decomposition is canonical, i.e. invariant under the action of the automorphism group of $G$. As applications of this result, we prove the following.
  * Every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This extends a result of Thomassen (1992) who proved it in the 4-connected case and suggested that this assumption could be omitted.
  * Locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor are accessible (in the sense of Thomassen and Woess), which extends known results on planar graphs to any proper minor-closed family.
  * Minor-excluded finitely generated groups are accessible (in the group-theoretic sense) and finitely presented, which extends classical results on planar groups.
  * The domino problem is decidable in a minor-excluded finitely generated group if and only if the group is virtually free, which proves the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018).</description>

      <title>Solid lines in axial algebras of Jordan type $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a primitive axial algebra of Jordan type $\eta = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a Jordan algebra if and only if every $2$-generated subalgebra is \emph{solid}, a notion introduced recently by Ilya Gorshkov, Sergey Shpectorov and Alexei Staroletov.
  As a byproduct, we show that a subalgebra generated by axes $a,b$ is solid if and only if the associator $[L_a,L_b]$ is a derivation. Moreover, we show that $2$-generated subalgebras that are not solid contain precisely $3$ axes.</description>
