      <title>Photonic quasicrystal of spin angular momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals,characterized by long-range order without translational symmetry,have catalyzed transformative advances in various fields,including optics in terms of field quasicrystals.Here,we present the first demonstration of photonic quasicrystals formed by spin angular momentum, unveiling novel spin-orbit coupling effects absent in traditional field quasicrystals.A de Bruijn tiling like theoretical framework was built elucidating the formation mechanism of spin quasicrystals for diverse symmetries.Moreover,the configurations of these spin textures can be manipulated through the adjustments of the wavefronts,among which phason-like discontinuous dynamics is observed and quantitatively measured. Unlike optical quasicrystals shaped by electromagnetic fields,these spin-governed quasicrystals exhibit quasi-periodic properties of kinematic parameters,extending their potential applications to other physical systems. These findings hold promise for novel advancements in optical trapping,quasicrystal fabrication,and optical encryption systems.</description>

      <title>Physical encryption and decryption for secure data transmission in optical networks leveraging the temporal Talbot effect and microwave photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel microwave photonic scheme for secure data transmission in optical networks is proposed. The security of the scheme is guaranteed by physical encryption and decryption via the temporal Talbot effect in dispersive mediums. First, the original data is randomized in the digital domain by performing an exclusive OR operation using a random matrix. Subsequently, a time-varying multi-tone electrical signal, which represents the randomized data matrix, is modulated onto an optical carrier. The optical signal after modulation is then phase-modulated by a temporal Talbot array illuminator (TAI) signal, and the optical signal after discrete quadratic phase modulation will lose its original appearance in the frequency domain and be further dispersed in the first dispersive medium. Due to the dispersion that does not match the TAI signal exactly, the waveform after the first dispersive medium is a noise-like signal. Hence, the physical encryption of the original data is successfully achieved. As the optical signal passes a second dispersive medium that makes the total dispersion match the TAI signal, the temporal waveform of the noise-like signal after photodetection is transformed into pulses. "1" and "0" in the randomized data matrix are represented through the presence and absence of pulses, and the physical decryption is achieved. By further processing the recovered data matrix using the random matrix, the original data can be recovered. The physical layer security of the proposed scheme and its fiber transmission capability are demonstrated. 8-Gbit/s data is transmitted, encrypted, and decrypted using two dispersive mediums and an optical fiber of 10 to 200 km, and error-free transmission is achieved. Many factors that affect the encryption, decryption, and transmission performance of the system have been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of a single molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful method that avoids ensemble averaging, but its temporal resolution is limited by the fluorescence lifetime to nanoseconds at most. At the ensemble level, two-dimensional spectroscopy provides insight into ultrafast femtosecond processes such as energy transfer and line broadening, even beyond the Fourier limit, by correlating pump and probe spectra. Here, we combine these two techniques and demonstrate 2D spectroscopy of individual molecules at room temperature using the example of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) in a polymer matrix. We excite the molecule in a confocal microscope with a phase-modulated train of femtosecond pulses and detect the emitted fluorescence with single-photon counting detectors. Using a phase sensitive detection scheme, we were able to measure the nonlinear 2D spectra of most of the DBT molecules we studied. Our method is applicable to a wide range of single emitters and opens new avenues for understanding energy transfer in single quantum objects on ultrafast time scales.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the wafer scale fabrication of single mode low-loss lithium niobate on insulator waveguides utilizing a chemically amplified resist and an optimized dry etching method. The fabricated single mode waveguides are free of residuals and re-deposition, with measured losses for straight waveguides around 2 dB/m (0.02 dB/cm). We present on a method offering advantages for large-scale production due to its cost-effectiveness, faster writing time, and simplified processes. This work holds promise for advancing integrated photonics and optical communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Second-order artifact overwhelming the third-order signal in 2D Raman-THz spectroscopy of non-centrosymmetric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through comprehensive data analysis, we demonstrate that a second-order artifact contributes significantly to the measured signal in 2D Raman-THz spectroscopy of non-centrosymmetric materials. We confirm that by measuring the 2D Raman-THz response of a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal, a well-known ${\chi}^{(2)}$ active sample. More importantly, we show that this strong second-order artifact can be effectively suppressed by implementing a special detection scheme. By doing so, we successfully isolate the desired third-order nonlinear response. Our experimentally recovered 2D Raman-THz signal for an x-cut BBO crystal reveals a distinct cross-peak feature, whose frequency position suggests the presence of phonon-phonon coupling within this crystal. Our study emphasizes the critical significance of considering second-order nonlinear responses when conducting 2D THz experiments involving non-centrosymmetric samples.</description>

      <title>Tunable frequency conversion in doped photonic crystal fiber pumped near degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future quantum networks will rely on the ability to coherently transfer optically encoded quantum information between different wavelength bands. Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing in optical fiber is a promising route to achieving this, but requires fibers with precise dispersion control and broadband transmission at signal, target and pump wavelengths. Here we introduce a photonic crystal fiber with a germanium-doped core featuring group velocity matching at 1550 nm, the telecoms C-band, and 920 nm, within the emission range of efficient single photon sources based on InAs quantum dots. With low chromatic walk-off and good optical guidance even at long wavelengths, large lengths of this fiber are used to achieve nanometer-scale frequency shifts between wavelengths around 920 nm with up to 79.4\% internal conversion efficiency, allowing dissimilar InAs dots to be interfaced. We also show how cascading this frequency conversion can be used to generate a frequency comb away from telecoms wavelengths. Finally, we use the fiber to demonstrate tunable frequency conversion of weak classical signals around 918 nm to the telecoms C-band.</description>

      <title>Quantum backreaction effect in optical soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical solitons classically are stationary solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We perform a quantum field theoretic treatment by quantising a linearised fluctuation field around the classical soliton solution which can be seen as providing a background spacetime for the field. The linearised fluctuation modifies the soliton background, which is often neglected, reminiscent of the nondepleted-pump approximation. Going beyond this approximation and by using a number-conserving Bogoljubov approach, we find unstable modes that grow as the soliton propagates. Eventually, these unstable modes induce a considerable (backreaction) effect in the soliton. We calculate the backreaction in the classical field fully analytically in the leading second order. The result is a quadratic local decrease of the soliton photon number in propagation due to the backreaction effect of the unstable mode. Provided the initial pulse is close to the classical soliton solution, the unstable mode contributions always become dominant. We also consider practical scenarios for observing this quantum-induced soliton distortion, in the spectral domain. The backreaction, which we expect to be present in bright and dark, discrete and continuous solitons and other nonlinear pulses plays an important role for future optical analogue gravity experiments, for soliton lasers, and optical communications.</description>

      <title>&gt; 2{\pi} Phase Modulation using Exciton-Polaritons in a Two-Dimensional Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metamaterials promise to enable arbitrary, temporal control over the propagation of wavefronts of light for applications such as beam steering, optical communication modulators, and holograms. This has been done in the past using patterned silicon photonics to locally control the phase of light such that the metasurface acts as a large number of wavelets. Although phase modulation only requires refractive index modulation when the interaction length is on the order of the wavelength, this is not enough to significantly modulate the phase of light in flatland. Instead, phase modulation is achieved using a resonant mode such as a plasmon or high-Q cavity mode that enable light to accumulate a large amount of phase over a short distance and coupling it to an active material that modulates the light-matter interactions. Here, we report that electrostatic doping can modulate the light-matter interaction strength of a two-dimensional WS2 based multi quantum well (MQW) structure going from strongly-coupled, phase-accumulating exciton-polaritons to weakly-coupled exciton-trion-polaritons. As a result of this transition, 2.02{\pi} radians of phase modulation is observed using spectroscopic ellipsometry. This result demonstrates the potential of the MQW structure as a compact, lightweight electro-optical modulators for LiDAR and optical communications in the red region of visible spectrum.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous integration of amorphous silicon carbide on thin film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, lithium niobate (LiNbO3 or LN) photonics, thanks to its heat-free and fast electro-optical modulation, second-order non-linearities and low loss, has been extensively investigated. Despite numerous demonstrations of high-performance LN photonics, processing lithium niobate remains challenging and suffers from incompatibilities with standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication lines, limiting its scalability. Silicon carbide (SiC) is an emerging material platform with a high refractive index, a large non-linear Kerr coefficient, and a promising candidate for heterogeneous integration with LN photonics. Current approaches of SiC/LN integration require transfer-bonding techniques, which are time-consuming, expensive, and lack precision in layer thickness. Here we show that amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), deposited using inductively coupled plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ICPCVD) at low temperatures (&lt; 165 C), can be conveniently integrated with LiNbO3 and processed to form high-performance photonics. Most importantly, the fabrication only involves a standard, silicon-compatible, reactive ion etching step and leaves the LiNbO3 intact, hence its compatibility with standard foundry processes. As a proof-of-principle, we fabricated waveguides and ring resonators on the developed a-SiC/LN platform and achieved intrinsic quality factors higher than 106,000 and resonance electro-optic tunability of 3.4 pm/V with 3 mm tuning length. We showcase the possibility of dense integration by fabricating and testing ring resonators with 40um radius without a noticeable loss penalty. Our platform offers a CMOS-compatible and scalable approach for implementation of future fast electro-optic modulators and reconfigurable photonic circuits as well as nonlinear processes which can benefit from involving both second and third-order nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic lightning-rod effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasmonic lightning-rod effect refers to the formation of a strong electric near field of localized surface plasmons at the sharp features of plasmonic antennas. While this effect is intuitively utilized in the design and optimization of plasmonic antennas, the relation between the magnitude of the electric field and the local curvature of the plasmonic antenna has not been yet rigorously established. Here, we provide such a study. We design sets of plasmonic antennas that allow to isolate the role of the local curvature from other effects influencing the field. The near electric field is inspected by electron energy loss spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. We demonstrate the existence of the plasmonic lightning-rod effect and establish its quantitative description, showing that its strength is comparable to the electrostatic lightning-rod effect. We also provide a simple phenomenological formula for the spatial dependence of the field. Finally, we introduce the effective radius of curvature related to the spatial distribution of induced charge in plasmonic antennas, significantly smaller than their geometrical radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate coupling of a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) to an optomechanical cavity, mediated by the strain of a nano-mechanical mode. The device comprises an optomechanical photonic crystal nanobeam in GaAs with embedded In(Ga)As QDs. The flexural mechanical mode of the device can be optically driven exploiting the large optomechanical coupling rate of the cavity. The vibrations generate a time-modulated strain field that shifts the quantum dot transition energy. We observe that optical driving of the mechanical mode induces a shift in an excitonic line corresponding to an estimated vacuum strain coupling rate of 214 kHz. Our approach represents an important step towards the use of phonons to couple different on-chip quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Second-Harmonic Generation in Sub-wavelength Periodically Poled Thin Film Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second harmonic generation (SHG) extensively employs periodically poled nonlinear crystals through forward quasi-phase-matching to achieve efficient frequency conversion. As poling periods approach sub-micrometers, backward quasi-phase-matching has also been demonstrated, albeit by utilizing pulsed laser drives. The realization of symmetric second harmonic generation, characterized by counterpropagating pumps, however, has remained elusive despite theoretical predictions. The main challenge lies in achieving strong nonlinear coupling with poling period below half the wavelength of the second-harmonic light. The recent emergence of high-quality ferroelectric lithium niobate thin films provides an opportunity for achieving precise domain control at submicron dimensions. In this article, we demonstrate reliable control of ferroelectric domains in thin film lithium niobate waveguide with a poling period down to 370nm, thereby realizing highly efficient continuous-wave pumped symmetric SHG. This demonstration not only validates the feasibility of achieving subwavelength periodic poling on waveguides but also opens new avenues for leveraging submicron ferroelectric domain structures in integrated photonics and nonlinear optics research.</description>

      <title>A class of stable nonlinear non-Hermitian skin modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a well-known phenomenon in open topological systems that causes a large number of eigenstates to become localized at the boundary. Although many aspects of its theory have been investigated in linear systems, this phenomenon remains novel in nonlinear models. In the first step of this paper, we look at the conditions for the presence of quasi-skin modes in a semi-infinite, one-dimensional, nonlinear, nonreciprocal lattice. In the following phase, we explore the survival time of the quasi-skin mode in a finite nonlinear lattice with open edges. We study the dependency of the survival time on the system's parameters and demonstrate how the nonreciprocity of the system affects the survival time. This study introduces a method for achieving a stable localized state in a nonlinear finite lattice.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Single CdSe Magic-Sized Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical syntheses that provide nanocrystals (NCs) with narrow distributions in size and shape are critical for NC research. This has led to the investigation of magic-sized NCs (MSNCs), a class of semiconductor crystallites that grow in discrete steps, potentially offering a single size and shape (i.e., monodispersity). However, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdSe MSNCs measured at room temperature have been reported to be broader than those of state-of-the-art quantum dots. This difference could be due to the smaller size of MSNCs, which broadens their line widths, or due to their residual size dispersity. To better understand the optical performance of MSNCs, here we perform single-particle spectroscopy. Our results show that, while CdSe MSNCs do exhibit particle-to-particle variations that lead to modest broadening of their ensemble emission spectra, the largest contribution comes from the single-particle line width. By examining MSNCs with different sizes and shells, we conclude that this single-particle broadening is consistent with exciton coupling to acoustic phonons from the NC surface. Because of their small size, this coupling and the role of residual size dispersity have a larger impact on the ensemble emission line widths. Notably, when small (&lt;2.7 nm diameter) MSNCs and quantum dots are compared, the ensemble PL line widths of MSNCs are actually sharper. Due to their small size, MSNCs also exhibit strong anti-bunching $[g^{(2)}(0) \sim 0.05]$ at room temperature. Thus, MSNCs represent a bright, spectrally pure class of quantum emitter, useful for applications in optoelectronic and quantum-information technologies where strong three-dimensional confinement is required.</description>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) studies crucial principles that are applicable to a variety of fields, including wireless networking and autonomous driving. We propose a photonic-based decision-making algorithm to address one of the most fundamental problems in MARL, called the competitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that chaotic oscillations and cluster synchronization of optically coupled lasers, along with our proposed decentralized coupling adjustment, efficiently balance exploration and exploitation while facilitating cooperative decision-making without explicitly sharing information among agents. Our study demonstrates how decentralized reinforcement learning can be achieved by exploiting complex physical processes controlled by simple algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In recent decades, the demand for computational power has surged, particularly with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). As we navigate the post-Moore's law era, the limitations of traditional electrical digital computing, including process bottlenecks and power consumption issues, are propelling the search for alternative computing paradigms. Among various emerging technologies, integrated photonics stands out as a promising solution for next-generation high-performance computing, thanks to the inherent advantages of light, such as low latency, high bandwidth, and unique multiplexing techniques. Furthermore, the progress in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which are equipped with abundant photoelectronic components, positions photonic-electronic integrated circuits as a viable solution for high-performance computing and hardware AI accelerators. In this review, we survey recent advancements in both PIC-based digital and analog computing for AI, exploring the principal benefits and obstacles of implementation. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive analysis of photonic AI from the perspectives of hardware implementation, accelerator architecture, and software-hardware co-design. In the end, acknowledging the existing challenges, we underscore potential strategies for overcoming these issues and offer insights into the future drivers for optical computing.</description>
