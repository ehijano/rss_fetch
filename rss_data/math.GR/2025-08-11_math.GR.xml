      <title>Finite 2-groups having a cyclic or dihedral maximal subgroup and arc-transitive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all finite 2-groups that have a cyclic or dihedral maximal subgroup and determine their automorphism groups. Based on this result, we classify all pairs $ (G,\mathcal{M}) $, such that $ G $ is a finite 2-group and $ \mathcal{M} $ is a $ G $-arc-transitive map with Euler characteristic not being divisible by 4.</description>

      <title>Trace Minimization and Roots in ${\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $A,B \in {\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ generate a discrete and free group of rank 2, and let $m,n\ge 1$. We consider subgroups $\langle R,S\rangle$ of ${\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ generated by roots of $A$ and $B$, i.e., by elements such that $R^m=A$ and $S^n=B$. Depending on whether the commutator trace $\tau={\rm tr}([A,B])$ is larger or smaller than 2, we describe necessary and sufficient conditions for $\langle R,S\rangle$ to be discrete and free of rank 2. For $\tau\le -2$, this can be checked with an explicit formula. For $\tau &gt; 2$, one has to use the Trace Minimization Algorithm. Besides an explicit formulation of this algorithm, we prove new formulas for the powers and roots of elements of ${\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, their traces and their commutator traces. The case of positive rational exponents $m,n$ is treated, as well.</description>

      <title>Prime Order Element Graph of a Group -- II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this sequel paper, we continue the analysis of the prime order element graph $\Gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$, where vertices are elements of $G$ and edges connect distinct elements $x, y$ satisfying $\circ(xy) = p$ for some prime $p$. Our investigation focuses on the adjacency and Laplacian spectra, planarity, and clique number of this graph. We conclude by outlining open issues and potential directions for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Cosets of normal subgroups and union of two conjugacy classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$ and $x\in G-N$. We discuss when the coset $Nx$ is contained in the union of two conjugacy classes, $K$ and $D$, of $G$. We show that $N$ need not be solvable, and can even be non-abelian simple, but in these cases, $K$ and $D$ must have the same cardinality, and the non-solvable structure of $N$ is restricted. The non-abelian principal factors of $G$ contained in $N$ are then isomorphic to $S\times \cdots\times S$, where $S$ is a simple group of Lie type of odd characteristic.</description>

      <title>A note on the singularity conjecture for infinite covolume discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks on semisimple Lie groups where the support of the step distribution generates (as a group) a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of infinite covolume. When the semisimple Lie group has property (T), we show that the stationary measure on the Furstenberg boundary is singular to the Lebesgue measure class. This result does not require any condition on the moment or symmetry of the step distribution. When the semisimple Lie group has rank one and the step distribution has a finite first moment, we again show that the stationary measure on the Furstenberg boundary is singular to the Lebesgue measure class. For general semisimple Lie groups, we also obtain a sufficient condition for the singularity of the stationary measure and a general Patterson-Sullivan measure.</description>

      <title>Induced Minors, Asymptotic Dimension, and Baker's Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic dimension is a large-scale invariant of metric spaces that was introduced by Gromov (1993). We prove that every hereditary class of bounded-degree graphs that excludes some graph as a fat minor has asymptotic dimension at most $2$, which is optimal. This makes substantial progress on a question of Bonamy, Bousquet, Esperet, Groenland, Liu, Pirot, and Scott (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 2023).
  The key to our proof is a notion inspired by Baker's technique (J. ACM 1994). We say that a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded Baker-treewidth if there exists a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that, for every graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$, there is a layering of $G$ such that the subgraph induced by the union of any $\ell$ consecutive layers has treewidth at most $f(\ell)$. We show that every class of bounded-degree graphs that excludes some graph as an induced minor has bounded Baker-treewidth. We discuss further applications of this result to clustered colouring and the design of linear-time approximate schemes.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Furstenberg measure for infinite covolume discrete subroups in higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetric random walks on discrete, Zariski-dense subgroups $\Gamma$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$ with Property (T). We prove that if $\Gamma$ has infinite covolume, then the associated hitting measure on the Furstenberg boundary of $G$ is singular. This is in contrast to Furstenberg's discretization of Brownian motion to lattices, and it is the first result of this type when $G$ has higher rank.</description>

      <title>On the Parallel Complexity of Identifying Groups and Quasigroups via Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity of isomorphism testing for finite groups and quasigroups, given by their multiplication tables. We crucially take advantage of their various decompositions to show the following:
  - We first consider the class $\mathcal{C}$ of groups that admit direct product decompositions, where each indecompsable factor is $O(1)$-generated, and either perfect or centerless. We show any group in $\mathcal{C}$ is identified by the $O(1)$-dimensional count-free Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) algorithm with $O(\log \log n)$ rounds, and the $O(1)$-dimensional counting WL algorithm with $O(1)$ rounds. Consequently, the isomorphism problem for $\mathcal{C}$ is in $\textsf{L}$. The previous upper bound for this class was $\textsf{TC}^{1}$, using $O(\log n)$ rounds of the $O(1)$-dimensional counting WL (Grochow and Levet, FCT 2023).
  - We next consider more generally, the class of groups where each indecomposable factor is $O(1)$-generated. We exhibit an $\textsf{AC}^{3}$ canonical labeling procedure for this class. Here, we accomplish this by showing that in the multiplication table model, the direct product decomposition can be computed in $\textsf{AC}^{3}$, parallelizing the work of Kayal and Nezhmetdinov (ICALP 2009).
  - Isomorphism testing between a central quasigroup $G$ and an arbitrary quasigroup $H$ is in $\textsf{NC}$. Here, we take advantage of the fact that central quasigroups admit an affine decomposition in terms of an underlying Abelian group. Only the trivial bound of $n^{\log(n)+O(1)}$-time was previously known for isomorphism testing of central quasigroups.</description>

      <title>Orbit-blocking words in free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By strengthening known results about primitivity-blocking words in free groups, we prove that for any nontrivial element w of a free group of finite rank, there are words that cannot be subwords of any cyclically reduced automorphic image of w. This has implications for the average-case complexity of a variant of Whitehead's problem.</description>

      <title>Orders of commutators and Products of conjugacy classes in finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, let $x\in G$ and let $p$ be a prime. We prove that the commutator $[x,g]$ is a $p$-element for every $g\in G$ if and only if $x$ is central modulo $O_p(G),$ where $O_p(G)$ denotes the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$. This result simultaneously generalizes some variants of both the Baer-Suzuki theorem and Glauberman's $Z_p^*$-theorem. Furthermore, we show that if $x\in G$ is a $p$-element and there exists an integer $m\ge 1$ such that for all $g\in G$, either $[x,g]=1$ or the order of $[x,g] $ is $m$ for every $g\in G$, then the subgroup generated by the conjugacy class of $G$ containing $x$ is solvable. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Beltr\'an, Felipe and Melchor, which states that if $K$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ such that the product $K^{-1}K=1\cup D\cup D^{-1}$ for some conjugacy class $D$ of $G$, then the subgroup generated by $K$ is solvable.</description>
