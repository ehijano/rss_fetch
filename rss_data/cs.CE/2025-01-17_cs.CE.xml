      <title>Physics-Aware POD-Based Learning for Ab initio QEM-Galerkin Simulations of Periodic Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum nanostructures offer crucial applications in electronics, photonics, materials, drugs, etc. For accurate design and analysis of nanostructures and materials, simulations of the Schrodinger or Schrodinger-like equation are always needed. For large nanostructures, these eigenvalue problems can be computationally intensive. One effective solution is a learning method via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), together with ab initio Galerkin projection of the Schrodinger equation. POD-Galerkin projects the problem onto a reduced-order space with the POD basis representing electron wave functions (WFs) guided by the first principles in simulations. To minimize training effort and enhance robustness of POD-Galerkin in larger structures, the quantum element method (QEM) was proposed previously, which partitions nanostructures into generic quantum elements. Larger nanostructures can then be constructed by the trained generic quantum elements, each of which is represented by its POD-Galerkin model. This work investigates QEM-Galerkin thoroughly in multi-element quantum-dot (QD) structures on approaches to further improve training effectiveness and simulation accuracy and efficiency for QEM-Galerkin. To further improve computing speed, POD and Fourier bases for periodic potentials are also examined in QEM-Galerkin simulations. Results indicate that, considering efficiency and accuracy, the POD potential basis is superior to the Fourier potential basis even for periodic potentials. Overall, QEM-Galerkin offers more than a 2-order speedup in computation over direct numerical simulation for multi-element QD structures, and more improvement is observed in a structure comprising more elements.</description>

      <title>Mining Intraday Risk Factor Collections via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning based on Transferred Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional risk factors like beta, size/value, and momentum often lag behind market dynamics in measuring and predicting stock return volatility. Statistical models like PCA and factor analysis fail to capture hidden nonlinear relationships. Genetic programming (GP) can identify nonlinear factors but often lacks mechanisms for evaluating factor quality, and the resulting formulas are complex. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework for automated factor generation and evaluation. HPPO uses two PPO models: a high-level policy assigns weights to stock features, and a low-level policy identifies latent nonlinear relationships. The Pearson correlation between generated factors and return volatility serves as the reward signal. Transfer learning pre-trains the high-level policy on large-scale historical data, fine-tuning it with the latest data to adapt to new features and shifts. Experiments show the HPPO-TO algorithm achieves a 25\% excess return in HFT markets across China (CSI 300/800), India (Nifty 100), and the US (S\&amp;P 500). Code and data are available at https://github.com/wencyxu/HRL-HF_risk_factor_set.</description>

      <title>WindsorML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset For Automotive Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source high-fidelity dataset for Machine Learning (ML) containing 355 geometric variants of the Windsor body, to help the development and testing of ML surrogate models for external automotive aerodynamics. Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a GPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a Cartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that exhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those observed on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume &amp; boundary data as well as the geometry and force &amp; moment coefficients. This paper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as contents and structure of the dataset. To the authors knowledge, this represents the first, large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset for the Windsor body with a permissive open-source license (CC-BY-SA).</description>

      <title>CryoBench: Diverse and challenging datasets for the heterogeneity problem in cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining high-resolution 3D biomolecular structures from imaging data. Its unique ability to capture structural variability has spurred the development of heterogeneous reconstruction algorithms that can infer distributions of 3D structures from noisy, unlabeled imaging data. Despite the growing number of advanced methods, progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks with ground truth information and reliable validation metrics. Here, we introduce CryoBench, a suite of datasets, metrics, and benchmarks for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM. CryoBench includes five datasets representing different sources of heterogeneity and degrees of difficulty. These include conformational heterogeneity generated from designed motions of antibody complexes or sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation, as well as compositional heterogeneity from mixtures of ribosome assembly states or 100 common complexes present in cells. We then analyze state-of-the-art heterogeneous reconstruction tools, including neural and non-neural methods, assess their sensitivity to noise, and propose new metrics for quantitative evaluation. We hope that CryoBench will be a foundational resource for accelerating algorithmic development and evaluation in the cryo-EM and machine learning communities.

      <title>An Adaptive Collocation Point Strategy For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive collocation point selection strategy utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs, including the wave, Allen-Cahn, and Burgers' equations, demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approach improves PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</description>
