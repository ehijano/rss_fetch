      <title>Hunting for Neutrino Texture Zeros with Muon and Tau Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the minimal type II seesaw mechanism generating the Majorana neutrino mass matrix $M^{\nu}$, under the assumption that two entries of $M^{\nu}$ vanish. Such flavor structures are known as two-zero textures. Processes with charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), absent in the Standard Model (SM), can have sizable rates in this framework and are directly linked to the flavor structure of $M^{\nu}$. For each allowed two-zero texture, we quantify the predicted correlations among various CLFV observables using current neutrino oscillation data and show that they lead to distinctive patterns of CLFV processes that could be discriminated between at running and upcoming experiments. In addition, together with information from colliders, the sensitivity of these correlations to renormalization group (RG) effects could shed light on the potentially ultra-high scale where new dynamics (e.g. some underlying flavor symmetry) give rise to the two-zero texture. Furthermore, we find that certain zero textures, although not third-generation specific, can suppress $\mu\to e$ transitions while allowing the rate of the process $\tau\to \bar\mu ee$ to be within the future experimental sensitivity, even when the RG evolution is taken into account. The lowest possible cut-off scale of the effective theory, constructed by treating the two-zero flavor structure of $M^{\nu}$ as a CLFV spurion, can therefore reach $5-6$ TeV. Our results provide further motivation for searches for $\tau$ CLFV at Belle II, as probes of new physics complementary to MEG II and the upcoming Mu3e, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, as well as for collider searches for doubly charged scalar bosons.</description>

      <title>Isospin-breaking in the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude I: Effects due to the pion mass difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers devoted to a detailed analysis of isospin-breaking effects in the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude and the vector form factor of the pion. Isospin breaking originates from the mass difference between up and down quarks and from electromagnetic effects. The latter can be further split into effects due to the pion-mass difference and the remaining virtual and real photonic effects. In this paper, we derive the modifications to the Roy equations for $\pi\pi$ scattering due to the mass difference between the charged and the neutral pion. We solve the equations numerically after matching them to the chiral representation of the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude evaluated in the same approximation, which is also provided. Numerical results are presented and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Hadronic CP Violation in the 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete two-loop calculation of the electric and chromo-electric dipole moments of the light quarks and the gluon, as well as contributions to CP-violating lepton-quark interactions, in the unconstrained two-Higgs doublet model. We include the most general Yukawa interactions of the Higgs doublets with the Standard Model fermions up to quadratic order, and allow for generic phases in the Higgs potential. We pay particular attention to a consistent treatment of all fermionic contributions in the low-energy effective theory, including a consistent renormalization-group summation of all leading-logarithmic effects. This latter part of the work is independent of the specific UV model and can generally be applied to a large class of models that do not introduce new light degrees of freedom. A python implementation of our results is provided via a public git repository.</description>

      <title>Global Determination of $|V_{us}|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of ongoing issues with the first-row unitarity test of the CKM matrix, we showcase a global fit to measurements of $K\to \ell \nu$, $K\to \pi\ell \nu$, $\tau \to K\nu$, and $\tau\to K\pi \nu$ decays for the first time. Fitting the semileptonic and 3-body $\tau$ decay data simultaneously becomes computationally feasible because we employ a simple form factor parametrisation for the $K\pi$ form factor that manifestly connects the semileptonic and pair-production regions. We find good agreement with the data and use our analyses to infer $|V_{us}|$ and the parameters for the $K\pi$ form factors. Our result for $|V_{us}|$ sits between the results extracted from exclusive $K_{\ell 2}$ and $K_{\ell 3}$ decays and somewhat above the inclusive $\tau$ decay result. Moreover, our results for the $K\to \pi$ vector form factor at zero momentum transfer are compatible with lattice QCD determinations, despite not using lattice QCD inputs for this quantity. We are further able to determine some of the pole parameters of the individual scalar and vector $K\pi$ resonances with masses below the $\tau$ mass. We caution that our results account only for short-distance electromagnetic corrections but not long-distance contributions; this is due to the lack of a consistent description of long-distance corrections to the $K\pi$ matrix elements both above and below threshold for an arbitrary model of the form factors.</description>

      <title>Ward-Takahashi identity in light-front formalism for a bound state of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Ward-Takahashi identity at one-loop in the light-front (LF) formalism for a bound state of fermions. We consider a spinless bound state made up of two fermions in which the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied in the covariant formulation. Considering the same system in the light-front formalism, we investigate the proof of Ward-Takahashi identity by integrating the light-front energy component through the identification of the relevant ranges of the longitudinal LF momentum. We elucidate that the pair production diagram plays a crucial role in establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity. We also point out the necessity of taking into account the corresponding zero modes for truly establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity in the LF formalism.</description>

      <title>Correlations between heavy mesons and the creation of the charmonia, bottomonia, and $B_c$ mesons in high energy $pp$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The different QCD processes, which can produce a heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\bar Q$) pair, induce different correlations between the heavy quarks. Employing the EPOS4HQ event generator we study the consequences of these correlations and compare the calculation with experimental results on open and hidden heavy flavour mesons, measured in proton-proton (pp) collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We find that the measured correlations between heavy mesons are a direct image of the different production mechanisms, which contribute also in a different way to the transverse momentum distribution of open and hidden heavy flavour mesons. The latter are calculated in a Wigner density approach which also enables to reproduce quantitatively the measured $B_c$ spectra. This agreement allows conclusions on the spatial distribution of the heavy quark creation processes.</description>

      <title>Did our Universe Tunnel out of the Wrong Higgs Vacuum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores various aspects and implications of the initial configuration of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field at the beginning of our Universe. It is well known that the SM Higgs field features a deeper, more stable minimum at large field values. While it is possible that our Universe began and remained in the electroweak vacuum at all times, this scenario is extremely fine-tuned from the point of view of initial conditions. This fine-tuning can be ameliorated by the exponential expansion of spacetime during inflation: intriguingly, this requires at least $\sim 40$ e-folds of inflation, tantalizingly close to the $50-60$ e-folds expected from horizon and flatness considerations. The Higgs could thus provide the reason for a prolonged epoch of inflation in our cosmic history. Otherwise, the most natural initial state corresponds to our Universe initialized in the more stable but "wrong" Higgs vacuum, and subsequently driven dynamically to the weak scale vacuum during reheating. An important, hitherto unexplored aspect of this dynamics is that the barrier between the two vacua persists when the electroweak vacuum becomes energetically favorable, becoming arbitrarily small as the temperature increases, and therefore triggers a first-order phase transition. This transition produces ultra-high (megahertz to gigahertz) frequency gravitational waves (GWs), serving as a challenging but unique SM target for GW experiments. Novel pathways for various beyond the Standard Model phenomena such as the production of dark matter and baryon asymmetry also become possible in this configuration.</description>

      <title>Higgs Yukawa coupling constraints on a benchmark one-loop radiative mass model for the bottom, charm and tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of Higgs boson Yukawa couplings to Standard Model (SM) fermions constrain radiative mass models for those species. Such models, motivated by the observed fermion mass hierarchy, act as foils for the SM tree-level mechanism: we cannot claim to have verified the standard mechanism if other possibilities also fit the data well. We construct a benchmark model which generates the top mass at tree level, and the bottom, charm, tau, and tau Dirac neutrino masses at one-loop level. Current theoretical and experimental constraints on the model, including from Higgs decays, demonstrate it possesses viable regions of parameter space. We show that future improvements to measurements will not be able to rule out the model, only increase the scale of new physics required, illustrating how difficult it will be to verify the SM fermion mass generation mechanism with great precision. As a bonus, a dark matter candidate is shown to be capable of reproducing the correct relic density within the permitted parameter space.</description>

      <title>Search for light Dark Sectors with GeV Muon Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-GeV light dark matter often requires new light mediators, such as a dark $Z$ boson in the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ gauge theory. We study the search potential for such a $Z^\prime$ boson via the process $\mu e^- \to \mu e^- X$, with $X$ decaying invisibly, in a muon on-target experiment using a high-intensity 1-10 GeV muon beam from facilities such as HIAF-HIRIBL. Events are identified by the scattered muon and electron from the target using silicon strip detectors in a single-station telescope system. Backgrounds are suppressed through a trained boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier, and activity in downstream subdetectors remains low. This approach can probe a $Z^\prime$ boson in the 10 MeV mass range with improved sensitivity. Nearly three orders of magnitude improvement is achievable with a full multi-telescope station system employing a 160 GeV muon beam at CERN, such as in the MUonE experiment.</description>

      <title>The color force acting on a quark in the pion and nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We entertain the possibility that the phenomena typically attributed to dark matter may have a fundamentally emergent nature, rather than arising from new particle degrees of freedom. To illustrate this idea, we consider a field-theoretic model of a three-form gauge field coupled to a cosmological fluid composed of ordinary matter and radiation. In the absence of interactions, the 3-form gauge theory describes only a global, non-propagating state, which can be associated with dark energy. However, when coupled to the cosmic fluid, the theory gives rise to an emergent, dynamical in-medium state. We identify this emergent state of the 3-form gauge field with dark matter. Thus, our proposal provides a unified framework for the dark sector of the universe within the context of an interacting three-form gauge theory. Furthermore, we speculate that the three-form field may have a gravitational origin, potentially supported by the lepton-number asymmetry in the primordial plasma. If this scenario is correct, conventional direct and indirect searches for dark matter would likely be futile.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the strong decays of the $Y(4660)$ in tetraquark scenario via the QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the enigmatic vector charmonium-like states, we investigate the strong decay behaviors of four kinds of tetraquark states, which are possible candidates for the $Y(4660)$, within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules based on rigorous quark-hadron duality. We take into account the vacuum condensates up to dimension 5 in the QCD side, and obtain the hadronic coupling constants therefore the partial decay widths of those states. The predicted width $61.5\pm7.3\,\rm{MeV}$ is in excellent agreement with the experimental data for the $Y(4660)$, which supports its interpretation as a $[sc][\bar{s}\bar{c}]$ tetraquark state with the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hadron resonant scattering, there are four fundamental resonant parameters: real and imaginary part of the pole position, and the magnitude and the phase of the residue. Out of the four, the last one is the least understood. The search for the residue phase's physical meaning has focused on model-independent phases of the majority of the lowest-mass resonances. Here, we apply a simple mathematical identity to the amplitude in the complex plane to reveal the exact reason for the noticed regularity and show that there is no room for hidden physical variables in the residue phase.</description>

      <title>Impact of reactor antineutrinos on the neutrino floor in low-mass WIMP-like dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar, geoneutrino, diffuse supernova, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within about 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond roughly 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These results establish reactor proximity as a critical site-dependent parameter in defining the neutrino floor and provide guidance for optimizing the design and siting of future low-threshold dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Strongly intensive quantities for rapidity correlations of multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter created in nuclear collisions are typically carried out using event-by-event fluctuations. Well-known way to disentangle statistical and dynamical fluctuations is to construct special observables named strongly intensive which are free from trivial volume fluctuations. Within the color string model behavior of the second-order strongly intensive quantity $\Sigma$ is completely determined by the two-particle correlation function from a single string and the string fusion mechanism. In this paper, we analyze third-order strongly intensive observable for forward-backward rapidity correlations and test its behavior within the PYTHIA8 model.</description>

      <title>Production of Light Dark Particles from Nonlinear Compton Scattering Between Intense Laser and Muon or Proton Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laser of an intense electromagnetic field promotes the studies of strong-field particle physics in high-intensity frontier. Particle accelerator facilities in the world produce high-quality muon and proton beams. In this work, we propose the nonlinear Compton scattering to light dark particles through the collision between intense laser pulse and muon or proton beam. We take light dark photon and axion-like particle as illustrative dark particles. The cross sections of relevant nonlinear Compton scattering to dark photon or axion-like particle are calculated. We also analyze the background processes with missing neutrinos. The prospective sensitivity shows that the laser-induced process provides a complementary and competitive search of new invisible particles lighter than about 1 MeV.</description>

      <title>Parametrisation scale invariance of Parton Distribution Function fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In global PDF analyses, parton distribution functions (PDFs) are parametrised at a fixed input scale $Q_0$ and evolved to higher scales using the DGLAP equations. Since QCD evolution is fully determined within perturbation theory, the fitted PDFs should, in principle, be independent of the arbitrary choice of $Q_0$. In this work, we test this within the NNPDF framework by performing a series of fits at different starting scales, namely $Q_0 \in {1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.65}$ GeV. We find that the resulting PDFs are consistent within uncertainties and the fit quality remains stable across this range, therefore confirming the invariance of PDF determinations with respect to the choice of starting scale.</description>

      <title>Self-Interaction of Super-Resonant Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model, while successful on large cosmological scales, faces challenges on small scales. A promising solution posits that dark matter (DM) exhibits strong self-interaction, enhanced through the narrow resonance or Sommerfeld effects. We demonstrate that the ``super-resonance" phenomenon, combining these effects, significantly amplifies the DM self-scattering cross section, enabling strong self-interactions for DM candidates in the $\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV mass range. This mechanism also enhances the DM annihilation cross section, causing early kinetic decoupling that renders the standard Boltzmann equation inadequate. By implementing coupled Boltzmann equations, we achieve precise calculations of the relic density for super-resonant DM, aligning with observational constraints.</description>

      <title>A Unified Dark-Matter--Driven Relativistic Bondi Route to Black-Hole Growth from Stellar to Supermassive Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of luminous quasars at $z\gtrsim7$ reveal supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with inferred masses $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^9 \, M_\odot$ formed within the first $\sim700$~Myr of cosmic history. Standard growth channels \textrm{ -- } Eddington-limited gas accretion and hierarchical mergers \textrm{ -- } face severe timescale restrictions. We consider a super-Eddington accretion mechanism aided by the Bondi accretion of a minimal model of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We demonstrate that in a {\it critical regime} with a near-relativistic sound speed, the Bondi accretion yields an accretion rate that depends only on the mass $m$ of SIDM, thus it is universal to the ambient environment. This critical accretion mechanism for $m\gtrsim 10^{-2}\; {\rm eV}$ can grow seeds as small as $10\,M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBH) in the early Universe into $10^9$ \textrm{--} $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ SMBHs by $z\sim7$ without fine-tuned environments. Therefore, given a mass distribution of PBHs and a value of $m$, the mass function of primary black holes at late time can be fully determined with masses ranging from stellar to SMBHs. This connects the microscopic physics of dark matter to astrophysical observations of black holes.</description>

      <title>Compton Scattering Total Cross Section at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order and Resummation of Leading Logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compton scattering is a fundamental process in QED with broad applications, yet its theoretical description at high energies is challenged by substantial next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections arising from double-logarithmic enhancements. To address this, we report the first calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) total cross section with full electron mass dependence. Our analysis reveals that the NNLO correction, albeit still containing double logarithms, is numerically small due to a suppressing prefactor. By identifying the origin of these logarithms in a kinematic regime featuring a Glauber electron exchange, we successfully resum the leading logarithmic series to all orders, obtaining a compact result in terms of a modified Bessel function. The all-order structure reveals a suppression mechanism, with double factorial terms in the denominator, which explains the negligible nature of higher-order contributions. The combination of our NNLO calculation and all-orders resummation delivers a reliable and precise prediction, poised to serve the needs of high-precision experiments in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>A Methodology for Developing Foundational Transformer Models in Collider Physics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for training foundational transformer models capable of processing collider data with diverse kinematic signatures. Our universal foundation model is designed for simultaneous analysis of all processes involving from one to four top-quarks production with their corresponding background processes. The approach employs multi-task pre-training on combined datasets of simulated events, enabling the model to capture the full spectrum of interaction physics while extracting universal patterns across different final states prior to task-specific fine-tuning. This unified architecture eliminates the need for separate analysis frameworks for different final signatures and specific tasks. The transformer-based pre-training strategy explicitly preserves unique interaction patterns through adaptive attention mechanisms while establishing cross-process correlations. We plan to demonstrate how this architecture maintains sensitivity to rare high-multiplicity topologies (3t and 4t) without compromising performance on conventional channels ($t\bar{t}$, $tX$, $t\bar{t}H$), effectively bridging the gap between disparate analysis paradigms in collider physics.</description>

      <title>Detecting Parity-Violating Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Pulsar Polarization Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays probe isotropic stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds in the nanohertz band but are insensitive to its parity-violating component. Motivated by recent progress in pulsar polarization arrays, we study the response of pulsar polarimetry to GWs and evaluate its potential to detect circular polarization in isotropic stochastic GW backgrounds, which characterizes parity violation. Based on geometric optics, we derive the rotation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves induced by propagation through a GW background. We show that the cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals isolates the circular polarization component from the GW intensity, sharing the same Hellings-Downs angular pattern. With future facilities such as the SKA, timing-polarimetry correlations could reach sensitivities to the circular polarization of GWs comparable to those of the current astrometric methods.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel and more efficient approach to constructing the relativistic BKW (Bobylev, Krook, and Wu) solution. By introducing a class of ansatz functions for the distribution function, we demonstrate that within this specific ansatz space, only the equilibrium and BKW-type forms yield exact solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. Furthermore, guided by physical insight and drawing upon the framework of relativistic kinetic theory, we derive the Lie algebra of invariant transformations admitted by the relativistic Boltzmann equation. From this algebra, the corresponding symmetry group transformations can be systematically constructed.</description>

      <title>Path integral predictions for pre-asymptotic false vacuum decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When tunneling occurs out of generic initial states, a significant fraction of probability is lost at early times during which the dynamics is governed by excited resonance states. However, first-principles analyses based on path integrals have only captured the leading asymptotic behavior during which the tunneling rate is dominated by the false vacuum contribution. In this work, we discuss the behavior in the pre-asymptotic regime from a first-principles path integral perspective. We demonstrate how the relevant expressions can be evaluated systematically through semi-classical methods in the recently developed steadyon picture. This approach allows one to trace the role of the relevant physical scales, making transparent the underlying assumptions and approximations and offering a clear path to establishing a systematically improvable framework to evaluate tunneling rates non-perturbatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the understanding of real-time path integrals led to the development of the ``steadyon picture'' for the semi-classical calculation of quantum tunneling rates. We discuss tunneling out of a generic localized initial state in this picture and present its application for the important example of a resonance state in a one-dimensional point particle potential. We find that the steadyon picture indeed reproduces existing results obtained using the WKB method. Our analysis furthermore demonstrates how applying this picture to physical states naturally addresses open conceptual questions regarding this framework. Finally, we perform a numerical study for a specific potential. We demonstrate in particular the existence of regimes in which the tunneling rate is dominated by higher resonances, rather than the false vacuum, as well as their importance.</description>

      <title>Massive Inflationary Amplitudes: New Representations and Degenerate Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle model building of cosmological collider physics often involves boost-breaking bilinear mixing between a heavy particle and the nearly massless inflaton mode. In cosmological correlators, such a mixing is obtained by taking a folded limit of a generic tree graph, which is a special case of degenerate kinematics. In this work, we continue our exploration of massive inflationary amplitudes with a focus on degenerate kinematics. With a suitable change of variables, we derive new differential equations and full analytical solutions for generic tree graphs, making it trivial to take the folded limit and partial-energy limit at a vertex. Our result shows that folded tree graphs generally involve functions of smaller transcendental weights than their nondegenerate counterparts. In particular, the inflaton bispectrum with triple massive exchanges can be expressed in terms of a trivariate Kamp\'e de F\'eriet function and simpler hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Excitation factors for horizonless compact objects: long-lived modes, echoes, and greybody factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical investigation of the quasinormal excitation factors of ultracompact horizonless objects. These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding excitation, stability, and echoes in ultracompact horizonless objects, with direct implications for their spectral properties and gravitational wave signatures.</description>

Abstract: We perform a study of electromagnetic radiation in heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Beam Energy Scan (BES) and SPS energies using the iEBE-MUSIC framework, which includes 3D dynamical Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions, MUSIC (3+1)D viscous relativistic hydrodynamics, and the UrQMD hadronic afterburner. The multistage modeling has been calibrated to hadronic data at RHIC-BES energies using a Bayesian analysis. Integrating the thermal photon emission rates with the medium evolution, we study the direct photon yield and elliptic flow and how they vary with collision energy and emission source. We compare with results obtained by the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations. We employ next-to-leading order thermal QCD dilepton emission rates to compute dilepton invariant mass spectra and extract the effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma at different collision energies.</description>

      <title>Learning to Validate Generative Models: a Goodness-of-Fit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end generator for the Large Hadron Collider called FlashSim, trained on jet data, typical in the field of high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration has analyzed a number of cumulants mixing elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), involving up to $8$ particles, in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We unravel an unexpected simplicity in these complex mathematical quantities for collisions at fixed impact parameter. We show that as one increases the order in $v_2$, for a given order in $v_3$, the changes in the cumulants are solely determined by the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane, which originates from the almond-shaped geometry of the overlap area between the colliding nuclei. We derive simple analytic relations between cumulants of different orders on this basis. Some of these relations are in reasonable agreement with existing data. We postulate that agreement will be much improved if the analysis is repeated with a finer centrality binning and a larger pseudorapidity acceptance.</description>

      <title>Gauged Soft Recursion: On-Shell Construction of Goldstone-Gauge Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new on-shell recursion relation for scattering amplitudes involving Nambu-Goldstone bosons with a gauged unbroken symmetry. A central challenge is that gauge interactions break Adler's zero condition for charged scalars, invalidating the standard soft recursion. To overcome this, we introduce a ``gauged soft recursion'' that leverages the soft theorems of the gauge bosons themselves, combined with a novel decomposition of amplitudes into gauge-invariant components where Adler's zero is partially restored. The formalism, which also incorporates internal gauge bosons via angular momentum constraints, enables the systematic construction of tree-level amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone bosons and gauge bosons in both Abelian and non-Abelian theories, as we demonstrate with explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Gauge coupling unification and proton decay via 45 Higgs boson in SU(5) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gauge coupling unification (GCU) and proton decay in a non-supersymmetric SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) incorporating a 45 representation Higgs field. Our analysis is based on the assumption that Georgi-Jarlskog-type mass matrices for fermions are responsible for explaining the mass ratio of the strange quark and the muon. We examine the conditions of GCU, taking into account the possibility that certain components of the 45 Higgs field have masses much smaller than the GUT scale. We have found that to satisfy the GCU conditions, at least two components of the 45 Higgs field should have such small masses. We search the parameter space to identify regions where the GCU conditions are satisfied, in the scenarios where two or three components of the 45 Higgs boson are hierarchically light. If the colored Higgs component of the 45 Higgs boson has a mass much smaller than the GUT scale, proton decay via colored Higgs boson exchange can occur with an observably large rate. We estimate the mass bounds for the colored Higgs component from the proton decay search at Super- Kamiokande and thereby further restrict the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Proton Decay and Gauge Coupling Unification in an Extended SU(5) GUT with 45-Dimensional Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of an extended SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) that incorporates a 45-dimensional Higgs representation to address the shortcomings of the minimal SU(5) GUT, such as the inability to generate realistic fermion mass hierarchies and insufficient proton stability. By considering a hierarchical mass spectrum for the scalar components of the 45-Higgs, we demonstrate that successful gauge coupling unification (GCU) can be achieved. The color octet scalar, color triplet scalar, and color anti-triplet scalar play crucial roles in realizing GCU when their masses are significantly lighter than other components of the 45-Higgs. We focuses on the proton decay channels mediated by the exchange of the color anti-triplet scalar. Assuming that the 45-Higgs couples to all three generations of fermions, we determine the 45-Higgs Yukawa couplings with which the observed fermion mass matrices at low energies are realized. We calculate proton decay rates using the Yukawa couplings obtained from renormalization group evolutions and matching conditions at the GUT scale, thereby exploring the dependence of proton decay rates on model parameters. We find that the $p \to \nu \pi$ mode imposes the most stringent constraint on the mass of the color anti-triplet scalar $M_{S_1}$. We also study the correlations between the lower bounds on $M_{S_1}$ derived from different proton decay modes.</description>

      <title>Two-loop running effects in Higgs physics in Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the renormalization group equations within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory and compute two-loop contributions proportional to the top quark Yukawa coupling for the operator generating an effective Higgs-gluon coupling, focusing on the Yukawa-like operator. These two-loop running effects are relevant for processes where the effective Higgs-gluon coupling contributes at a lower loop order compared to the Standard Model contribution and where a dynamical scale choice is adopted. Such a situation arises, for instance, in the Higgs transverse momentum distribution and Higgs pair production. We investigate the phenomenological impact of our computations on these two processes and find that the two-loop contributions are significant and can lead to deviations of up to 20\% in the scenarios we consider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a general relativistic Hamiltonian valid for both bound and scattering systems by reducing the four-component Dirac equation to a two-component Dirac-Pauli form. Unlike conventional approaches, our formulation includes first-order relativistic corrections in a compact, gauge-consistent expression applicable to arbitrary electromagnetic fields - including non-uniform and time-dependent configurations. As an application, we compute the O(alpha^2) relativistic correction to the Lande g-factor in hydrogen-like atoms, revealing a novel mj^2-dependent term that generalizes the Breit result. This correction is experimentally testable in Penning trap spectroscopy. We further show that relativistic effects become comparable to QFT corrections in highly charged ions where Z ~ 1/sqrt(alpha)</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors and the $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extraction from $B_{l4}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $B_{l4}$ decays offer an independent method for determining the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $\vert V_{ub} \vert$, with a QCD analysis of the underlying $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors serving as a crucial component. We present a comprehensive QCD analysis of the $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors within the framework of light-cone sum rules, employing two-pion light-cone distribution amplitudes. For the first time, we derive the twist-three $2\pi$DAs explicitly by exploiting the conformal symmetry of massless QCD. This breakthrough enables the first systematic calculation of higher-power corrections to the $B \to \pi\pi$-type transitions. Leveraging the recently measured partial decay fractions of $B^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- l^+ \nu_l$ by the Belle detector, we obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert = \left( 4.27 \pm 0.49\vert_{\rm data} \pm 0.55\vert_{\rm LCSRs} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ within the dominant region of the $\rho$ resonance. We clarify that the relatively small value of $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extracted from $B \to \rho l \nu$, when compared to the golden channel $B \to \pi l\nu$, arises due to the finite width and nonresonant effects. We anticipate future measurements of purely isovector and isoscalar $B_{l4}$ decays, which will aid in reducing uncertainties by enhancing our understanding of the $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the two-pion distribution amplitudes through heavy flavor decays.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons from Dissipative Spin Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for spin dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Under the approximation of small polarization, macroscopic spin degrees of freedom decouple from the background, and their evolution equations and transport coefficients have been computed using quantum kinetic theory of massive particles with nonlocal collisions. Employing this theory, we numerically solve dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We explore three interaction scenarios between constituent particles and apply this framework to compute both global and local spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. Our results show that the initially vanishing spin potential relaxes toward thermal vorticity, driving global polarization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sign of longitudinal polarization is sensitive to the interaction type, emphasizing the need for a consistent treatment of dissipative effects in spin hydrodynamics to describe experimental data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sensitivity for Di-Higgs Boson Searches Using Anomaly Detection and Supervised Machine Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores different strategies for enhancing sensitivity to new heavy resonances that decay into two or more Higgs bosons. This is achieved using two neural network architectures: an unsupervised autoencoder for anomaly detection and a supervised classifier. The autoencoder is trained on a small fraction of Standard Model (SM) Monte Carlo simulated events to calculate the loss distribution for input events, aiding in determining the extent to which events can be considered anomalous. The supervised classifier uses the same inputs but is trained on events simulated using both beyond Standard Model (BSM) and SM processes. By applying selection cuts to the output scores, we compare the sensitivities of the two approaches.</description>

      <title>Impact on $L$-observables of a new combined analysis of $B_{d,s}\to K^{(*)}$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of a combined analysis of $B_{d,s}\to K^{(*)}$ form factors on a set of $L$-observables. The $L$-observables are constructed from ratios of branching fractions in $B_{s}\to VV,PP,PV$ versus $B_d \to VV,PP,PV$ decays with $P=K^0,\bar{K}^0$ and $V=K^{*0},\bar{K}^{*0}$, thereby partially reducing their hadronic uncertainties. We show the change of the Standard Model predictions of the $L$-observables under different determinations of the ratio of the relevant form factors (with correlations) including lattice QCD data and a novel light-cone sum rule analysis. In addition, we provide precise results for all $B_{d,s} \to K^{(*)}$ form factors in machine-readable files. We find that the inclusion of our up-to-date results, as well as the use or omission of lattice QCD data for the form factors, has a significant impact on the $L$-observables. We also discuss how the New Physics interpretation is affected by the updated form factors and present revised predictions for the mechanism identified in our analysis of $B \to VP$ decays, now employing more suitable new experimental observables defined in this paper.</description>

      <title>SMEFT ATLAS: The Landscape Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) based on the unbroken gauge group $\text{SU(3)}_C\otimes\text{SU(2)}_L\otimes\text{U(1)}_Y$ and containing only particles of the Standard Model (SM) has developed in the last decade to a mature field. It is the framework to be used in the energy gap from scales sufficiently higher than the electroweak scale up to the lowest energy scale at which new particles show up. We summarize the present status of this theory with a particular emphasize on its role in the indirect search for new physics (NP). While flavour physics of both quarks and leptons is the main topic of our review, we also discuss electric dipole moments, anomalous magnetic moments $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, $Z$-pole observables, Higgs observables and high-$p_T$ scattering processes within the SMEFT. We group the observables into ten classes and list for each class the most relevant operators and the corresponding renormalization group equations (RGEs). We exhibit the correlations between different classes implied both by the operator mixing and the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry. Our main goal is to provide an insight into the complicated operator structure of this framework which hopefully will facilitate the identification of valid ultraviolet completions behind possible anomalies observed in future data. Numerous colourful charts, and 85 tables, while representing rather complicated RG evolution from the NP scale down to the electroweak scale, beautify the involved SMEFT landscape. Over 950 references to the literature underline the importance and the popularity of this field. We discuss both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as their interplay. This allows us eventually to present an atlas of different landscapes beyond the SM that includes heavy gauge bosons and scalars, vector-like quarks and leptons and leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>Do massive neutrino states really exist?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In neutrino physics, while massive states define neutrino masses, the flavor states participating in weak interactions are governed by an off-diagonal mass matrix. This work examines the complete form of this mass matrix, both for a two-flavor toy model and for the general three-flavor case under two distinct mass hierarchies. Using the Monte Carlo method, we estimate the mass matrix parameters and demonstrate how its structure governs the dependence of the interaction cross section on the mass hierarchy (normal vs inverted). This formalism enables the treatment of processes involving neutrino exchange through a non-diagonal propagator, corresponding to a quantum field theory description. Numerical estimates for a local charged-lepton interaction via virtual neutrino exchange yield a ratio of electron-antimuon (lepton flavor violating) to electron-positron cross sections on the order of $10^{-51}$. Furthermore, the cross section exhibits a fundamental dependence on the lightest neutrino mass, which differs drastically between the two hierarchies. For macroscopic processes, this propagator formalism reproduces the standard neutrino oscillation probability by operating directly with the non-diagonal mass matrix, thereby circumventing the wave-packet formalism and confirming the validity of this approach.</description>

      <title>On the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^+_s\pi^{\pm}$ mass spectra in the $D_{s1}(2536) \to D^+_s\pi^+\pi^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have carried out an evaluation of the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ and $D_s^+ \pi^+$ mass distributions in the $D_{s1}(2536)$ decay to $D_s^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$, from the perspective that the $D_{s1}(2536)$ is a molecular state, mostly made from $K^*D$ in $I=0$. We are able to obtain, not only the mass distributions, but the branching ratio of this decay. The shape of the mass distributions differ appreciably from those of the analogous reaction $D_{s1}(2460)\to D_s^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$, which has been measured by the LHCb collaboration and analyzed theoretically from the perspective that the $D_{s1}(2460)$ is a molecular state of $D^*K$, showing a good agreement with the data. In spite of the analogy with the $D_{s1}(2460)$ decay, the dynamical differences in the decay mechanism are important, since now the $f_0(500)$ resonance is not generated, while it was the dominant mechanism in the $D_{s1}(2460)\to D_s^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay. Nonetheless, we find striking differences in the mass distributions compared with phase space as a consequence of the decay mechanism. The branching ratio obtained is an order of magnitude bigger than the one of the $D_{s1}(2460)\to D_s^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ reaction, mostly due to the larger available phase space. We also show that the shape of the distributions obtained from the molecular picture are quite different from those obtained based on a $q\bar{q}$ picture. We conclude that measuring the shape of the mass distributions and the total strength of the decay mode, should be very valuable to learn about the structure of the $D_{s1}(2536)$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the electroweak transition form factors of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_c$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered. In QCD side, the perturbative part and the contributions of vacuum condensates up to dimension 8 are also included. With the estimated form factors, we study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ ($l=e,\mu$ and $\tau$). Our results for the branching ratios of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ are comparable with experimental data and the results from other collaborations. In addition, our prediction for the branching ratio of $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ can provide a valuable reference for future experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Measuring Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Electroweak Phase Transition and Higgs Self-Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the complete process of using space-based gravitational wave detectors to measure properties of the stochastic gravitational wave background resulting from a first order electroweak phase transition, to infer the parameters governing the phase transition dynamics as well as that of the underlying particle physics model, and eventually to make predictions for important physical observables such as the Higgs cubic and quartic self-couplings which are difficult to measure at colliders. This pipeline is based on a frequency domain simulation of the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, taking into account dominant instrumental noises and astrophysical background, where the data analysis is carried out using both the Fisher information matrix and Bayesian inference with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo numerical sampling. We have applied this framework to the simplest extension of the Standard Model, the singlet extension, and show the measured uncertainties of the parameters at various levels of inference, and show that the Higgs cubic and also the quartic coupling can be highly constrained from gravitational wave measurement. We also show the impact from the problem of parameter degeneracy, highlighting the corresponding limitation on parameter inference and on making predictions.</description>

      <title>Phase transition during inflation and the gravitational wave signal at pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00070</link>

Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal offers a promising window into the dynamics of the early universe. The recent results from the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could be the first glimpse of such new physics. In particular, they could point to new details during inflation, which can not be probed by other means. We explore the possibility that the new results could come from the secondary GWs sourced by curvature perturbations, generated by a first-order phase transition during inflation. Based on the results of a field-theoretic lattice simulation of the phase transition process, we show that the GW signal generated through this mechanism can account for the new results from the PTAs. We analyze the spectral shape of the signal in detail. Future observations can use such information to distinguish the GW signal considered here from other possible sources.</description>

      <title>On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of useful criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.</description>

      <title>Confined-deconfined interface tension and latent heat in SU(N) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high-precision lattice results for the confined-deconfined interface tension and the latent heat of pure SU($N$) gauge theories up to $N=10$ and investigate their asymptotic $N$-dependency. For both quantities we observe the leading $N^2$ behaviour and subleading corrections, with the result for the interface tension $\sigma/T_c^3 = 0.0182(7) N^2 - 0.194(15)$ and for the latent heat $L/T_c^4 = 0.360(6) N^2 - 1.88(17)$. We use the \emph{mixed phase ensemble} method - where the system is constrained so that half of the volume is in the confined phase and the other half in the deconfined phase - and the interface tension is obtained by measuring the capillary wave fluctuation spectra of the interfaces between the two phases. The method bypasses supercritical slowing down from which other methods for determining the interface tension suffer, and as a by-product produces accurate estimates of the critical inverse gauge coupling as a function of the inverse temperature. We use the latter to determine the lattice beta function values, required to compute the latent heat from the discontinuity in the average plaquette action across the confined-deconfined transition.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Hubble tension with a cascade decaying dark matter sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hubble tension can be alleviated by altering either early- or late-time $\Lambda$CDM. So far, extensive studies have shown that only early dark energy or ad hoc combinations of those two-fold effects can reduce the tension to $3\sigma$ level or lower. In this work, we improve the latter solution by considering a cascade decaying dark matter sector, where a parent particle produces relativistic dark matter in the early Universe and the dark matter subsequently decays to neutrinos in the late-time Universe. We parametrize this model with four model parameters, carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to Planck 2018+BAO+Pantheon data sets, and compare it to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits, neutrino flux bounds, Planck data about matter power spectrum, and structure formation constraint. Within parameter regions reducing the Hubble tension to $3.2\sigma$ and compatible with the existing constraints, the main phenomenological features include a larger $S_{8}\sim 0.84$, smaller $n_{s}\sim 0.95$ and larger matter power spectrum relative to the $\Lambda$CDM, which are left for future tests.</description>

      <title>Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.</description>

      <title>Two decades of algorithmic Feynman integral reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a historiographical review of algorithms and computer codes developed for solving integration-by-parts relations for Feynman integrals. This procedure is one of the key steps in the evaluation of Feynman integrals, since it enables to express integrals belonging to a given family as linear combinations of master integrals. In this review, we restrict ourselves to considering general algorithms which can, in principle, be applied to any family of Feynman integrals.</description>
