      <title>Triply charm and bottom tetraquarks in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the singly, doubly and fully charmed tetraquark candidates, $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, $T^+_{cc}(3875)$ and $X(6900)$ are experimentally reported by the LHCb collaboration. Hence, it is quite necessary to implement a theoretical investigation on the triply heavy tetrquarks. In this study, the S-wave triply charm and bottom tetraquarks, $\bar{Q}Q\bar{q}Q$ $(q=u,\,d,\,s;\,Q=c,\,b)$, with spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$, isospin $I=0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ are systematically studied in a constituent quark model. Particularly, a complete S-wave tetraquark configurations, which include the meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type arrangements of quarks, along with all allowed color structures, are comprehensively considered. A high accuracy and efficient computational approach, the Gaussian expansion method (GEM), in cooperation with a powerful complex-scaling method (CSM), which is quite ingenious in dealing with the bound and resonant state of a multiquark system simultaneously, are adopted in solving the complex scaled Schr\"odinger equation. This theoretical framework has already been successfully applied in various tetra- and penta-quark systems. Bound state of triply heavy tetraquark system is unavailable in our study, nevertheless, in a fully coupled-channel calculation by the CSM, several narrow resonances are found in each $I(J^P)$ quantum states of the charm and bottom sector. In particular, triply charm and bottom tetraquark resonances are obtained in $5.59-5.94$ GeV and $15.31-15.67$ GeV, respectively. Compositeness of exotic states, such as the inner quark distance, magnetic moment and dominant component, are also analyzed. These exotic hadrons in triply heavy sector are expected to be confirmed in future high energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Three loop QCD corrections to the heavy-light form factors: fermionic contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytic results for three-loop fermionic corrections to the heavy-light form factors in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Specifically, we present all light quark contributions and contributions from two heavy quark loops. We use the method of differential equations to compute all relevant three-loop master integrals. The results for all these contributions are expressed in terms of harmonic polylogarithms and generalized harmonic polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and Flavor in Multi-Higgs Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of multi-Higgs doublet extensions of the Standard Model that solves the strong CP problem with profound consequences for the flavor sector. The Yukawa matrices are constrained to have many zero entries by a "Higgs-Flavor" symmetry, $G_{\rm HF}$, that acts on Higgs and quark fields. The violation of both CP and $G_{\rm HF}$ occurs in the Higgs mass matrix so that, for certain choices of $G_{\rm HF}$ charges, the strong CP parameter $\bar{\theta}$ is zero at tree-level. Radiative corrections to $\bar{\theta}$ are computed in this class of theories. They vanish in realistic two-Higgs doublet models with $G_{\rm HF} = \mathbb{Z}_3$. We also construct realistic three-Higgs models with $G_{\rm HF} = \rm U(1)$, where the one-loop results for $\bar{\theta}$ are model-dependent. Requiring $\bar{\theta}&lt; 10^{-10}$ has important implications for the flavor problem by constraining the Yukawa coupling and Higgs mass matrices. Contributions to $\bar{\theta}$ from higher-dimension operators are computed at 1-loop and can also be sufficiently small, although the hierarchy problem of this class of theories is worse than in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Momentum shift and on-shell recursion relation for electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the All-Line Transverse (ALT) shift which we developed for on-shell recursion of amplitudes for particles of any mass. We discuss the validity of the shift for general theories of spin $\leq$ 1, and illustrate the connection between Ward identity and constructibility for massive spin-1 amplitude under the ALT shift. We apply the shift to the electroweak theory, and various four-point scattering amplitudes among electroweak gauge bosons and fermions are constructed. We show explicitly that the four-point gauge boson contact terms in massive electroweak theory automatically arise after recursive construction, independent of UV completion, and they automatically cancel the terms growing as (energy)$^4$ at high energy. We explore UV completion of the electroweak theory that cancels the remaining (energy)$^2$ terms and impose unitarity requirements to constrain additional couplings. The ALT shift framework allows consistent treatment in dealing with contact term ambiguities for renormalizable massive and massless theories, which we show can be useful in studying real-world amplitudes with massive spinors.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Matter Production through the Bubble Expansion Mechanism: The Boosting Role of Non-Renormalizable Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Bubble Expansion mechanism for the production of scalar dark matter during a first-order phase transition in the early Universe. Seeking for a dark matter energy density in agreement with observations, we study different non-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter species and the field undergoing the transition. The resulting relic abundance is shown to display a strong dependence on the Lorentz boost factor associated to the bubble wall motion, with this dependence becoming more significant the higher the dimension of the non-renormalizable interaction. This allows for observational compatibility across a wide range of dark matter masses and transition temperatures, typically excluded in renormalizable scenarios. For a transition around the electroweak scale, the associated gravitational wave spectrum is also within the reach of future detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review some aspects of antenna subtraction at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD and provide motivation for its extension to N$^3$LO. Next, I introduce the antenna functions required for the construction of infrared counterterms for final-state radiation at this order. Lastly, I describe the evaluation of the antenna functions and their phase-space integration, first presented in [1-3], and I elaborate on their application to precision observables in jet production at lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>The Non-Relativistic Effective Field Theory Of Dark Matter-Electron Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic excitations in atomic, molecular, and crystal targets are at the forefront of the ongoing search for light, sub-GeV dark matter (DM). In many light DM-electron interactions the energy and momentum deposited is much smaller than the electron mass, motivating a non-relativistic (NR) description of the electron. Thus, for any target, light DM-electron phenomenology relies on understanding the interactions between the DM and electron in the NR limit. In this work we derive the NR effective field theory (EFT) of general DM-electron interactions from a top-down perspective, starting from general high-energy DM-electron interaction Lagrangians. This provides an explicit connection between high-energy theories and their low-energy phenomenology in electron excitation based experiments. Furthermore, we derive Feynman rules for the DM-electron NR EFT, allowing observables to be computed diagrammatically, which can systematically explain the presence of in-medium screening effects in general DM models. We use these Feynman rules to compute absorption, scattering, and dark Thomson scattering rates for a wide variety of high-energy DM models.</description>

      <title>Implications of Sgr A$^\ast$ on the $\gamma$-rays searches of Bino Dark Matter with $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of dark matter density spike around the Milky Way's supermassive black hole (SMBH), Sgr A$^*$, in probing the Bino-dominated neutralino dark matter (DM) $\tilde \chi_1^0$ within the MSSM, which typically produces relatively faint signals in the conventional DM halos. In particular, we explore the indirect search prospects of sub-TeV Bino-Higgsino and Bino-Wino-Higgsino DM in the MSSM, consistent with the supersymmetric predictions required to explain the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Typical over-abundance of Bino DM is ameliorated with slepton and/or Wino coannihilations. The lightest neutralino, thus, may be associated with a compressed supersymmetric particle spectrum, which, in general, is difficult to probe at conventional LHC searches. Similarly, for a rather tiny Higgsino mixing, $\tilde \chi_1^0$ does not offer much prospect to assess its predictions at dark matter direct detection searches. Accommodating the inclusive effects of density spike, here, we present the requisite boost factor to facilitate $\gamma-$ray searches of Bino-dominated DM in the MSSM, especially focusing on the Fermi-LAT and HESS observations.</description>

      <title>Non-linear gauge-Higgs CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical element of the LHC physics program is the search for an additional source of CP violation. This is largely unexplored in the context of non-linear Higgs physics, which is naturally described in Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). Relevant new higher-dimensional operators modify the production rate and branching ratios of the Higgs boson, de-correlating different Higgs multiplicities. In this work, we consider single Higgs and Higgs pair production via weak boson fusion from the perspective of gauge-Higgs CP violation through the lens of Higgs non-linearity. This generalizes existing rate-based searches and analyses by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Particular focus is given to the phenomenological differences in the expected BSM sensitivity pattern when comparing HEFT constraints with Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) limits.</description>

      <title>Exotic Particles at the DUNE Near Detector from Charged Pion Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-target proton-beam experiments produce a multitude of charged pions that rescatter in the beam dump. These charged pion scattering events can be an additional irreducible source of exotic particles which couple to photons or hadrons. We analyze the sensitivity of the DUNE Near Detector complex to millicharged particles (MCPs) and heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) with low-energy couplings to gluons. Using the framework of chiral perturbation theory, we demonstrate regimes of parameter space where the charged pion production channel dominates over previously-considered production mechanisms for both MCPs and ALPs, thereby improving the sensitivity of DUNE to these new particles compared to previous studies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on light dark sector particles from lifetime difference of heavy neutral mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy meson decays with missing energy in the final state offer interesting avenues to search for light invisible new physics such as dark matter (DM). In this context, we show that such NP interactions also affect lifetime difference in neutral meson-antimeson mixing. We consider general dimension-six effective quark interactions involving a pair of DM particles and calculate their contributions to lifetime difference in beauty and charm meson systems. We use the latest data on mixing observables to constrain the relevant effective operators. We find that lifetime differences provide novel and complementary flavor constraints compared to those obtained from heavy meson decays.</description>

      <title>Improved constraint on Higgs boson self-couplings with quartic and cubic power dependence in the cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise information on the Higgs boson self-couplings provides the foundation for unveiling the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. Due to the scarcity of Higgs boson pair events at the LHC, only loose limits have been obtained. This is based on the assumption that the cross section is a quadratic function of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling in the $\kappa$ framework. However, if higher-order corrections of virtual Higgs bosons are included, the function form would dramatically change. In particular, new quartic and cubic power dependence on the trilinear Higgs self-coupling would appear. To get this new function form, we have performed a specialized renormalization procedure suitable for tracking all the Higgs self-couplings in each calculation step. Moreover, we introduce renormalization of the scaling parameter in the $\kappa$ framework to ensure the cancellation of all ultraviolet divergences. With the new function forms of the cross sections in both the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion channels, the upper limit of $\kappa_{\lambda_3}=\lambda_{\rm 3H}/\lambda_{\rm 3H}^{\rm SM}$ by the ATLAS (CMS) collaboration is reduced from 6.6 (6.49) to 5.4 (5.37). However, it is still hard to extract a meaningful constraint on the quartic Higgs self-coupling $\lambda_{\rm 4H}$ from Higgs boson pair production data. We also present the invariant mass distributions of the Higgs boson pair at different values of $\kappa_{\lambda}$, which could help to set optimal cuts in the experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Standard Model anomalies and vacuum stability for lepton portals with extra $U(1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental values of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ and of the $W$ boson mass $m_{_W}$ have both indicated significant deviations from the SM predictions, motivating the exploration of extensions with extra particles and symmetries. We revisit a lepton portal model with $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry where an extra Higgs doublet, a scalar singlet and one $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like fermion are introduced. In this model, $(g-2)_\mu$ can be explained by extra one-loop contributions from the vector-like lepton and the $Z'$ boson, whereas $m_{_W}$ can be increased by a tree-level mixing between the $Z$ and $Z'$. Setting the $Z'$ and lepton couplings at low energies to account for the SM anomalies, we perform a Renormalization Group analysis to investigate on the high-energy behaviour of the model, in particular on the issue of vacuum stability. We find that in the alignment limit for the two Higgs doublets, the Landau pole and the scale where perturbativity is lost are of order $10-100\,{\rm TeV}$, not far from the scales experimentally reached so far, and sensibly lower than the stability scale. We show how the Landau pole can be increased up to $\sim10^9\,{\rm GeV}$ in a misaligned scenario where the experimental anomalies are still accommodated and a positive shift of the Higgs quartic coupling to improve stability can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Holographic Schwinger Effect in Flavor-Dependent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic Schwinger effect is investigated in systems with Nf = 0, Nf = 2, and Nf = 2+1 using the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, incorporating equation of state and baryon number susceptibility information from lattice QCD. It is found that the critical electric field is smallest for Nf = 0, indicating that the Schwinger effect is more likely to occur than in systems with Nf = 2 and Nf = 2+ 1. The critical electric field decreases with increasing chemical potential and temperature across all systems. Additionally, potential analysis confirms that the maximum total potential energy increases with the number of flavors, suggesting that existing particles may reduce the probability of particle pair production.</description>

      <title>Approximate magic symmetry in a cobimaximal scenario of Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The searches for an underlying pattern in neutrino masses have motivated different proposals for textures in the neutrino mass matrix, which is also related to particular arranges of the mixing matrix. The current precise determinations of neutrino mixings have discarded some of the most studied proposals, such as the one involving a $\mu-\tau$ exchange symmetry. In this work, we investigate the relation of a still allowed $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry with the constraints of a magic pattern in the neutrino mass matrix. We show that both conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously in an exact but rather in an approximate way. Such considerations are used to restrict the values of CP-violating phases and some observables, like the neutrinoless double beta decay amplitude and the solar angle, that can be explored with forthcoming results.</description>

      <title>Strong-Coupling Extrapolation of Gell-Mann--Low Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gell-Mann-Low functions can be calculated by means of perturbation theory and expressed as truncated series in powers of asymptotically small coupling parameters. However, it is necessary to know there behavior at finite values of the parameter and, moreover, their behavior at asymptotically large coupling parameters is also important. The problem of extrapolation of weak-coupling expansions to the region of finite and even infinite coupling parameters is considered. A method is suggested allowing for such an extrapolation. The basics of the method are described and illustrations of its applications are given for the examples where its accuracy and convergence can be checked. It is shown that in some cases the method allows for the exact reconstruction of the whole functions from their weak-coupling asymptotic expansions. Gell-Mann-Low functions in multicomponent field theory, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum chromodynamics are extrapolated to their strong-coupling limits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameters of the heavy four-quark scalar meson $T_{\mathrm{2bc}}=bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are calculated by means of the sum rule method. This structure is considered as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and antidiquark components. The mass and current coupling of $T_{ \mathrm{2bc}}$ are evaluated in the context of the two-point sum rule approach. The full width of this tetraquark is estimated by taking into account two types of its possible strong decay channels. First class includes dissociation of $T_{\mathrm{2bc}}$ to mesons $\eta_c\eta_{b}$, $ B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, $B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{+}(1^3P_{0})B_{c}^{\ast-}$. Another type of processes are generated by annihilations $\overline{b}b \to \overline{q}q$ of constituent $b$-quarks which produces the final-state charmed meson pairs $D^{+}D^{-}$, $D^{0} \overline{D}^{0}$, $D^{*+}D^{*-}$, and $D^{*0}\overline{D}^{*0}$. Partial width all of these decays are found using the three-point sum rule method which is required to calculate strong couplings at corresponding meson-meson-tetraquark vertices. Predictions obtained for the mass $m=(12697 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T_{\mathrm{2bc}}]=(142.4 \pm 16.9)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the state $T_{\mathrm{2bc}}$ are compared with alternative results, and are useful for further experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>ALPs and HNLs at LHC and Muon Colliders: Uncovering New Couplings and Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) and heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are two well-motivated classes of particles beyond the Standard Model. It is intriguing to explore the new detection opportunities that may arise if both particle types coexist. Part of the authors already investigated this scenario in a previous publication, within a simplified model containing an ALP and a single HNL, identifying particularly promising processes that could be searched for at the LHC. In this paper, we first consider the same setup with a broader range of both production processes and final states, both at the High-Luminosity LHC and at a future muon collider. Subsequently, we expand it to the more realistic scenario with at least two HNLs, necessary to describe the active neutrino masses. Different phenomenological signals are expected and we examine the complexities that emerge in this setup. This study paves the way for dedicated analysis at (forthcoming) colliders, potentially pinpointing the dynamics of ALPs and HNLs.</description>

      <title>Z_5 two-component dark matter in the Type-II seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Z5 two-component dark matter model within the framework of the Type-II seesaw mechanism. Due to the new annihilation processes related to triplets, the light component cannot necessarily be dominant in the dark matter relic density, which is different from the Z5 two-component dark matter model in the SM. The model is considered to explain the excess of electron-positron flux measured by the AMS-02 Collaborations in this work, which is encouraged by the decay of the triplets arising from dark matter annihilations in the Galactic halo. We discuss the cases of the light and heavy components determining dark matter density within a viable parameter space satisfying relic density and direct detection constraints, and by fitting the antiproton spectrum observed in the PAMELA and AMS experiments, we find that the parameter space is flexible and the electron-positron flux excess can be obtained in both cases with the mass of two dark matter particles being larger than that of the triplets'.</description>

      <title>Attractor for 1+1D viscous hydrodynamics with general rapidity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attractor, supposed to be one of the possible answer for the early applicability of hydrodynamics in the evolution with different initial conditions, has attracted great attention to the fast decreasing of degrees of freedom in heavy ion collision. We found attractor behaviors for 1+1D viscous hydrodynamics with general rapidity distribution based on MIS theory. Meanwhile, we also observe that a rapid expansion in the fluid velocity is essential for a rapid early time attractor.</description>

      <title>Locality in collider tests of Quantum Mechanics with top quark pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tests of quantum properties of fundamental particles in high energy colliders are starting to appear. However, such experiments may suffer from the locality loophole. We argue for criteria that take into account the space-like separation between measurements for the case of spin correlations in top quark pairs produced at the LHC. We derive bounds considering three different definitions of what constitutes the quantum measurement - the decay of top quarks, the decay of W bosons, and the stable decay products contacting a macroscopic device.</description>

      <title>Unitarization of electron scattering with an external potential at NLO in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have calculated the one-loop scattering amplitude of an electron by an external Coulomb potential in QED free of infrared divergences. This feature is achieved by applying the Faddeev-Kulish formalism, which implies a redefinition of both the asymptotic electronic states and of the $S$ matrix. Additionally, we have also derived the infrared-finite one-loop partial-wave amplitudes for this process by applying a recent method in the literature. Next, these partial-wave amplitudes are unitarized based on analyticity and unitarity by employing three different methods of unitarization: the algebraic $N/D$ method, the Inverse Amplitude Method and the first iterated $N/D$ method. Then, we have studied several partial waves both for physical momentum and for complex ones to look for bound-state poles. The binding momentum for the fundamental bound state in $S$ wave is discussed with special detail. This is a wide-ranging method for calculating nonperturbative partial-wave amplitudes for infinite-range interactions that could be applied to many other systems.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and nonperturbative QCD corrections in polarized nucleon structure functions and spin asymmetries of nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the deep inelastic scattering of polarized charged leptons from polarized nucleon targets and evaluated the polarized structure functions $g_{1,2}(x,Q^2)$ for protons and neutrons as well as the nucleon asymmetries $A_{1p}(x,Q^2)$ and $A_{2p}(x,Q^2)$ for protons. The higher order perturbative corrections up to the next-to-next-to-the-leading order (NNLO) using the parameterization of LSS05 polarized parton distribution functions in the 3-flavor MSbar scheme and the nonperturbative corrections viz. the twist-3 corrections and target mass corrections (TMC) have been included in the calculations. The numerical results for the polarized nucleon structure functions and the proton asymmetries are presented and compared with the experimental results. The sum rule integrals of the nucleon structure functions corresponding to the Ellis-Jaffe, Bjorken, Gottfried and Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rules have been evaluated numerically and are compared with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of bubble size distributions in a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi balls (FBs) and primordial black holes (PBHs) can be copiously produced during a dark first-order phase transition (FOPT). The radius distribution of false vacuum bubbles causes FBs and PBHs to have extended mass distributions. We show how gravitational wave (GW), microlensing and Hawking evaporation signals deviate from the case of monochromatic distributions. The peak of the GW spectrum is shifted to lower frequencies and the spectrum is broadened at frequencies below the peak frequency. Thus, the radius distribution of true vacuum bubbles introduces another uncertainty in the evaluation of the GW spectrum from a FOPT. The extragalactic gamma-ray signal at AMEGO-X/e-ASTROGAM from PBH evaporation may evince a break in the power-law spectrum between 5~MeV and 10~MeV for an extended PBH mass distribution. Optical microlensing surveys may observe PBHs lighter than $10^{-10}M_\odot$, which is not possible for monochromatic mass distributions. This expands the FOPT parameter space that can be explored with microlensing.</description>

      <title>Model-independent analysis of new physics effects in $B\rightarrow K^*_2(1430)\mu^+ \mu^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration provided updated measurements for the lepton flavour ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$. The currently observed values align with the predictions of the standard model. In light of these recent updates, our investigation delves into the repercussions of new physics characterized by universal couplings to electrons and muons. We specifically focus on their impact on various observables within the $B\to K_2^*(1430)(\to K\pi)\mu^+ \mu^-$ decay. These observables include the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{FB}$), longitudinal polarization asymmetry ($F_L$), and a set of optimized observables ($P_i$). Our findings indicate that the branching ratio of $B\to K_2^*(\to K\pi)\mu^+ \mu^-$ decay can be suppressed up to $25\%$ for various new physics solutions. Furthermore, all permissible new physics scenarios demonstrate finite enhancement in the muon forward-backward asymmetry $(A_{FB})$ as well as an increase in the value of the optimized angular observable $P_2$. Moreover, in the presence of new physics zero crossing points for $A_{FB}$ and $P_2$ shift towards higher $q^2$. The current data have a mild deviation from SM predictions in $P_5'$ observable in the low-$q^2$ bin. We also explored massive $Z'$ models, which can generate universal 1D new physics scenarios, characterized by $C_9^{NP}&lt;0$, $C_9^{NP}=-C_{10}^{NP}$, and $C_9^{NP}=-C_9'$. Using additional constraints coming from $B_s-\overline{B_s}$ mixing and neutrino trident process, we find that the conclusions of the model-independent analysis remain valid.</description>

      <title>Power counting of the pion-dilaton effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confining QCD-like theories close to the conformal window have a ``walking'' coupling. This is believed to lead to a light singlet scalar meson in the low-energy spectrum, a dilaton, which is the pseudo Nambu--Goldstone boson for the approximate scale symmetry. Extending chiral perturbation theory to include the dilaton requires a new small parameter to control the dilaton mass and its interactions. In our previous work we derived a systematic power counting for the dilaton couplings by matching the effective low-energy theory to the underlying theory using mild assumptions. In this paper we examine two alternative power countings which were proposed in the literature based on a phenomenological picture for the conformal transition. We find that one of these power countings fails, in fact, to generate a systematic expansion; the other coincides with the power counting we derived. We also point out that the so-called $\Delta$-potential coincides with the tree-level potential of the former, invalid, power counting.</description>

      <title>Effects of primordial fluctuations on relic neutrino simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After decoupling, relic neutrinos traverse the evolving gravitational imhomogeneities along their trajectories. Once they turn non-relativistic, this results in a significant amplification of the anisotropies in the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Past studies have reconstructed the phase-space distribution of relic neutrinos from the local distribution of matter (accounting for the Milky Way halo and the surrounding large-scale structures), but have neglected the C$\nu$B anisotropies in the initial conditions of neutrino trajectories. Using our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework, we show that including these primordial fluctuations in the initial conditions can be important, as it produces similar effects on the abundance and anisotropies of the C$\nu$B as the inclusion of large-scale structures beyond the Milky Way halo. Interpretability of data from future C$\nu$B observatories like PTOLEMY therefore depends on correctly modelling these effects.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Duet by Resonating Binary Black Holes with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We leverage gravitational wave observations to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on axion-like particles (ALPs). This study investigates the resonant effects of ALPs with binary black hole systems, where their oscillatory nature induces time-dependent forces on the black holes. By employing a detailed Fisher matrix analysis, we not only probe a new parameter space for ALPs, characterized by their mass and decay constants, but also assess how these parameters affect gravitational waveforms during black hole mergers. Our approach is distinct as it does not assume interactions of ALPs with photons or nucleons. We demonstrate that as binary black holes spiral inward and lose energy, their orbital frequencies may resonate with those of ALPs, producing distinct oscillatory patterns in gravitational waves detectable by upcoming experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). This work broadens the potential of gravitational wave astronomy as a tool for dark matter searches, offering a promising avenue for studying elusive components of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent results from the first year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full five-year observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM for the IDE model with $Q=\beta H_0\rho_{\rm de}$ reaches the $3\sigma$ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with $Q\propto\rho_{\rm c}$, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient $\Gamma$. The IDE model with $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ yields $\beta=0.0003\pm 0.0011$, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of emergent electric field. This is distinguished from the fundamental one in that the emergent electric field directly appears in observations through the Lorentz force, while the latter enters the phase space as the canonical momentum of the electromagnetic field. In Hamiltonian classical electromagnetism this concept naturally appears after introducing the topological $\theta$ term. Furthermore, we show that in the spherically symmetric model the concept of emergent electric field allows us to formulate a modified theory of electromagnetism that is otherwise impossible. The relation between the fundamental and the emergent electric fields is derived from the imposition of general covariance of the electromagnetic strength tensor, which is a nontrivial task in the canonical formulation the modified theory is based on. We couple this theory to emergent modified gravity, where a similar distinction between spacetime and gravity is made such that the spacetime, which defines the observable geometry, is an emergent field composed of the fundamental gravitational field. In this more encompassing emergent field theory coupling gravity and electromagnetism, we show that the spherically symmetric model contains a nonsingular black hole solution where not only modified gravity but also modified electromagnetism is crucial for a robust singularity resolution and to avoid the existence of (super)extermal black holes.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow fluctuation as a possible signature of clustered nuclear geometry in O-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclei having $4n$ number of nucleons are theorized to possess clusters of $\alpha$ particles ($^4$He nucleus). The Oxygen nucleus ($^{16}$O) is a doubly magic nucleus, where the presence of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure grants additional nuclear stability. In this study, we exploit the anisotropic flow coefficients to discern the effects of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear geometry w.r.t. a Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution in O--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV using a hybrid of IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD models. In addition, we use the multi-particle cumulants method to measure anisotropic flow coefficients, such as elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) and triangular flow ($v_{3}$), as a function of collision centrality. Anisotropic flow fluctuations, which are expected to be larger in small collision systems, are also studied for the first time in O--O collisions. It is found that an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear distribution gives rise to an enhanced value of $v_{2}$ and $v_3$ towards the highest multiplicity classes. Consequently, a rise in $v_3/v_2$ is also observed for the (0-10)\% centrality class. Further, for $\alpha$-clustered O--O collisions, fluctuations of $v_{2}$ are larger for the most central collisions, which decrease towards the mid-central collisions. In contrast, for a Woods-Saxon $^{16}$O nucleus, $v_{2}$ fluctuations show an opposite behavior with centrality. This study, when confronted with experimental data may reveal the importance of nuclear density profile on the discussed observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$-gravity allows for the presence of a perfect fluid with a tilted velocity in the Kantowski-Sachs geometry. In this dipole model, we consider an ideal gas and we investigate the evolution of the physical parameters. The tilt parameter is constrained by the nonlinear function $f(Q)$ through the non-diagonal equations of the field equations. We find that the dynamics always reduce to the vacuum solutions of STEGR. This includes the Kasner universe, when no cosmological term is introduced by the $f(Q)$ function, and the isotropic de Sitter universe, where $f\left( Q\right) $ plays the role of the cosmological constant. In the extreme tilt limit, the universe is consistently anisotropic and accelerated. However, the final solution matches that of STEGR.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This could be tested via second-order GW signals in future observatories, for instance, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET. %. for sneutrino mass $m_{\phi} \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $\beta \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dark energy on weighing neutrinos after DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Early-Time Observations of SN 2023wrk: A Luminous Type Ia Supernova with Significant Unburned Carbon in the Outer Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN) 2023wrk at a distance of about 40 Mpc. The earliest detection of this SN can be traced back to a few hours after the explosion. Within the first few days the light curve shows a bump feature, while the B - V color is blue and remains nearly constant. The overall spectral evolution is similar to that of an SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SN Ia, while the C II $\lambda6580$ absorption line appears to be unusually strong in the first spectrum taken at $t \approx -$15.4 days after the maximum light. This carbon feature disappears quickly in subsequent evolution but it reappears at around the time of peak brightness. The complex evolution of the carbon line and the possible detection of Ni III absorption around 4700 {\AA} and 5300 {\AA} in the earliest spectra indicate macroscopic mixing of fuel and ash. The strong carbon lines is likely related to collision of SN ejecta with unbound carbon, consistent with the predictions of pulsational delayed-detonation or carbon-rich circumstellar-matter interaction models. Among those carbon-rich SNe Ia with strong C II $\lambda6580$ absorption at very early times, the line-strength ratio of C II to Si II and the B-V color evolution are found to exhibit large diversity, which may be attributed to different properties of unbound carbon and outward-mixing $^{56}$Ni.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Scattering amplitudes of the reversible $\theta$-exact Seiberg-Witten (SW) map based noncommutative (NC) quantum electrodynamics, and show explicitly the SW map invariance for all tree-level NCQED $2\to2$ proceses, including M\"oller, Bhabha, Compton, pair annihilation, pair production and light-by-light $(\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma)$ scatterings. We apply our NCQED results to the $\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma\gamma\to\ell^+\ell^-$ exclusive processes, convoluted to the ultraperipheral lead $^{208}$Pb ion-ion collisions, recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration at LHC. We demonstrate that $\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$ is the more appropriate channel to probe NC scale $\Lambda_{\rm NC}$ while both are less efficient than some other probes.</description>

Abstract: In the context of TeV-scale lepton number violating (LNV) interactions, we illustrate the interplay between leptogenesis, neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, and LNV searches at proton-proton colliders. Using a concrete model for illustration, we identify the parameter space where standard thermal leptogenesis is rendered unviable due to washout processes and show how $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and $pp$ collisions provide complementary probes. We find that the new particle spectrum can have a decisive impact on the relative sensitivity of these two probes.</description>

      <title>Connecting Cosmic Inflation to Particle Physics with LiteBIRD, CMB-S4, EUCLID and SKA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that next generation Cosmic Microwave Background experiments will be capable of the first ever measurement of the inflaton coupling to other particles, opening a new window to probe the connection between cosmic inflation and particle physics.This sensitivity is based on the impact that the reheating phase after cosmic inflation has on the redshifting of cosmic perturbations. For our analysis we introduce a simple analytic method to estimate the sensitivity of future CMB observations to the reheating temperature and the inflaton coupling. Applying our method to LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 we find that, within a given model of inflation, these missions have the potential to impose both an upper and a lower bound on the inflaton coupling. Further improvement can be achieved if CMB data is combined with optical and 21cm surveys. Our results demonstrate the potential of future observations to constrain microphysical parameters that can provide an important clue to understand how a given model of inflation may be embedded in a more fundamental theory of nature.</description>

      <title>Scalar decay into pions via Higgs portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics a light scalar from a hidden sector can interact with known particles via mixing with the SM Higgs boson. If the scalar mass is of GeV scale, this coupling induces the scalar decay into light hadrons, that saturates the scalar width. Searches for the light scalars are performed in many ongoing experiments and planned for the next generation projects. Applying dispersion relations changes the leading order estimate of the scalar decay rate into pions by a factor of about a hundred indicating the strong final state interaction. This subtlety for about thirty years prevented any reliable inference of the model parameters from experimental data. In this Letter we use the gravitational form factor for neutral pion extracted from analysis of $\gamma^*\gamma\to\pi^0\pi^0$ processes to estimate the quark contribution to scalar decay into two pions. We find a factor of two uncertainty in this estimate and argue that the possible gluon contribution is of the same order. The decay rate to pions smoothly matches that to gluons dominating for heavier scalars. With this finding we refine sensitivities of future projects to the scalar-Higgs mixing. The accuracy in the calculations can be further improved by performing similar analysis of $\gamma^*\gamma\to K K$ and $\gamma^*\gamma\to\eta\eta$ processes and possibly decays like $J/\psi\to\gamma+\pi\pi$.</description>

      <title>Searching for anomalous quartic gauge couplings at muon colliders using principle component analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for new physics~(NP) is one of the areas of high-energy physics that requires the most processing of large amounts of data. At the same time, quantum computing has huge potential advantages when dealing with large amounts of data. The principal component analysis~(PCA) algorithm may be one of the bridges connecting these two aspects. On the one hand, it can be used for anomaly detection, and on the other hand, there are corresponding quantum algorithms for PCA. In this paper, we investigate how to use PCA to search for NP. Taking the example of anomalous quartic gauge couplings in the tri-photon process at muon colliders, we find that PCA can be used to search for NP. Compared with the traditional event selection strategy, the expected constraints on the operator coefficients obtained by PCA based event selection strategy are even better.</description>

      <title>Constraints on holographic QCD phase transitions from PTA observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The underlying physics of QCD phase transition in the early Universe remains largely unknown due to its strong-coupling nature during the quark-gluon plasma/hadron gas transition, yet a holographic model has been proposed to quantitatively fit the lattice QCD data while with its duration of the first-order phase transition (FoPT) left undetermined. At specific baryon chemical potential, the first-order QCD phase transition agrees with the observational constraint of baryon asymmetry. It, therefore, provides a scenario for phase transition gravitational waves (GWs) within the Standard Model of particle physics. If these background GWs could contribute dominantly to the recently claimed common-spectrum red noise from pulsar timing array (PTA) observations, the duration of this FoPT can be well constrained, and the associated primordial black holes are still allowed by current observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the difficulties one has to face in the future phenomenological studies of the new physics~(NP), is the need to deal with increasing amounts of data. It is therefore increasingly important to improve the efficiency in the phenomenological study of the NP. Whether it is the use of the Standard Model effective field theory~(SMEFT), the use of machine learning~(ML) algorithms, or the use of quantum computing, all are means of improving the efficiency. In this paper, we use a ML algorithm, the auto-encoder~(AE), to study the dimension-8 operators in the SMEFT which contribute to the gluon quartic gauge couplings~(gQGCs) at muon colliders. The AE is one of the ML algorithms that has the potential to be accelerated by the quantum computing. It is found that the AE-based anomaly detection algorithm can be used as event selection strategy to study the gQGCs at the muon colliders, and is effective compared with traditional event selection strategies.</description>

Abstract: We propose to detect signals from quark orbital angular momentum (OAM) through exclusive $\pi^0$ production in electron-(longitudinally-polarized) proton collisions. Our analysis demonstrates that the $\sin 2\phi$ azimuthal angular correlation between the transverse momentum of the scattered electron and the recoil proton serves as a sensitive probe of quark OAM. Additionally, we present a numerical estimate of the asymmetry associated with this correlation for the kinematics accessible at EIC and EicC. This study aims to pave the way for the first experimental study of quark OAM in relation to the Jaffe-Manohar spin sum rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12114v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation accompanied by CP-violation in the presence of magnetic fields. The $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation, which violates the baryon number ($\mathcal{B}$) by two units ($|\Delta \mathcal{B}| = 2$), can be originated from the mixing between the neutron ($n$) and the neutral elementary particle ($\eta$) and may give rise to non-trivial effects that are different from previous theoretical predictions. We show that the probability of the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation can be greatly enhanced by adjusting the magnetic field properly. In particular, the peak values of the oscillation probability in the presence of resonance magnetic fields can be $8$-$10$ orders of magnitude higher than that in the absence of magnetic fields. We point out that there might not be sizable CP-violating effects in the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation unless the mass of $\eta$ is close to the mass of the neutron. We also analyze the interplay between various parameters associated with both $\mathcal{B}$-violation and CP-violation and attempt to disentangle the effects of such parameters. The $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation process accompanied by CP-violation may open a promising avenue for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of generating dark matter (DM) purely from ultra-light primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation with the latter being produced from a first order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe. If such ultra-light PBH leads to an early matter domination, it can give rise to a doubly peaked gravitational wave (GW) spectrum in Hz-kHz ballpark with the low frequency peak generated from PBH density fluctuations being within near future experimental sensitivity. In the sub-dominant PBH regime, the FOPT generated GW spectrum comes within sensitivity due to absence of entropy dilution. In both the regimes, PBH mass from a few kg can be probed by GW experiments like BBO, ET, CE, UDECIGO etc. while DM mass gets restricted to the superheavy ballpark in the PBH dominance case. Apart from distinct DM mass ranges in the two scenarios, GW observations can differentiate by measuring their distinct spectral shapes.</description>

      <title>Dispelling the $\sqrt{L}$ myth for the High-Luminosity LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extrapolations of sensitivity to new interactions and standard model parameters critically inform the programme at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and potential future collider cases. To this end, statistical considerations based on inclusive quantities and established analysis strategies typically give rise to a sensitivity scaling with the square root of the luminosity, $\sqrt{L}$. This suggests only a mild sensitivity improvement for LHC's high-luminosity phase, compared to the collected data up to the year 2025. We discuss representative analyses in top quark, Higgs boson and electroweak gauge boson phenomenology and provide clear evidence that the assumption that the sensitivity in searches and measurement scales only with $\sqrt{L}$ at the High-Luminosity LHC is overly conservative at best, and unrealistic in practice. As kinematic coverage enables more targeted search strategies with sufficient statistical sensitivity, employing a multitude of features in data dispels the scaling based on more inclusive selections.</description>

      <title>Photon-Odderon interference in exclusive $\chi_{c}$ charmonium production at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exclusive $C=+1$ scalar, axial-vector, and tensor quarkonium production in high-energy electron-proton scattering requires a $C$-odd $t$-channel exchange of a photon or a three gluon ladder. We derive the expressions for the corresponding amplitudes. The relative phase of the photon vs. three gluon exchange amplitudes is determined by the sign of the light-front matrix element of the eikonal color current operator $d^{abc}J^{+a}J^{+b}J^{+c}$ at moderate $x$, and is not affected by small-$x$ QCD evolution. Model calculations predict constructive interference, which is particularly strong for momentum transfer $|t|\sim 1$~GeV$^2$ where the cross section for $\chi_{cJ}$ production exceeds that for pure photon exchange by up to a factor of 4. We find that exclusive $\chi_{cJ}$ electroproduction at the Electron-Ion Collider should occur with well measurable rates and measurements of these processes should allow to find an evidence of the perturbative Odderon exchange. We also compute the total electroproduction cross section as a function of energy and provide first estimates of the number of $\chi_{cJ}$ events per month at the Electron-Ion Collider design luminosity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid analysis of radiative corrections to neutron decay with current algebra and effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Meson mass and width: Deep learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is fascinating to predict the mass and width of the ordinary and exotic mesons solely based on their quark content and quantum numbers. Such prediction goes beyond conventional methodologies traditionally employed in hadron physics for calculating or estimating these quantities. The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known. Our predictions obtained through the DNNs, will be useful for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Parameters of the tensor tetraquark $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass and width of the tensor tetraquark $T=bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ with spin-parity $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{+}$ are calculated in the context of the QCD sum rule method. The tetraquark $T$ is modeled as a diquark-antidiquark state built of components $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }b$ and $\overline{c}\gamma _{\nu }C\overline{c}^{T}$ with $C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m=(12.795\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$ of the exotic tensor meson $T$ is found by means of the two-point sum rule approach. Its full width $\Gamma$ is evaluated by considering processes $T \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}$, $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{\ast -}$. Partial widths of these decays are computed by means of the three-point sum rule approach which is used to determine the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Predictions obtained for the width $\Gamma _{\mathrm{T}}=55.5_{-9.9}^{+10.6}~\mathrm{MeV}$, as well as the mass of the tetraquark $T $ can be useful in investigations of fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>

Abstract: We point out that the observed pattern of lepton flavor mixing can be well described by a proper nearest-neighbor expansion of a constant $3\times 3$ unitary matrix in powers of a small parameter characterizing the fine effect of $\mu$-$\tau$ permutation symmetry breaking. We take an example of this kind for illustration, and provide complete discussions on the usefulness in the study of leptonic CP violation and unitarity triangles in matter.</description>

      <title>The Potential Energy of Heavy Quarkonium in Flavor-Dependent Systems from a Holographic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, which incorporates information on the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility from lattice results, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the potential energy, running coupling, and dissociation time for heavy quark-antiquark pairs using gauge/gravity duality. This study encompasses various systems, including pure gluon systems, 2 flavor systems, 2+1 flavor systems, and 2+1+1 flavor systems under finite temperature and chemical potential. The results reveal that the linear component of the potential energy diminishes as the flavor increases. It is also found that our results are extremely close to the recent lattice results for 2+1 flavors at finite temperature. Moreover, we have thoroughly investigated the dissociation distance and running coupling constant of quark-antiquark pairs to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior across various flavors. Finally, we have examined real-time dynamics of quark dissociation. The findings indicate that the dissociation time of quark-antiquark pairs is dependent on temperature, chemical potential, and flavor of the systems.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor in $\Phi^4$ theory at one loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor form factors are studied in $\Phi^4$ theory to one-loop order with particular focus on the $D$-term, a particle property which has attracted a lot of attention in the recent literature. It is shown that the free Klein-Gordon theory value of the $D$-term $D_{\text{free}}=-1$ is reduced to $D_{\text{one-loop}} =-\frac13$ even if the $\Phi^4$ interaction is infinitesimally small. A companion work in $\Phi^3$ theory confirms this result which may indicate that it is independent of the type of interaction as long as the scalar theory is renormalizable. Dispersion relations are studied. Various definitions of mean square radii including the mechanical radius are investigated. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the EMT properties of particles and their interpretation.</description>

      <title>A systematic investigation on dark matter-electron scattering in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the general dark matter-electron interactions within the framework of effective field theories (EFT). We consider both the non-relativistic (NR) EFT and the relativistic EFT descriptions of the interactions with the spin of dark matter (DM) up to one, i.e., the scalar ($\phi$), fermion ($\chi$), and vector $(X)$ DM scenarios. We first collect the leading-order NR EFT operators describing the DM-electron interactions, and construct especially the NR operators for the vector DM case. Next, we consider all possible leading-order relativistic EFT operators including those with a photon field and perform the NR reduction to match them onto the NR EFT. Then we rederive the DM-bound-electron scattering rate within the NR EFT framework and find that the matrix element squared, which is the key input that encodes the DM and atomic information, can be compactly decomposed into three terms. Each term is a product of a DM response function $(a_{0,1,2})$, which is essentially a factor of Wilson coefficients squared, and its corresponding generalized atomic response function ($\widetilde W_{0,1,2}$). Lastly, we employ the electron recoil data from the DM direct detection experiments (including XENON10, XENON1T, and PandaX-4T) to constrain all the non-relativistic and relativistic operators in all three DM scenarios. We set strong bounds on the DM-electron interactions in the sub-GeV region. Particularly, we find that the latest PandaX-4T S2-only data provide stringent constraints on dark matter with a mass greater than approximately 20 MeV, surpassing those from the previous XENON10 and XENON1T experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal Anomaly Detection at the LHC: Transforming Optimal Classifiers and the DDD Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to transform supervised classifiers into effective unsupervised anomaly detectors. The method we have developed, termed Discriminatory Detection of Distortions (DDD), enhances anomaly detection by training a discriminator model on both original and artificially modified datasets. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our models on the Dark Machines Anomaly Score Challenge channels and a search for 4-top quark events, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach across various final states and beyond the Standard Model scenarios.
  We compare the performance of the DDD method with the Deep Robust One-Class Classification method (DROCC), which incorporates signals in the training process, and the Deep Support Vector Data Description (DeepSVDD) method, a well established and well performing method for anomaly detection. Results show that the effectiveness of each model varies by signal and channel, with DDD proving to be a very effective anomaly detector. We recommend the combined use of DeepSVDD and DDD for purely unsupervised applications, with the addition of flow models for improved performance when resources allow.
  Findings suggest that network architectures that excel in supervised contexts, such as the particle transformer with standard model interactions, also perform well as unsupervised anomaly detectors. We also show that with these methods, it is likely possible to recognize 4-top quark production as an anomaly without prior knowledge of the process. We argue that the Large Hadron Collider community can transform supervised classifiers into anomaly detectors to uncover potential new physical phenomena in each search.</description>

Abstract: Energy levels of hydrogen are calculated as one-loop matrix elements of the QED energy-momentum tensor trace in the external field approximation. An explicit connection established between the one-loop trace diagrams and the standard Lamb shift one-loop diagrams. Our calculations provide an argument against inclusion of the anomalous trace contribution in the decomposition of the QED quantum field Hamiltonian and serve as an illustration how the trace anomaly is realized in the bound state QED.</description>

Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive investigation on the radiative decays of $P$-wave bottom baryons using the light-cone sum rule method. We analyze their electromagnetic transitions into ground-state bottom baryons together with a photon. Together with their mass spectra and strong decays investigated in Refs. \cite{Yang:2020zrh,Tan:2023opd}, a rather complete QCD sum rule study has been done to understand the $P$-wave singly bottom baryons within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. As summarized in Tables~\ref{tab:candidate}/\ref{tab:candidate6f}, some $P$-wave bottom baryons have limited strong decay widths so that their radiative decay widths become non-negligible. We propose to study these excited bottom baryons and their radiative decays in the future Belle-II, BESIII, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous orbits of trans-Neptunian objects can be accounted for by the planet 9 hypothesis. One intriguing possibility is that planet 9 could be a dilute axion star captured by the solar system, with the ratio of the axion star to dark matter being approximately 1/10. Although dilute axion stars can emit monochromatic signals through two-photon decay, the spontaneous decay signal is too weak to be detected by radio telescopes. However, we find that stimulated decay of the dilute axion star, which explains planet 9, can occur by directing a radio beam with a power of 50MW into the star. The resulting echo can be detected by terrestrial telescopes such as SKA, FAST, ngLOBO, and LOFAR. Therefore, the dilute axion star can be distinguished from other planet 9 candidates, such as a primordial black hole or a free-floating planet captured by the solar system.</description>

Abstract: The decay $\eta\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ is an ideal process in which to study flavor-conserving $C$ and $CP$ violation beyond the Standard Model. We deduce the $C$- and $CP$-odd quark operators that contribute to $\eta\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ originating from the mass-dimension 6 Standard Model effective field theory. The corresponding hadron-level operators that generate a non-vanishing $I=0$ amplitude at order $p^6$ in the chiral effective theory are presented for the first time, in addition to the leading order operatorsascribed to the $I=2$ final state. By fitting the KLOE-2 and the most recent BESIII experimental data, we determine the coefficients of the lowest order $I=0$ and $I=2$ amplitudes and estimate the potential new physics energy scale. We also perform an impact study of the future $\eta\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-universal probes of composite Higgs models: New bounds and prospects for FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the leading loop-level phenomenology of composite Higgs models via the effective field theory of a strongly interacting light Higgs and top quark (SILH+TQ). We systematically analyze the renormalization group evolution (RGE) of tree-generated operators in the SILH+TQ scenario, finding large mixings of flavor non-universal operators into those affecting electroweak precision observables. We show that these model-independent RG contributions are more important than typical estimates for finite parts. Flavor non-universal effects are completely captured by examining three options for the top mixing: fully composite $q_L^3$, equal compositeness, and fully composite $t_R$. In the most phenomenologically viable case of a fully composite $t_R$, we show that the strongest bound on the natural parameter space comes from next-to-leading log running of the 4-top operator $O_{tt} = (\bar t_R \gamma_\mu t_R)(\bar t_R \gamma^\mu t_R)$ into the Peskin-Takeuchi $T$ parameter. In general, we find that this 2-loop effect allows existing electroweak precision data to give a better constraint on 4-top operators compared to high-energy probes from top production at the LHC. Independent of the top mixing, we find that a future tera-$Z$ machine such as FCC-ee has the potential to probe composite Higgs models up to a scale of $m_* \gtrsim 25$ TeV, and test the naturalness of the electroweak scale at the $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ level.</description>

      <title>A Markov Chain Monte Carlo determination of Proton PDF uncertainties at NNLO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current scientific standard in PDF uncertainty estimation relies either on repeated fits over artificially generated data to arrive at Monte Carlo samples of best fits or on the Hessian method, which uses a quadratic expansion of the figure of merit, the $\chi^2$-function. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods allows one to access the uncertainties of PDFs without making use of quadratic approximations in a statistically sound procedure while at the same time preserving the correspondence between the sample and $\chi^2$-value. Rooted in Bayesian statistics the $\chi^2$-function is repeatedly sampled to obtain a set of PDFs that serves as a representation of the statistical distribution of the PDFs in their function space. After removing the dependence between the samples (the so-called autocorrelation) the set can be used to propagate the uncertainties to physical observables. The final result is an independent procedure to obtain PDF uncertainties that can be confronted by the state-of-the-art in order to ultimately arrive at a better understanding of the proton's structure.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray flux limits from brown dwarfs: Implications for dark matter annihilating into long-lived mediators</title>

Abstract: Brown dwarfs (BDs) are celestial objects representing the link between the least massive main-sequence stars and giant gas planets. In the first part of this article, we perform a model-independent search of a gamma-ray signal from the direction of nine nearby BDs in 13 years of \Fermi-LAT data. We find no significant excess of gamma rays, and we, therefore, set 95\% confidence level upper limits on the gamma-ray flux with a binned-likelihood approach. In the second part of the paper, we interpret these bounds within an exotic mechanism proposed for gamma-ray production in BDs: If the dark matter (DM) of the universe is constituted of particles with non-negligible couplings to the standard model, BDs may efficiently accumulate them through scatterings. DM particles eventually thermalise, and can annihilate into light, long-lived, mediators which later decay into photons outside the BD. Within this framework, the current Fermi-LAT stacked upper limits on the gamma-ray flux of the selected BDs do not enable setting a bound on the DM-nucleon cross-section. An improvement of approximately a factor of 9 in the gamma-ray limits is required to obtain bounds on the scattering cross-section $\sigma_{\chi n}$ $\sim 10^{-36}$ cm$^{2}$ for DM masses below 10 GeV. This improvement would cover a larger portion of the parameter space in mediator decay length and DM mass.

      <title>Limits on Neutrino Emission from GRB 221009A from MeV to PeV using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05459</link>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been considered a possible source of high-energy neutrinos. While no correlations have yet been detected between high-energy neutrinos and GRBs, the recent observation of GRB 221009A - the brightest GRB observed by Fermi-GBM to date and the first one to be observed above an energy of 10 TeV - provides a unique opportunity to test for hadronic emission. In this paper, we leverage the wide energy range of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for neutrinos from GRB 221009A. We find no significant deviation from background expectation across event samples ranging from MeV to PeV energies, placing stringent upper limits on the neutrino emission from this source.</description>

      <title>Elements of Confinement for QCD with Twelve Massless Quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider continuum formulation QCD in four dimensions with twelve massless fundamental quark flavors. Splitting the SU(N) gauge field into background and fluctuation parts, we use well developed techniques to calculate the one-loop effective action for the theory. We find that for constant self-dual background field-strength tensor the notorious infrared divergences of the effective action cancel between gauge and matter sectors if the number of massless quark flavors is exactly $N_f = 4N$. The ultraviolet divergencies of the effective action are non-perturbatively renormalized with a $\beta$-function that matches the known perturbative result in the weak coupling limit. The resulting UV- and IR-finite effective action possesses a non-trivial minimum which has lower free energy than the perturbative vacuum, and for which the expectation value of the Polyakov loop vanishes. Inclusion of finite temperature effects points to the presence of a first-order phase transition to the perturbative vacuum with a calculable critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Induced Gravitational Waves from a Smooth Crossover beyond Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial fluctuations can be affected by the modification of the sound speed $c^2_{\rm s}$ and the equation of state parameter $w$ once the curvature fluctuations reenter the cosmological horizon. That softening can also significantly boost the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) at the mass scale where the softening arises. In this work, we consider a hypothetical softening of $w$ and $c^2_{\rm s}$ caused by a smooth crossover beyond Standard Model theories, for what we numerically compute the secondary induced GW considering the case of a flat scale-invariant power spectrum. We find that if the amplitude of the power spectrum is sufficiently large, the characteristic feature of the GW signal caused by the smooth crossover can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave interferometers and differentiated from the pure radiation case. At the same time, depending on the mass scale where the crossover occurs, such a scenario can have compatibility with PBHs being all the dark matter when $\mathcal{A} \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, with a mass function very sharply peaked around the horizon mass scale of the minimum of the sound speed. Our results show that the GW signal can be used to resolve the existing degeneracy of sharply peaked mass function caused by peaked power spectrums and broad ones in the presence of softenings of $w$ and $c^2_{\rm s}$.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM Tensions: Localising Missing Physics through Consistency Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM tensions are by definition model dependent; one sees anomalies through the prism of $\Lambda$CDM. Thus, progress towards tension resolution necessitates checking the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model to localise missing physics either in redshift or scale. Since the Universe is dynamical and redshift is a proxy for time, it is imperative to first perform consistency checks involving redshift, then consistency checks involving scale, as the next steps to settle the ``systematics versus new physics" debate and foster informed model building. We present a review of the hierarchy of assumptions underlying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and comment on whether relaxing them can address the tensions. We focus on the lowest lying fruit of identifying missing physics through the identification of redshift dependent $\Lambda$CDM model fitting parameters. We highlight recent progress made on ${S_8:= \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$ tension and elucidate how similar progress can be made on $H_0$ tension. Our discussions indicate that $H_0$ tension, equivalently a redshift dependent $H_0$, and a redshift dependent $S_8$ imply a problem with background $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>How open is the asteroid-mass primordial black hole window?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can make up all of the dark matter (DM) if their mass, $m$, is in the so-called 'asteroid-mass window', $10^{17} \, {\rm g} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{22} \, {\rm g}$. Observational constraints on the abundance of PBHs are usually calculated assuming they all have the same mass, however this is unlikely to be a good approximation. PBHs formed from the collapse of large density perturbations during radiation domination are expected to have an extended mass function (MF), due to the effects of critical collapse. The PBH MF is often assumed to be lognormal, however it has recently been shown that other functions are a better fit to numerically calculated MFs. We recalculate both current and potential future constraints for these improved fitting functions. We find that for current constraints the asteroid-mass window narrows, but remains open (i.e. all of the DM can be in the form of PBHs) unless the PBH MF is wider than expected. Future evaporation and microlensing constraints may together exclude all of the DM being in PBHs, depending on the width of the PBH MF and also the shape of its low and high mass tails.</description>

      <title>Simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics in the vicinity of a critical endpoint belonging to the universality class of the Ising model. This study is motivated by the challenge of modeling the dynamics of critical fluctuations near a conjectured critical endpoint in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We focus on the interaction of shear modes with a conserved scalar density, which is known as model H. We show that the observed dynamical scaling behavior depends on the correlation length and the shear viscosity of the fluid. As the correlation length is increased or the viscosity is decreased we observe a cross-over from the dynamical exponent of critical diffusion, $z\simeq 4$, to the expected scaling exponent of model H, $z\simeq 3$. We use our method to investigate time-dependent correlation function of non-Gaussian moments $M^n(t)$ of the order parameter. We find that the relaxation time depends in non-trivial manner on the power $n$.</description>

Abstract: It is believed that the core of a neutron star can be host to various novel phases of matter, from nucleon superfluid phase to exotic high baryon density quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phases. Different observational signals for such phase transitions have been discussed in the literature. Here, we point out a unique phenomenon associated with phase transition to a superfluid phase, which may be the nucleon superfluid phase or a phase like the CFL phase, allowing for superfluid vortices. In any superfluid phase transition, a random network of vortices forms via the so-called Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which eventually mostly decays away, finally leaving primarily vortices arising from the initial angular momentum of the core. This transient, random vortex network can have a non-zero net angular momentum for the superfluid component, which will generally be oriented in an arbitrary direction. This is in contrast to the final vortices, which arise from initial rotation and hence have the initial angular momentum of the neutron star. The angular momentum of the random vortex network is balanced by an equal and opposite angular momentum in the normal fluid due to the conservation of angular momentum, thereby imparting an arbitrarily oriented angular momentum component to the outer shell of the neutron star. This will affect the pulse timing and pulse profile of a pulsar. These changes in the pulses will decay away in a characteristic manner such that the random vortex network decays, obeying specific scaling laws leading to universal features for the detection of superfluid transitions occurring in a pulsar core.</description>

      <title>Stringy constraints on primordial electromagnetic fields in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study primordial electromagnetic fields in effective actions of string theory. In contrast to a conventional scenario of producing primordial electromagnetic fields induced by the axion inflation, we deal with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action as a non-linear generation of Maxwell theory. It turns out that the intensity of generated electromagnetic fields is bounded from above by the string scale which can also be rewritten in terms of supersymmetry breaking scale in the context of type IIB Large Volume Scenario. The instability parameter $\xi$ is constrained by the tadpole cancellation condition of D3-branes and a realization of hierarchy between the string scale and the Hubble scale of inflation. Hence, the magnetogenesis can be realized in the limited corner of the string landscape due to the ${\cal O}(1)$ value of the coefficient of Chern-Simons coupling.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear treatment of a black hole mimicker ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first nonlinear and self-consistent study of the merger and ringdown of a black hole mimicking object with stable light rings. To that end, we numerically solve the full Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations governing the head-on collisions of a series of binary boson stars in the large-mass-ratio regime resulting in spinning horizonless remnants with stable light rings. We broadly confirm the appearance of features in the extracted gravitational waveforms expected based on perturbative methods: the signal from the prompt response of the remnants approaches that of a Kerr black hole in the large-compactness limit, and the subsequent emissions contain periodically appearing bursts akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes. However, these bursts occur at high frequencies and are sourced by perturbations of the remnant's internal degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the emitted waveforms also contain a large-amplitude and long-lived component comparable in frequency to black hole quasi-normal modes. We further characterize the emissions, obtain basic scaling relations of relevant timescales, and compute the energy emitted in gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The History of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We overview the history of primordial black hole (PBH) research from the first papers around 50 years ago to the present epoch. The history may be divided into four periods, the dividing lines being marked by three key developments: inflation on the theoretical front and the detection of microlensing events by the MACHO project and gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA project on the observation front. However, they are also characterised by somewhat different focuses of research. The period 1967-1980 covered the groundbreaking work on PBH formation and evaporation. The period 1980-1996 mainly focussed on their formation, while the period 1996-2016 consolidated the work on formation but also collated the constraints on the PBH abundance. In the period 2016-2024 there was a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs and - while opinions about the strength of the purported evidence vary - this has motivated more careful studies of some aspects of the subject. Certainly the soaring number of papers on PBHs in this last period indicates a growing interest in the topic.</description>

      <title>Volume effect on the extraction of sound velocity in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of the speed of sound in quark-gluon plasma is a crucial aspect of understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial-state fluctuations on the extraction of the speed of sound in a quark-gluon plasma in the ultra-central collisions. By employing the TRENTo model for simulating initial conditions, we demonstrate that these fluctuations lead to sizable volume effect, which in turn corrects the measured values of the sound velocity. With respect to realistic conditions of high-energy heavy-ion experiments, we provide quantitative estimate of these corrections.</description>
