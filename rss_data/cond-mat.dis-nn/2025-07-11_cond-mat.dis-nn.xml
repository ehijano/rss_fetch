      <title>Large-scale portfolio optimization with variational neural annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis applied to the S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm on portfolio optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Localization and top eigenvalue detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the top eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector in ensembles of random matrices has significant applications across various fields. An existing method, based on the linear stability of a complementary set of cavity equations, has been successful in identifying the top eigenvalue when the associated eigenvector is extended. However, this approach fails when the eigenvector is localized. In this work, we adapt the real-valued cavity method to address this limitation by introducing a novel criterion that exploits the constraints of the cavity equations to detect the top eigenvalue in systems with a localized top eigenvector. Our results are validated using the Anderson model as a paradigmatic example.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approximate Optimization: A New Variational Monte Carlo Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.</description>

      <title>Universal Spin Models are Universal Approximators in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the theoretical pillars that sustain certain machine learning models are universal approximation theorems, which prove that they can approximate all functions from a function class to arbitrary precision. Independently, classical spin models are termed universal if they can reproduce the behavior of any other spin model in their low energy sector. Universal spin models have been characterized via sufficient and necessary conditions, showing that simple models such as the 2d Ising with fields are universal. In this work, we prove that universal spin models are universal approximators of probability distributions. As a consequence, the characterization of the former gives rise to universal approximation theorems for the latter. This allows us to derive new proofs of universal approximation theorems for restricted and deep Boltzmann machines, as well as deep belief networks. This work illustrates that independently discovered universality statements may be intimately related, enabling the transfer of results.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient p-Circuits for Generative Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A p-circuit comprising a network of $N$ p-bits can generate samples from a probability distribution with $2^N$ possibilities just like a network of q-bits, though there are interesting fundamental differences. A p-bit is essentially a binary stochastic neuron used in Boltzmann machines which involve the repeated application of a specific elementary operation, whereby each p-bit looks at the state of 'n' other p-bits, computes the probability for being $0$ or $1$, and chooses its next state accordingly. We argue that the energy cost, $\epsilon(n)$, of this elementary operation is an important metric and we use our ASIC to extract it for our implementation, to serve as model and benchmark for other implementations. We further argue that the same elementary operation can be used in generative AI replacing the standard continuous or multi-bit digital neurons with p-bits. It might appear that this would introduce significant errors, but we show that by averaging a small number (say $1 \ to \ 100$) samples, the image quality can be restored.</description>

      <title>Temporal and spatial separations between spin glass and short-range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broken-symmetry-induced order parameters account for many phenomena in condensed matter physics. For spin glasses, such a framework dictates its theoretical construction, whereas experiments have only established dynamical behaviors such as frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility and aging but not the thermodynamic phase. Experimental techniques have limitations when the spin glass is probed as an isolated state. To resolve this conundrum, we create an evolution from long-range order using a well-controlled tuning of the disorder on a spinel's sublattice. Cross-referencing a series of specimens at both long (milliseconds to seconds) and short (picosecond) time scales illustrates the relationship between spin glass and long- and short-range orders. The dynamics of short- and long-range order formations are not affected by disorder, as revealed by neutron magnetic diffuse scattering, however the ranges of these orderings are changed by the introduced disorder. Across all specimens, the inflection point of the correlation length's temperature dependence fully matches with the peak in heat capacity, while spin glass can freeze either below or well above this characteristic temperature of spin order formation. Our results identify an uncorrelated coexistence of the two and attribute components of the spin glass to individual spins at domain walls between spin clusters.</description>

      <title>A statistical physics framework for optimal learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting. Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Deterministic simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate simplicial complexes deterministically growing from a single vertex. In the first step, a vertex and an edge connecting it to the primordial vertex are added. The resulting simplicial complex has a 1-dimensional simplex and two 0-dimensional faces (the vertices). The process continues recursively: On the $n$-th step, every existing $d-$dimensional simplex ($d\leq n-1$) joins a new vertex forming a $(d+1)-$dimensional simplex; all $2^{d+1}-2$ new faces are also added so that the resulting object remains a simplicial complex. The emerging simplicial complex has intriguing local and global characteristics. The number of simplices grows faster than $n!$, and the upper-degree distributions follow a power law. Here, the upper degree (or $d$-degree) of a $d$-simplex refers to the number of $(d{+}1)$-simplices that share it as a face. Interestingly, the $d$-degree distributions evolve quite differently for different values of $d$. We compute the Hodge Laplacian spectra of simplicial complexes and show that the spectral and Hausdorff dimensions are infinite. We also explore a constrained version where the dimension of the added simplices is fixed to a finite value $m$. In the constrained model, the number of simplices grows exponentially. In particular, for $m=1$, the spectral dimension is $2$. For $m=2$, the spectral dimension is finite, and the degree distribution follows a power law, while the $1$-degree distribution decays exponentially.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Framework for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Optical Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) enable information processing beyond classical limits by exploiting the advantages of classical and quantum optics. However, simulation of large-scale bosonic lattices remains a significant challenge due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space required to describe a quantum network accurately. Consequently, previous theoretical studies have been limited to small-scale systems, leaving the behaviour of multimode QONNs largely unexplored. This work presents an efficient computational framework based on the phase-space positive-P method for simulating bosonic neuromorphic systems. This approach provides a view to previously inaccessible regimes, allowing the validation of large-scale bosonic networks in various quantum machine learning tasks such as quantum state classification and quantum state feature prediction. Our results show that the performance of a large quantum reservoir does not improve monotonously with the number of bosonic modes, instead following a complex dependence driven by the interplay of nonlinearity, reservoir size, and the average occupation of the input mode. These findings are essential for designing and optimising optical bosonic reservoirs for future quantum neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

      <title>Astrocyte-Mediated Higher-Order Control of Synaptic Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of higher-order topological signals are increasingly recognized as a key aspect of the activity of complex systems. A paradigmatic example are synaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different mechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms, the role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the so-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the competition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have yet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the tripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in short-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and pre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability of neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term plasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a minimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation that propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit is highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to external input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different synapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation robustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that supports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism by which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information processing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest recurrent circuits.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs or medium range crystalline order (MRCO). In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale $L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$ exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>

      <title>Shaping Magnetic Order by Local Frustration for Itinerant Fermions on a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic magnetism is an iconic and rare example of collective quantum order that emerges from the interference of paths taken by a hole in a sea of strongly interacting fermions. Here the lattice topology plays a fundamental role, with odd loops frustrating ferromagnetism, as seen in recent experiments. However, the resulting magnetic order on a general graph has remained elusive. Here we systematically establish, using exact diagonalization, that local frustration centers on a grid strongly bind singlets while sharing a delocalized hole. This collective effect generalizes to random graphs, producing sharp and predictable variation with tunable frustration measures. Our findings demonstrate that one can shape the spin order as well as tune the net magnetization by embedding geometric frustration, opening up new avenues for spatially resolved quantum control of many-body systems. We outline a protocol to realize some of the key findings in existing cold-atom setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) introduce well-known lattice artifacts. We present a novel Pseudoperiodic Spherical Boundary Condition (SBC) that is perfectly isotropic. Through detailed comparative simulations, we demonstrate that SBC eliminates the structural and dynamic anisotropy inherent to PBC. For the crowded systems where these artifacts are most prominent, our method is also computationally more efficient than standard Minimum Image Convention implementations. This establishes SBC as a powerful, high-fidelity alternative for simulating isotropic matter.</description>

      <title>A c-theorem for the effective central charge in the R=1 replica limit, and applications to systems with measurement-induced randomness</title>

Abstract: We present a general theorem demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}=(d c/dR)|_{R=1}$ under renormalization group (RG) flow in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit of a $R$-copy $2D$ conformal field theory (CFT) action $S_{*}$ perturbed by a replica interaction of the form $$-\mathbb{S}=-\sum_{a=1}^{R}S_{*}^{(a)}+\Delta\int d^2 x \sum_{\substack{a,b=1\\ a\neq b}}^{R}\varphi^{(a)}(x)\varphi^{(b)}(x).$$ Here $\varphi$ is a scaling field belonging to the CFT with action $S_*$ and the coupling $\Delta$ is relevant in the RG sense. We show that the infrared value of $c_{\text{eff}}$ is always $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unperturbed CFT $S_{*}$. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem". As an application of this theorem, we consider replica field theories in the limit of $R \to 1$ replicas of the form above, shown by Nahum and Jacobsen [arXiv:2504.01264] to describe $2D$ classical monitored systems, where measurements introduce a form of quenched randomness via Bayes' theorem. Lastly, we discuss a possible relationship of our theorem with the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}=(dc/dR)|_{R=0}$ for the above replica action in the different $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit, which is of relevance to systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, as opposed to measurements.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics analysis of graph neural networks: Approaching optimality in the contextual stochastic block model</title>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with graphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Learning to control non-equilibrium dynamics using local imperfect gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that "imperfect" feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>On Marginal Stability in Low Temperature Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show marginal stability of near-ground states in spherical spin glasses is equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking at zero temperature near overlap $1$. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, and obtain geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for vector spin glass models. For generic models, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling study for the estimation of dynamical exponent $z$ of three-dimensional XY spin glass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>
