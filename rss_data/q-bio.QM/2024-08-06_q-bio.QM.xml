      <title>Efficient Approximate Methods for Design of Experiments for Copolymer Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a set of algorithms to solve a broad class of Design of Experiment (DoE) problems efficiently. Specifically, we consider problems in which one must choose a subset of polymers to test in experiments such that the learning of the polymeric design rules is optimal. This subset must be selected from a larger set of polymers permissible under arbitrary experimental design constraints. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms by solving several pragmatic nucleic acid therapeutics engineering scenarios, where limitations in synthesis of chemically diverse nucleic acids or feasibility of measurements in experimental setups appear as constraints. Our approach focuses on identifying optimal experimental designs from a given set of experiments, which is in contrast to traditional, generative DoE methods like BIBD. Finally, we discuss how these algorithms are broadly applicable to well-established optimal DoE criteria like D-optimality.</description>

      <title>A four-step Bayesian workflow for improving ecological science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing anthropogenic pressures have increased the need for robust predictive models. Meeting this demand requires approaches that can handle bigger data to yield forecasts that capture the variability and underlying uncertainty of ecological systems. Bayesian models are especially adept at this and are growing in use in ecology. Yet many ecologists today are not trained to take advantage of the bigger ecological data needed to generate more flexible robust models. Here we describe a broadly generalizable workflow for statistical analyses and show how it can enhance training in ecology. Building on the increasingly computational toolkit of many ecologists, this approach leverages simulation to integrate model building and testing for empirical data more fully with ecological theory. In turn this workflow can fit models that are more robust and well-suited to provide new ecological insights -- allowing us to refine where to put resources for better estimates, better models, and better forecasts.</description>

      <title>MALADE: Orchestration of LLM-powered Agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation for Pharmacovigilance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), given their remarkable text understanding and generation abilities, there is an unprecedented opportunity to develop new, LLM-based methods for trustworthy medical knowledge synthesis, extraction and summarization. This paper focuses on the problem of Pharmacovigilance (PhV), where the significance and challenges lie in identifying Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from diverse text sources, such as medical literature, clinical notes, and drug labels. Unfortunately, this task is hindered by factors including variations in the terminologies of drugs and outcomes, and ADE descriptions often being buried in large amounts of narrative text. We present MALADE, the first effective collaborative multi-agent system powered by LLM with Retrieval Augmented Generation for ADE extraction from drug label data. This technique involves augmenting a query to an LLM with relevant information extracted from text resources, and instructing the LLM to compose a response consistent with the augmented data. MALADE is a general LLM-agnostic architecture, and its unique capabilities are: (1) leveraging a variety of external sources, such as medical literature, drug labels, and FDA tools (e.g., OpenFDA drug information API), (2) extracting drug-outcome association in a structured format along with the strength of the association, and (3) providing explanations for established associations. Instantiated with GPT-4 Turbo or GPT-4o, and FDA drug label data, MALADE demonstrates its efficacy with an Area Under ROC Curve of 0.90 against the OMOP Ground Truth table of ADEs. Our implementation leverages the Langroid multi-agent LLM framework and can be found at https://github.com/jihyechoi77/malade.</description>

      <title>Tensorial template matching for fast cross-correlation with rotations and its application for tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection is a main task in computer vision. Template matching is the reference method for detecting objects with arbitrary templates. However, template matching computational complexity depends on the rotation accuracy, being a limiting factor for large 3D images (tomograms). Here, we implement a new algorithm called tensorial template matching, based on a mathematical framework that represents all rotations of a template with a tensor field. Contrary to standard template matching, the computational complexity of the presented algorithm is independent of the rotation accuracy. Using both, synthetic and real data from tomography, we demonstrate that tensorial template matching is much faster than template matching and has the potential to improve its accuracy</description>

      <title>3D MR Fingerprinting for Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Imaging of Whole Mouse Brain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative MRI enables direct quantification of contrast agent concentrations in contrast-enhanced scans. However, the lengthy scan times required by conventional methods are inadequate for tracking contrast agent transport dynamically in mouse brain. We developed a 3D MR fingerprinting (MRF) method for simultaneous T1 and T2 mapping across the whole mouse brain with 4.3-min temporal resolution. We designed a 3D MRF sequence with variable acquisition segment lengths and magnetization preparations on a 9.4T preclinical MRI scanner. Model-based reconstruction approaches were employed to improve the accuracy and speed of MRF acquisition. The method's accuracy for T1 and T2 measurements was validated in vitro, while its repeatability of T1 and T2 measurements was evaluated in vivo (n=3). The utility of the 3D MRF sequence for dynamic tracking of intracisternally infused Gd-DTPA in the whole mouse brain was demonstrated (n=5). Phantom studies confirmed accurate T1 and T2 measurements by 3D MRF with an undersampling factor up to 48. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRF scans achieved a spatial resolution of 192 x 192 x 500 um3 and a temporal resolution of 4.3 min, allowing for the analysis and comparison of dynamic changes in concentration and transport kinetics of intracisternally infused Gd-DTPA across brain regions. The sequence also enabled highly repeatable, high-resolution T1 and T2 mapping of the whole mouse brain (192 x 192 x 250 um3) in 30 min. We present the first dynamic and multi-parametric approach for quantitatively tracking contrast agent transport in the mouse brain using 3D MRF.</description>

      <title>Mitosis, Cytoskeleton Regulation, and Drug Resistance in Receptor Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During cell division, the receptor triple-negative MDA-MB-231 mitotic spindles are the largest in comparison to other BC cell lines. Many of the MDA-MB-231 spindles exhibit rapid lateral twisting during metaphase, which remains unaffected by knockdown of the oncogene Myc and treatment with inhibitors of the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alone or in any combination. The MDA-MB-231 cells are the most aggressive and rapidly form metastatic tumors in xenograft transplant models, and exhibited very high proliferation rates when plated as three-dimensional cultures in Matrigel. Quantitative image analysis of microtubules (MTs) in six BC cell lines - MDA-MB-231 (receptor negative), HCC-1143 (receptor negative), HCC-3153 (receptor negative), ZR75B (estrogen receptor-positive), LY2 (progesterone receptor-positive), HCC-1428 (estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive) - demonstrated that the rotational spindle rocking of MDA-MB-231 cells during metaphase appears coupled with a significant increase in MT polymerization rates during interphase, which likely shortens interphase and accelerates cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. Unlike the uniform treadmilling rates of about 21 um/min in kinetochore MTs during metaphase we measured across cell lines, MDA-MB-231 cells in interphase exhibit the fastest MT polymerization dynamics of about 19 um/min and this is coupled with abnormal mitotic spindle oscillations of almost 30 um/min. This aberrant behavior in MDA-MB-231 spindles may represent a therapeutically targetable disrupted mechanism of spindle positioning in receptor triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells leading to tumor aggressiveness. In this manuscript, we outline a strategy for the selection of the most optimal tubulin inhibitor based on the ability to affect MT dynamics.</description>

      <title>Within-vector viral dynamics challenges how to model the extrinsic incubation period for major arboviruses: dengue, Zika, and chikungunya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00409</link>

Abstract: Arboviruses represent a significant threat to human, animal, and plant health worldwide. To elucidate transmission, anticipate their spread and efficiently control them, mechanistic modelling has proven its usefulness. However, most models rely on assumptions about how the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) is represented: the intra-vector viral dynamics (IVD), occurring during the EIP, is approximated by a single state. After an average duration, all exposed vectors become infectious. Behind this are hidden two strong hypotheses: (i) EIP is exponentially distributed in the vector population; (ii) viruses successfully cross the infection, dissemination, and transmission barriers in all exposed vectors. To assess these hypotheses, we developed a stochastic compartmental model which represents successive IVD stages, associated to the crossing or not of these three barriers. We calibrated the model using an ABC-SMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo) method with model selection. We systematically searched for literature data on experimental infections of Aedes mosquitoes infected by either dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses. We demonstrated the discrepancy between the exponential hypothesis and observed EIP distributions for dengue and Zika viruses and identified more relevant EIP distributions . We also quantified the fraction of infected mosquitoes eventually becoming infectious, highlighting that often only a small fraction crosses the three barriers. This work provides a generic modelling framework applicable to other arboviruses for which similar data are available. Our model can also be coupled to population-scale models to aid future arbovirus control.</description>
