      <title>Assessing the Spatial and Temporal Risk of HPAIV Transmission to Danish Cattle via Wild Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) panzootic has severely impacted wild bird populations worldwide, with documented (zoonotic) transmission to mammals, including humans. Ongoing HPAI outbreaks on U.S. cattle farms have raised concerns about potential spillover of virus from birds to cattle in other countries, including Denmark. In the EU, the Bird Flu Radar tool, coordinated by EFSA, monitors the spatio-temporal risk of HPAIV infection in wild bird populations. A preparedness tool to assess the spillover risk to the cattle industry is currently lacking, despite its critical importance. This study aims to assess the temporal and spatial risk of HPAI virus (HPAIV) spillover from wild birds, particularly waterfowl, into cattle populations in Denmark. To support this assessment, a spillover transmission model is developed by integrating two well-established surveillance tools, eBird and Bird Flu Radar, in combination with global cattle density data. The generated quantitative risk maps reveal the heterogeneous temporal and spatial distribution of HPAIV spillover risk from wild birds to cattle across Denmark. The highest risk periods are observed during calendar weeks 50 to 10. The estimated total number of spillover cases nationwide is 1.93 (95% CI: 0.48, 4.98) in 2024, and 0.62 cases (95% CI: 0.15, 1.25) in 2025. These risk estimates provide valuable insights to support veterinary contingency planning and enable targeted allocation of resources in highrisk areas for the early detection of HPAIV in cattle.</description>

      <title>Anemia, weight, and height among children under five in Peru from 2007 to 2022: A Panel Data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Econometrics in general, and Panel Data methods in particular, are becoming crucial in Public Health Economics and Social Policy analysis. In this discussion paper, we employ a helpful approach of Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) to assess if there are statistically relevant relationships between hemoglobin (adjusted to sea-level), weight, and height from 2007 to 2022 in children up to five years of age in Peru. By using this method, we may find a tool that allows us to confirm if the relationships considered between the target variables by the Peruvian agencies and authorities are in the right direction to fight against chronic malnutrition and stunting.</description>

      <title>Optimum Contribution Selection for Honeybees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1997, T. H. E. Meuwissen published a groundbreaking article titled 'Maximizing the response of selection with a predefined rate of inbreeding', in which he provided an optimized solution for the trade-off between genetic response and inbreeding avoidance in animal breeding. Evidently, this issue is highly relevant for the honeybee with its small breeding population sizes. However, the genetic peculiarities of bees have thus far prevented an application of the theory to this species. The present manuscript intends to fill this desideratum. It develops the necessary bee-specific theory and introduces a small R script that implements Optimum Contribution Selection (OCS) for honeybees. While researching for this manuscript, we found it rather cumbersome that even though Meuwissen's theory is 28 years old and has sparked research in many new directions, to our knowledge, there is still no comprehensive textbook on the topic. Instead, all relevant information had to be extracted from several articles, leading to a steep learning curve. We anticipate that many honeybee breeding scientists with a putative interest in OCS for honeybees have little to no experience with classical OCS. Thus, we decided to embed our new derivations into a general introduction to OCS that then specializes more and more to the honeybee case. The result are these 121 pages, of which we hope that at least the first sections can also be of use for breeding theorists concerned with other species than honeybees.</description>

      <title>Complex multiannual cycles of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: persistence and the role of stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae are characterized by complex and poorly understood multiannual cycles, posing challenges for forecasting. Using Bayesian methods to fit a seasonally forced transmission model to long-term surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025), we investigate the mechanisms driving recurrent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae. The period of the multiannual cycles (predominantly approx. 5 years in Denmark) are explained as a consequence of the interaction of two time-scales in the system, one intrinsic and one extrinsic (seasonal). While it provides an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), we find that the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, failing to reproduce the observed 4-5-year periodicity long-term. Upon further analysis, the system is found to exhibit transient chaos and thus high sensitivity to stochasticity. We show that environmental (but not purely demographic) stochasticity can sustain the multi-year cycles via stochastic resonance. The disruptive effects of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on M. pneumoniae circulation constitute a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations of deterministic epidemic models for long-term prediction. More generally, our results emphasize the potential role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional scaling informed by $F$-statistic: Visualizing grouped microbiome data with inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a dimensionality reduction technique for microbial ecology data analysis that represents the multivariate structure while preserving pairwise distances between samples. While its improvement has enhanced the ability to reveal data patterns by sample groups, these MDS-based methods require prior assumptions for inference, limiting their application in general microbiome analysis. In this study, we introduce a new MDS-based ordination, $F$-informed MDS, which configures the data distribution based on the $F$-statistic, the ratio of dispersion between groups sharing common and different characteristics. Using simulated compositional datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to hyperparameter selection while maintaining statistical significance throughout the ordination process. Various quality metrics for evaluating dimensionality reduction confirm that $F$-informed MDS is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in preserving both local and global data structures. Its application to a diatom-associated bacterial community suggests the role of this new method in interpreting the community response to the host. Our approach offers a well-founded refinement of MDS that aligns with statistical test results, which can be beneficial for broader compositional data analyses in microbiology and ecology. This new visualization tool can be incorporated into standard microbiome data analyses.</description>
