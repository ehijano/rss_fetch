      <title>2-dimensional self-distributive non-counital bialgebras and knot invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the preprint of V. Bardakov, T. Kozlovskaya, D. Talalaev (Self-distributive bialgebras, arXiv:2501.19152) it was formulated a problem of classification of self-distributive bialgebras and was given classification of two-dimensional counital self-distributive bialgebras. In this paper, we consider non-counital case. We find all 2-dimensional algebras of this type. In constructed algebras we study the question of finding quandles for constructing knot invariants. This activity is part of the overall program for the linearization of the concepts of rack and quandle and the development of the representations theory of these structures.</description>

      <title>Hall Algebras and Edge Contractions with Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of Hall algebras and edge contractions by generalizing Yiqiang Li's work to contraction along vertices with multiple edges. Using the edge contractions, we establish new embeddings among Hall algebras in this broader setting. Our results demonstrate that these embeddings preserve key algebraic structures, including Hopf algebra operations.</description>

      <title>The elliptic Hall algebra and the double Dyck path algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the positive half $\mathcal{E}_{q,t}^{&gt;}$ of the elliptic Hall algebra is embedded as a natural spherical subalgebra inside the double Dyck path algebra $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$ introduced by Carlsson, Mellit and the second author. For this, we use the Ding-Iohara-Miki presentation of the elliptic Hall algebra and identify the generators inside $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$. In order to obtain the entire elliptic Hall algebra $\mathcal{E}_{q,t}$, we define a ``double'' $\mathbb{DB}_{q,t}$ of the double Dyck path algebra, together with its positive and negative subalgebras and an involution that exchanges them.</description>

      <title>Yang-Baxter Hochschild Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Braided algebras are associative algebras endowed with a Yang-Baxter operator that satisfies certain compatibility conditions involving the multiplication. Along with Hochschild cohomology of algebras, there is also a notion of Yang-Baxter cohomology, which is associated to any Yang-Baxter operator. In this article, we introduce and study a cohomology theory for braided algebras in dimensions 2 and 3, that unifies Hochschild and Yang-Baxter cohomology theories, and generalizes to all dimensions in characteristic $2$. We show that its second cohomology group classifies infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras. We provide infinite families of examples of braided algebras, including Hopf algebras, tensorized multiple conjugation quandles, and braided Frobenius algebras. Moreover, we derive the obstructions to higher deformations, which lie in the third cohomology group. Relations to Hopf algebra cohomology are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Deformation Cohomology for Braided Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Braided algebras are algebraic structures consisting of an algebra endowed with a Yang-Baxter operator, satisfying some compatibility conditions.Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology was introduced by the authors to classify infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras, and determine obstructions to higher order deformations. Several examples of braided algebras satisfy a weaker version of commutativity, which is called braided commutativity and involves the Yang-Baxter operator of the algebra. We extend the theory of Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology to study braided commutative deformations of braided algebras. The resulting cohomology theory classifies infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras that are braided commutative, and provides obstructions for braided commutative higher order deformations. We consider braided commutativity for Hopf algebras in detail, and obtain some classes of nontrivial examples.</description>

      <title>Rectangular recurrence relations in $\mathfrak{gl}_{n}$ and $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ invariant integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method is introduced to derive general recurrence relations for off-shell Bethe vectors in quantum integrable models with either type $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ or type $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ symmetries. These recurrence relations describe how to add a single parameter $z$, to specific subsets of Bethe parameters, expressing the resulting Bethe vector as a linear combination of monodromy matrix entries that act on Bethe vectors which do not depend on $z$. We refer to these recurrence relations as rectangular because the monodromy matrix entries involved are drawn from the upper-right rectangular part of the matrix. This construction is achieved within the framework of the zero mode method.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Nahm sums for symmetrizable matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nahm sums are specific $q$-hypergeometric series associated with symmetric positive definite matrices. In this paper we study Nahm sums associated with symmetrizable matrices. We show that one direction of Nahm's conjecture, which was proven by Calegari, Garoufalidis, and Zagier for the symmetric case, also holds for the symmetrizable case. This asserts that the modularity of a Nahm sum implies that a certain element in a Bloch group associated with the Nahm sum is a torsion element. During the proof, we investigate the radial asymptotics of Nahm sums. Finally, we provide lists of candidates of modular Nahm sums for symmetrizable matrices based on numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Heat operators and isometry groups of Cuntz-Krieger algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces heat semigroups of topological Markov chains and Cuntz-Krieger algebras by means of spectral noncommutative geometry. Using recent advances on the logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces, we construct spectral triples on Cuntz-Krieger algebras from singular integral operators. These spectral triples exhaust odd K-homology and for Cuntz algebras we can compute their heat operators explicitly as Riesz potential operators. We also describe their isometry group in terms of the automorphism group of the underlying directed graph and prove that the Voiculescu noncommutative topological entropy vanishes on isometries.</description>

      <title>Second bounded cohomology of knot quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the bounded cohomology of quandles and its applications to knot theory. We establish two key results that provide sufficient conditions for the infinite dimensionality of the second bounded cohomology of quandles. The first condition involves a subspace of homogeneous group quasimorphisms on the inner automorphism group of the quandle, whereas the second condition concerns the vanishing of the stable commutator length on a subgroup of this inner automorphism group. As topological applications, we show that the second bounded cohomology of the quandle of any non-split link whose link group is non-solvable as well as the quandle of any split link, is infinite dimensional. From these results, we conclude that the second bounded cohomology of the knot quandle detects the unknot. On the algebraic side, we prove that the second bounded cohomology of a free product of quandles is infinite dimensional if the inner automorphism group of at least one of the free factors is amenable. This leads to the result that the second bounded cohomology of free quandles of rank greater than one, as well as their canonical quotients, is infinite dimensional.</description>
