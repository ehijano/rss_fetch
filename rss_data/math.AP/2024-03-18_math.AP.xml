      <title>Critical, stability and higher-order analysis for Hardy type inequalities on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on three main objectives related to Hardy-type inequalities on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. Firstly, we explore critical Hardy-type inequalities that contain logarithmic terms, highlighting their significance. Secondly, we examine the stability of both critical and subcritical cases of the Hardy inequality. Lastly, we establish two weighted Hardy-type inequalities where singularities appear at the origin as well as boundary and we discuss their implications for higher-order operators. Our results improve upon previous findings and also present new higher-order versions of these inequalities as additional outcomes.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability of Smooth Solitary Waves for the Novikov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital stability of smooth solitary wave solutions of the Novikov equation, which is a Camassa-Holm type equation with cubic nonlinearities. These solitary waves are shown to exist as a one-parameter family (up to spatial translations) parameterized by their asymptotic endstate, and are encoded as critical points of a particular action functional. As an important step in our analysis we must study the spectrum the Hessian of this action functional, which turns out to be a nonlocal integro-differential operator acting on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. We provide a combination of analytical and numerical evidence that the necessary spectral hypotheses always holds for the Novikov equation. Together with a detailed study of the associated Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition, our analysis indicates that all smooth solitary wave solutions of the Novikov equation are nonlinearly orbitally stable.</description>

      <title>Local existence and uniqueness of solution to the two-dimensional inhomogeneous Prandtl equations by energy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the local existence and uniqueness result for the inhomogeneous Prandtl equations in dimension two by energy method. First of all, for the homogeneous case, the local-in-time well-posedness theory of unsteady Prandtl equations was obtained by [Alexandre, Wang, Xu, Yang, J. Am. Math. Soc., 28 (3), 745-784 (2015)] and [Masmoudi, Wong, Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 68 (10), 1683-1741 (2015)] independently by energy method without any transformation. However, for the inhomogeneous case, the appearance of density will create some new difficulties for us to overcome the loss of tangential derivative of horizontal velocity. Thus, our first result is to overcome the loss of tangential derivative such that one can establish the local-in-time well-posedness result for the inhomogeneous Prandtl equations by energy method. Secondly, for the homogeneous case, the local-in-x well-posedness in higher regular space for the steady Prandtl equations was obtained by [Guo, Iyer, Comm. Math. Phys., 382 (3), 1403-447 (2021)] by energy method since they firstly found the good quantity(called `quotient'). With the help of this quotient, our second result is to establish the local-in-x well-posedness in higher regular Sobolev space for the steady inhomogeneous Prandtl equations.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for an Isotropic Landau Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the recent ideas of Guillen and Silvestre in $[9]$, we prove that the Fisher information is non-increasing along the flow of the isotropic Landau equation. We then use this fact to deduce global existence for the equation
  $\partial_t f = (-\Delta)^{-1}f \cdot \Delta f + f^2$ under a relatively lax set of conditions on the initial data. In particular, we remove the restrictive radially decreasing assumption of previous works.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal-to-local convergence rates for strong solutions to a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with singular potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish the nonlocal-to-local convergence of strong solutions to a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model with singular potential describing immiscible, viscous two-phase flows with matched densities, which is referred to as the Model H. This means that we show that the strong solutions to the nonlocal Model H converge to the strong solution to the local Model H as the weight function in the nonlocal interaction kernel approaches the delta distribution. Compared to previous results in the literature, our main novelty is to further establish corresponding convergence rates. Before investigating the nonlocal-to-local convergence, we first need to ensure the strong well-posedness of the nonlocal Model H. In two dimensions, this result can already be found in the literature, whereas in three dimensions, it will be shown in the present paper. Moreover, in both two and three dimensions, we establish suitable uniform bounds on the strong solutions of the nonlocal Model H, which are essential to prove the nonlocal-to-local convergence results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we concentrate on the connection between Boltzmann equation and stationary equations. To our knowledge, the stationary Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, the stationary Euler equations and the stationary Stokes equations are formally derived by moment estimate in the first time and extend the results of Bardos, Golse, and Levermore in J.

      <title>From habitat decline to collapse: a spatially explicit approach connecting habitat degradation to destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Habitat loss, through degradation and destruction of viable habitat, has a well-documented and undeniable impact on the sustainability of ecosystems [Diaz et al. (2019), Pimm et al. (2014), Pimm et al. (2000)]. Moreover, most habitat loss is anthropogenic [Jacobson et al. (2019)]. Understanding the relationships between varying degrees of habitat degradation, movement strategies, and population dynamics on species persistence is crucial. We establish a robust connection between habitat degradation and destruction using a reaction-diffusion equation framework. Motivated by the recent work [Salmaniw et al. (2022)], we consider an intrinsic growth rate function that features a logistic-type growth in the viable habitat but decays at rate $c\geq0$ in the degraded region(s). In the limit as $c \to \infty$, the solution to the habitat degradation problem converges uniformly to the solution of a related habitat destruction problem. When the habitat destruction problem predicts deterministic extinction, a unique value $c_0$ exists, the extinction threshold, from which any further habitat degradation leads to deterministic extinction. This extinction threshold can be bounded below by a constant depending on the size of the degraded region and the habitat quality in the undisturbed region. To show these results, we investigate the eigenvalue problems related to each model formulation and establish a convergence result between the principal eigenvalues and their associated eigenfunctions, providing a precise analytical connection between habitat degradation and destruction in a general setting applicable to any species adopting diffusive movement strategies.</description>

      <title>Transverse Magnetic ENZ Resonators: Robustness and Optimal Shape Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain ``geometric-invariant resonant cavities'' introduced by Liberal et. al in a 2016 Nature Comm. paper, modeled using the transverse magnetic reduction of Maxwell's equations. The cross-section consists of a dielectric inclusion surrounded by an ``epsilon-near-zero'' (ENZ) shell. When the shell has the right area, its interaction with the inclusion produces a resonance. Mathematically, the resonance is a nontrivial solution of a 2D divergence-form Helmoltz equation $\nabla \cdot \left(\varepsilon^{-1}(x,\omega) \nabla u \right) + \omega^2 \mu u = 0$, where $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is the (complex-valued) dielectric permittivity, $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability, and a homogeneous Neumann condition is imposed at the outer boundary of the shell. This is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, since $\varepsilon$ depends on $\omega$. Use of an ENZ material in the shell means that $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is nearly zero there, so the PDE is rather singular. Working with a Lorentz model for the dispersion of the ENZ material, we put the discussion of Liberal et.~al.~on a sound foundation by proving the existence of the anticipated resonance when the loss is sufficiently small. Our analysis is perturbative in character despite the apparently singular form of the PDE. While the existence of the resonance depends only on the area of the ENZ shell, the rate at which it decays depends on the shape of the shell. We consider an associated optimal design problem: what shape shell gives the slowest-decaying resonance? We prove that if the dielectric inclusion is a ball then the optimal shell is a concentric annulus. For an inclusion of any shape, we study a convex relaxation of the design problem using tools from convex duality, and discuss the conjecture that our relaxed problem amounts to considering homogenization-like limits of nearly optimal designs.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behaviour of the solutions to widely degenerate p-Laplace equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Dirichlet problems with a widely degenerate equation. Through a well-known result by Talenti, we explicitly express the gradient of the solution $u_p$ outside the ball with a radius of $1$, if the datum $f$ is a non-negative radially decreasing function. This allows us to analyze the behaviour of $u_p$ as $p \to 1^+$ and to establish some higher regularity results, assuming the datum $f$ in a suitable Lorentz space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent breakthrough on smooth imploding solutions of compressible Euler, we construct self-similar smooth imploding solutions of isentropic relativistic Euler equations with isothermal equation of state $p=\frac1\ell\varrho$ for \textit{all} $\ell&gt;1$ in physical space dimension $d=2,3$ and for $\ell&gt;1$ close to 1 in higher dimensions. This work is a crucial step toward solving the long-standing problem: finite time blow-up of the supercritical defocusing nonlinear wave equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and regularity of convex solutions to the first initial-boundary value problem of the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere equation $$
  \left\{\begin{eqnarray}
  &amp;u_t=\det D^2u\quad\text{ in } Q_T, \\
  &amp;u=\phi\quad\text{ on }\partial_pQ_T,
  \end{eqnarray}\right. $$ where $\phi$ is a smooth function, $Q_T=\Omega\times(0,T]$, $\partial_p Q_T$ is the parabolic boundary of $Q_T$, and $\Omega$ is a uniformly convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary. Our approach can also be used to prove similar results for $\gamma$-Gauss curvature flow with any $0&lt;\gamma\le 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a non-linear, non-local model describing the evolution of a single species. We investigate scenarios where the spatial domain is either an arbitrary bounded and open subset of the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space or a periodic environment modeled by $n$-dimensional torus. The analysis includes the study of spectrum of the linear, bounded operator in the considered equation, which is a scaled, non-local analogue of classical Laplacian with Neumann boundaries. In particular we show the explicit formulas for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Moreover we show the asymptotic behaviour of eigenvalues. Within the context of the non-linear evolution problem, we establish the existence of an invariant region, give a criterion for convergence to the mean mass, and construct spatially heterogeneous steady states.</description>

      <title>A singular perturbation result for infinite-dimensional coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with an infinite dimensional version of the singular perturbation method. It is, more precisely, an exponential stability result for a system composed by a fast and a slow dynamics that may involve infinite-dimensional dynamics where, roughly speaking, the system can be approximated into two decoupled systems for which the stability conditions are easier to check. The classical singular perturbation result states that, as soon as the fast system is sufficiently fast, then the exponential stability conditions for the full-system can be reduced to the exponential stability conditions for the two decoupled systems. In this article, it is proved that the classical singular perturbation method can be applied when facing with a slow infinite-dimensional system coupled with a fast finite-dimensional system. The proof relies on a Lyapunov approach, more precisely with the construction a functional inspired by the forwarding method. The well-posedness proof is obtained thanks to the regular system theory. In addition to these result, a Tikhnov theorem is proved. Namely, supposing that the initial condition depends on $\varepsilon$, the parameter modeling the difference between the two time-scales, the trajectory of the full-system is proved to depend linearly on $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Inverse Coefficient Problem for One-Dimensional Subdiffusion with Data on Disjoint Sets in Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate an inverse coefficient problem for the one-dimensional subdiffusion model, which involves a Caputo fractional derivative in time. The inverse problem is to determine two coefficients and multiple parameters (the order, and length of the interval) from one pair of lateral Cauchy data. The lateral Cauchy data are given on disjoint sets in time with a single excitation and the measurement is made on a time sequence located outside the support of the excitation. We prove two uniqueness results for different lateral Cauchy data. The analysis is based on the solution representation, analyticity of the observation and a refined version of inverse Sturm-Liouville theory due to Sini [35]. Our results heavily exploit the memory effect of fractional diffusion for the unique recovery of the coefficients in the model. Several numerical experiments are also presented to complement the analysis.</description>

Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolevextension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential oper-ators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitzdomains, but also domains with fractal boundaries. Our formulation does not involveany measures on the boundary. We discuss basic properties of these operators and usethem to generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work considers a system of fractional order partial differential equations. The existence and uniqueness theorems for the classical solution of initial-boundary value problems are proved in two cases: 1) the right-hand side of the equation does not depend on the solution of the problem and 2) it depends on the solution, but at the same time satisfies the classical Lipschitz condition with respect to this variable and an additional condition which guarantees a global existence of the solution. Sufficient conditions are found (in some cases they are necessary) on the initial function and on the right-hand side of the equation, which ensure the existence of a classical solution. In previously known works, linear but more general systems of fractional pseudodifferential equations were considered and the existence of a weak solution was proven in the special classes of distributions.</description>

      <title>An extension operator for manifold-valued Sobolev maps on perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by manifold-constrained homogenization problems, we construct a scale-independent extension operator for Sobolev functions defined on a perforated domain and taking values in a compact connected Riemannian manifold without boundary. The proof carefully combines the prominent extension result by Acerbi et al., with a retraction argument which heavily relies on the topological structure of the manifold itself. With the aim of providing necessary conditions for the extendability of Sobolev maps between manifolds, we additionally investigate the relationship between this problem and the surjectivity of the trace operator for such functions.</description>

      <title>Regularity and nondegeneracy for nonlocal Bernoulli problems with variable kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Bernoulli free boundary problem where the underlying differential operator is a nonlocal, non-translation-invariant elliptic operator of order $2s\in (0,2)$. Because of the lack of translation invariance, the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension is unavailable, and we must work with the nonlocal problem directly instead of transforming to a thin free boundary problem. We prove global H\"older continuity of minimizers for both the one- and two-phase problems. Next, for the one-phase problem, we show H\"older continuity at the free boundary with the optimal exponent $s$. We also prove matching nondegeneracy estimates. A key novelty of our work is that all our findings hold without requiring any regularity assumptions on the kernel of the nonlocal operator. This characteristic makes them crucial in the development of a universal regularity theory for nonlocal free boundary problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the graphical mean curvature flow of maps ${\bf f}:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$, $m\ge 2$, and derive estimates on the growth rates of the evolved graphs, based on a new version of the maximum principle for properly immersed submanifolds that extends the well-known maximum principle of Ecker and Huisken derived in their seminal paper [10]. In the case of uniformly area decreasing maps ${\bf f}:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^2$, $m\ge 2$, we use this maximum principle to show that the graphicality and the area decreasing property are preserved. Moreover, if the initial graph is asymptotically conical at infinity, we prove that the normalized mean curvature flow smoothly converges to a self-expander.</description>

      <title>A new coupled electro-thermo-fluid radiofrequency model of cardiac tissue: Mathematical modeling, analysis and numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear reaction-diffusion-fluid system that simulates radiofrequency ablation within cardiac tissue.
  The model conveys the dynamic evolution of temperature and electric potential in both the fluid and solid regions, along with the evolution of velocity within the solid region.
  By formulating the system that describes the phenomena across the entire domain, encompassing both solid and fluid phases, we proceed to an analysis of well-posedness, considering a broad class of right-hand side terms. The system involves parameters such as heat conductivity, kinematic viscosity, and electrical conductivity, all of which exhibit nonlinearity contingent upon the temperature variable.
  The mathematical analysis extends to establishing the existence of a global solution, employing the Faedo-Galerkin method in a three-dimensional space.
  To enhance the practical applicability of our theoretical results, we complement our study with a series of numerical experiments. We implement the discrete system using the finite element method for spatial discretization and an Euler scheme for temporal discretization. Nonlinear parameters are linearized through decoupling systems, as introduced in our continuous analysis. These experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the theoretical findings we have established.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing recent mathematical advances in proving stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay rates and nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes with small angular momentum, we investigate the detailed asymptotic behaviors of gravitational waves generated in these spacetimes. Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a well known fact that the geometry of a superconducting sample influences the distribution of the surface superconductivity for strong applied magnetic fields. For instance, the presence of corners induces geometric terms described through effective models in sector-like regions. We study the connection between two effective models for the offset of superconductivity and for surface superconductivity introduced in \cite{BNF} and \cite{CG2}, respectively. We prove that the transition between the two models is continuous with respect to the magnetic field strength, and, as a byproduct, we deduce the existence of a minimizer at the threshold for both effective problems. Furthermore, as a consequence, we disprove a conjecture stated in \cite{CG2} concerning the dependence of the corner energy on the angle close to the threshold.</description>

Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian in a bounded and simply connected planar domain, with uniform magnetic field and Neumann boundary conditions. We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured B.~Helffer and S.~Fournais, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show existence and pathwise uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions to a pseudomonotone stochastic evolution problem on a bounded domain $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and random initial data $u_0\in L^2(\Omega;L^2(D))$. The main novelty is the presence of a merely H\"older continuous multiplicative noise term. In order to show the well-posedness, we simultaneously regularize the H\"older noise term by inf-convolution and add a perturbation by a higher order operator to the equation. Using a stochastic compactness argument we may pass to the limit and we obtain first a martingale solution. Then by a pathwise uniqueness argument we get existence of a probabilistically strong solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.05017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global existence of smooth solutions to the 2D isentropic and irrotational Euler equations for Chaplygin gases with a general class of short pulse initial data, which, in particular, resolves in this special case, the Majda's conjecture on the non-formation of shock waves of solutions from smooth initial data for multi-dimensional nonlinear symmetric systems which are totally linearly degenerate. Comparing to the 4D case, the major difficulties in this paper are caused by the slower time decay and the largeness of the solutions to the 2D quasilinear wave equation, some new auxiliary energies and multipliers are introduced to overcome these difficulties.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the uniqueness of ground states to the following fractional nonlinear elliptic equation with harmonic potential, $$ (-\Delta)^s u+ \left(\omega+|x|^2\right) u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in}\,\, \R^n, $$ where $n \geq 1$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $\omega&gt;-\lambda_{1,s}$, $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2n}{(n-2s)^+}$, $\lambda_{1,s}&gt;0$ is the lowest eigenvalue of $(-\Delta)^s + |x|^2$. The fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$ is characterized as $\mathcal{F}((-\Delta)^{s}u)(\xi)=|\xi|^{2s} \mathcal{F}(u)(\xi)$ for $\xi \in \R^n$, where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes the Fourier transform. This solves an open question in \cite{SS} concerning the uniqueness of ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work contributes to nonlocal vector calculus as an indispensable mathematical tool for the study of nonlocal models that arises in a variety of applications. We define the nonlocal half-ball gradient, divergence and curl operators with general kernel functions (integrable or fractional type with finite or infinite supports) and study the associated nonlocal vector identities. We study the nonlocal function space on bounded domains associated with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions and the half-ball gradient operator and show it is a separable Hilbert space with smooth functions dense in it. A major result is the nonlocal Poincar\'e inequality, based on which a few applications are discussed, and these include applications to nonlocal convection-diffusion, nonlocal correspondence model of linear elasticity, and nonlocal Helmholtz decomposition on bounded domains.</description>

Abstract: We study the problems of uniqueness for Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equations, which are semilinear heat equations with the singular potential (Hardy type) or the increasing potential (H\'enon type) in the nonlinear term. To deal with the Hardy-H\'enon type nonlinearities, we employ weighted Lorentz spaces as solution spaces. We prove unconditional uniqueness and non-uniqueness, and we establish uniqueness criterion for Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equations in the weighted Lorentz spaces. The results extend the previous works on the Fujita equation and Hardy equations in Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $u$ solves the fractional parabolic equation $(\partial_t - \Delta )^s u = Vu$ in $B_5 \times (-25, 0]$ ($0&lt;s&lt;1$) such that $u(\cdot, 0) \not\equiv 0$, then the maximal vanishing order of $u$ in space-time at $(0,0)$ is upper bounded by $C\left(1+\|V\|_{C^{1}_{(x,t)}}^{1/2s}\right)$. As $s \to 1$, it converges to the sharp maximal order of vanishing due to Donnelly-Fefferman and Bakri. This quantifies a space like strong unique continuation result recently proved in [3]. The proof is achieved by means of a new quantitative Carleman estimate that we derive for the corresponding extension problem combined with a quantitative monotonicity in time result and a compactness argument.</description>

The complete classification of singular points has been obtained through establishing a new Weiss-type monotonicity formula. Upon these results, we prove that only $90^\circ$ corner type of singularity could happen at the boundary of a Lipschitz rotating vortex patch, while the other parts are $C^\infty$ smooth.</description>

Abstract: The elastic energy of a bending-resistant interface depends both on its geometry and its material composition. We consider such a heterogeneous interface in the plane, modeled by a curve equipped with an additional density function. The resulting energy captures the complex interplay between curvature and density effects, resembling the Canham-Helfrich functional. We describe the curve by its inclination angle, so that the equilibrium equations reduce to an elliptic system of second order. After a brief variational discussion, we investigate the associated nonlocal $L^2$-gradient flow evolution, a coupled quasilinear parabolic problem. We analyze the (non)preservation of quantities such as convexity, positivity, and symmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the system. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we overview the recent progresses on the lifespan estimates of classical solutions of the initial value problems for nonlinear wave equations in one space dimension. There are mainly two directions of the developments on the model equations which ensure the optimality of the general theory. One is on the so-called "combined effect" of two kinds of the different nonlinear terms, which shows the possibility to improve the general theory. Another is on the extension to the non-autonomous nonlinear terms which includes the application to nonlinear damped wave equations with the time-dependent critical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For singular mean field equations defined on a compact Riemann surface, we prove the uniqueness of bubbling solutions as far as blowup points are either regular points or non-quantized singular sources. In particular the uniqueness result covers the most general case extending or improving all previous works of Bartolucci-Jevnikar-Lee-Yang \cite{bart-4,bart-4-2} and Wu-Zhang \cite{wu-zhang-ccm}. For example, unlike previous results, we drop the assumption of singular sources being critical points of a suitably defined Kirchoff-Routh type functional. Our argument is based on refined estimates, robust and flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of problems requiring a delicate blowup analysis. In particular we come up with a major simplification of previous uniqueness proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide a survey of Fuglede's flux extensions of first order partial differential operators, a concept largely forgotten today. A long the way we also survey the classical weak and strong extensions of PDE operators and the works of Friedrichs and H\"ormander. We give several applications of this theory showing its usefulness, as well as connecting it to more recent developments in connection to various sharp versions of the divergence theorem. In particular, we use it to prove a generalization of Morera's theorem valid for general first order operators. Using this theory we also prove a new local limit formula for the maximal extension of a first order operator. We initiate a study of this limit and connect it to the wave cone of the operator, a concept that first arose in the theory of compensated compactness. Hopefully, this will contribute to a rival of Fuglede's beautiful ideas.</description>

      <title>On blow-up to the one-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosity and vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem of the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosity and vacuum in $\mathbb{R}$, where the viscosity depends on the density in a super-linear power law(i.e., $\mu(\rho)=\rho^\delta, \delta&gt;1$). We first obtain the local existence of the regular solution, then show that the regular solution will blow-up in finite time if initial data has an isolated mass group, no matter how small and smooth the initial data are. It is worth mentioning that based on the transport structure of some intrinsic variables, we obtain the $L^\infty$ bound of the density, which helps to remove the restriction $\delta\leq \gamma$ in Li-Pan-Zhu[21] and Huang-Wang-Zhu[13].</description>

      <title>Fine boundary regularity for the singular fractional p-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary weighted regularity of weak solutions $u$ to a $s$-fractional $p$-Laplacian equation in a bounded smooth domain $\Omega$ with bounded reaction and nonlocal Dirichlet type boundary condition, in the singular case $p\in(1,2)$ and with $s\in(0,1)$. We prove that $u/{\rm d}_\Omega^s$ has a $\alpha$-H\"older continuous extension to the closure of $\Omega$, ${\rm d}_\Omega(x)$ meaning the distance of $x$ from the complement of $\Omega$. This result corresponds to that of ref. [28] for the degenerate case $p\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear potential theoretic methods in nonuniformly ellliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonuniform ellipticity is a classical topic in the theory of partial differential equations. While several results in regularity theory have been adding up over decades, many basic issues, as for instance the validity of Schauder theory and sharp dependence of regularity upon data, remained opened for a while. In these notes we give an overview of recent results and techniques about the topic, that, via a novel use of nonlinear potential theoretic methods, allow to answer several of the above questions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of the Stokes flow in an exterior domain with slowly decaying initial data and its application to the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the decay rate of the Stokes flow in an exterior domain with a slowly decaying initial data ${\bf u}_0(x)=O(|x|^{-\al}), 0&lt;\al\leq n$. %which is not $L^1$ integrable. As an application we find the unique strong solution of the Navier-Stokes equations corresponding to a slowly decaying initial data. We also derive the pointwise decay estimate of the Navier-Stokes flow. Our decay rates will be optimal compared with the decay rates of the heat flow.</description>

      <title>Conformal Scattering of Maxwell Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a complete conformal scattering theory for finite energy Maxwell potentials on a class of curved, asymptotically flat spacetimes with prescribed smoothness of null infinity and a non-zero ADM mass. In order to define the full set of scattering data, we construct a Lorenz-like gauge which makes the field equations hyperbolic and non-singular up to null infinity, and reduces to an intrinsically solvable ODE on null infinity. We develop a method to solve the characteristic Cauchy problem from this scattering data based on a theorem of H\"ormander. In the case of Minkowski space, we further investigate an alternative formulation of the scattering theory by using the Morawetz vector field instead of the usual timelike Killing vector field.</description>

      <title>Information geometric regularization of the barotropic Euler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key numerical difficulty in compressible fluid dynamics is the formation of shock waves. Shock waves feature jump discontinuities in the velocity and density of the fluid and thus preclude the existence of classical solutions to the compressible Euler equations. Weak entropy solutions are commonly defined by viscous regularization, but even small amounts of viscosity can substantially change the long-term behavior of the solution. In this work, we propose the first inviscid regularization of the multidimensional Euler equation based on ideas from semidefinite programming, information geometry, geometric hydrodynamics, and nonlinear elasticity. From a Lagrangian perspective, shock formation in entropy solutions amounts to inelastic collisions of fluid particles. Their trajectories are akin to that of projected gradient descent on a feasible set of non-intersecting paths. We regularize these trajectories by replacing them with solution paths of interior point methods based on log determinantal barrier functions. These paths are geodesic curves with respect to the information geometry induced by the barrier function. Thus, our regularization replaces the Euclidean geometry of trajectories with a suitable information geometry. We extend this idea to infinite families of paths by viewing Euler's equations as a dynamical system on a diffeomorphism manifold. Our regularization embeds this manifold into an information geometric ambient space, equipping it with a geodesically complete geometry. Expressing the resulting Lagrangian equations in Eulerian form, we derive a regularized Euler equation in conservation form. Numerical experiments on one and two-dimensional problems show its promise as a numerical tool. While we focus on the barotropic Euler equations for concreteness and simplicity of exposition, our regularization easily extends to more general Euler and Navier-Stokes-type equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional Pauli operator describing a charged quantum particle with spin $1/2$ moving on a plane in presence of an orthogonal Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux. We classify all the admissible self-adjont realizations and give a complete picture of their spectral and scattering properties. Symmetries of the resulting Hamiltonians are also discussed, as well as their connection with the Dirac operator perturbed by an Aharonov-Bohm singularity.</description>

      <title>Quantized collision invariants on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a measurable function $g:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to\mathbb{R}$, with $d\geq 3$, satisfies the functional relation \begin{equation*} g(\omega)+g(\omega_*)=g(\omega')+g(\omega_*'), \end{equation*} for all admissible $\omega,\omega_*,\omega',\omega_*'\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ in the sense that \begin{equation*} \omega+\omega_*=\omega'+\omega_*', \end{equation*} if and only if it can be written as \begin{equation*} g(\omega)=A+B\cdot\omega, \end{equation*} for some constants $A\in \mathbb{R}$ and $B\in\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Such functions form a family of quantized collision invariants which play a fundamental role in the study of hydrodynamic regimes of the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation near Fermionic condensates, i.e., at low temperatures. In particular, they characterize the elastic collisional dynamics of Fermions near a statistical equilibrium where quantum effects are predominant.</description>

      <title>New a priori estimate for stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equation with applications to invariant measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the stochastic two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluids, set in a bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider additive noise in the form $G\, dW$, where $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process and $G$ a bounded linear operator with range dense in the domain of $A^\gamma$, $A$ being the Stokes operator. While it is known that existence of invariant measure holds for $\gamma&gt;1/4$, previous results show its uniqueness only for $\gamma &gt; 3/8$. We fill this gap and prove uniqueness and strong mixing property in the range $\gamma \in (1/4, 3/8]$ by adapting the so-called Sobolevski\u{\i}-Kato-Fujita approach to the stochastic N-S equations. This method provides new \textit{a priori} estimates, which entail both better regularity in space for the solution and strong Feller and irreducibility properties for the associated Markov semigroup.</description>

      <title>On the Hamilton-Lott conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $n$-dimensional Ricci flows with non-negative Ricci curvature where the curvature is pointwise controlled by the scalar curvature and bounded by $C/t$, starting at metric cones which are Reifenberg outside the tip. We show that any such flow behaves like a self-similar solution up to an exponential error in time. As an application, we show that smooth $n$-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds which are uniformly PIC1-pinched, with positive asymptotic volume ratio, are Euclidean. This confirms a higher dimensional version of a conjecture of Hamilton and Lott under the assumption of non-collapsing. It also yields a new and more direct proof of the original conjecture of Hamilton and Lott in three dimensions.</description>
