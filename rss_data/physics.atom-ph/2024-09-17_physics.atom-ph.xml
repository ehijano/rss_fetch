      <title>Revised $^3$He nuclear charge radius due to electronic hyperfine mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significant discrepancy in the difference of squared nuclear charge radii $\Delta R^2$ of $^{3,4}$He obtained from electronic-atom or muonic-atom energy levels is a puzzle. In this paper, we show that the tension is resolved by including off-diagonal mixing effects due to the hyperfine interaction. Our findings indicate that the hyperfine mixing effect from the $n\,^3\!S$ and $n\,^1\!S$ states ($n&gt;2$) of $^3$He leads to a $-1.37$ kHz adjustment in the isotope shift of the $2\,^1\!S-2\,^3\!S$ transition, surpassing the current uncertainty by a factor of $7$. This results in a change of $-0.0064~\rm{fm}^2$ in $\Delta R^2$, shifting from $1.0757(15)~\mathrm{fm}^2$ to $1.0693(15)~\mathrm{fm}^2$ as determined by Werf {\it et al.}, significantly reducing the discrepancy with the value of $1.0636(31)~\mathrm{fm}^2$ determined by $\mu\rm{He}^+$, and aligning with the result of $1.069(3)$ $\mathrm{fm}^2$ obtained from the $2\,^3\!S-2\,^3\!P$ transition. This adjustment will result in a noticeable change in the absolute nuclear charge radius of $^{3}$He by $-0.0017~\rm{fm}$, aligning the revised value of $1.9715(11)~\mathrm{fm}$ with the value of $1.97007(94)~\mathrm{fm}$ determined by $\mu^3\rm{He}^+$ within $1\sigma$. Our results offer crucial insights into resolving discrepancy in $\Delta R^2$ for $^{3,4}$He and determining the charge radius of $^3$He.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of electric dipole and quadrupole transitions in $^{224}$Ra$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on spectroscopy of the low-lying electronic transitions in $^{224}$Ra$^+$. The ion's low charge to mass ratio and convenient wavelengths make $^{224}$Ra$^+$ a promising optical clock candidate. We measured the frequencies of the the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{1/2}$ cooling transition, the $^2{S}_{1/2}\ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{D}_{5/2}$ clock transition, the $^2{D}_{3/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ electric dipole transition, and the $^2{D}_{5/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ cleanout transition. From these measurements we calculate the frequencies of the $^2{D}_{3/2}\ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{1/2}$ repump transition, the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{D}_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition, and the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ electric dipole transition.</description>

      <title>An accurate vector optically pumped magnetometer with microwave-driven Rabi frequency measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust calibration of vector optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) is a nontrivial task, but increasingly important for applications requiring high-accuracy such as magnetic navigation, geophysics research, and space exploration. Here, we showcase a vector OPM that utilizes Rabi oscillations driven between the hyperfine manifolds of $^{87}$Rb to measure the direction of a DC magnetic field against the polarization ellipse structure of a microwave field. By relying solely on atomic measurements -- free-induction decay (FID) signals and Rabi measurements across multiple atomic transitions -- this sensor can detect drift in the microwave vector reference and compensate for systematic shifts caused by off-resonant driving, nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) effects, and buffer gas collisions. To facilitate dead-zone-free operation, we also introduce a novel Rabi measurement that utilizes dressed-state resonances that appear during simultaneous Larmor precession and Rabi driving (SPaR). These measurements, performed within a microfabricated vapor cell platform, achieve an average vector accuracy of 0.46 mrad and vector sensitivities down to 11 $\mu$rad$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for geomagnetic field strengths near 50 $\mu$T. This performance surpasses the challenging 1-degree (17 mrad) accuracy threshold of several contemporary OPM methods utilizing atomic vapors with an electromagnetic vector reference.</description>

      <title>Zero- to Ultralow-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) is an NMR modality where experiments are performed in fields at which spin-spin interactions within molecules and materials are stronger than Zeeman interactions. This typically occurs at external fields of microtesla strength or below, considerably smaller than Earth's field. In ZULF NMR, the measurement of spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive means for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting sample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong external magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up new capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to the preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging. Furthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio band, the nuclear spins can be addressed with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and highly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to high-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive materials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not produce resonance line broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible. Notable practical advantages of ZULF NMR spectroscopy are the low cost and relative simplicity and portability of the spectrometer system. In recent years ZULF NMR has become more accessible, thanks to improvements in magnetometer sensitivity and their commercial availability, and the development of hyperpolarization methods that provide a simple means to boost signal strengths by several orders of magnitude. These topics are reviewed and a perspective on potential future avenues of ZULF-NMR research is presented.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of first sound in a weakly interacting ultracold Fermi liquid: an exact calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear depart as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha&gt;0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second order hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multifractal Critical Phases in Two-Dimensional Quasiperiodic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multifractal critical phase (MCP) fundamentally differs from extended and localized phases, exhibiting delocalized distributions in both position and momentum spaces. The investigation on the MCP has largely focused on one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) quasiperiodic model with a MCP. We present its phase diagram and investigate the characteristics of the 2D system's MCP in terms of wave packet diffusion and transport based on this model. We further investigate the movement of the phase boundary induced by the introduction of next-nearest-neighbor hopping by calculating the fidelity susceptibility. Finally, we consider how to realize our studied model in superconducting circuits. Our work opens the door to exploring MCP in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Realization of cold atom gyroscope in space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision gyroscopes in space are essential for fundamental physics research and navigation. Due to its potential high precision, the cold atom gyroscope is expected to be the next generation of gyroscopes in space. Here, we report the first realization of a cold atom gyroscope, which was demonstrated by the atom interferometer installed in the China Space Station (CSS) as a payload. By compensating for CSS's high dynamic rotation rate using a built-in piezoelectric mirror, spatial interference fringes in the interferometer are successfully obtained. Then, the optimized ratio of the Raman laser's angles is derived, the coefficients of the piezoelectric mirror are self-calibrated in orbit, and various systemic effects are corrected. We achieve a rotation measurement resolution of 50*10^-6 rad/s for a single shot and 17*10^-6 rad/s for an average number of 32. The measured rotation is (-1142+/-29)*10^-6 rad/s and is compatible with that recorded by the classical gyroscope of the CSS. This study paves the way for developing high-precision cold atom gyroscopes in space.</description>

      <title>Ytterbium atom interferometry for dark matter searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the projected sensitivity of a laboratory-scale ytterbium atom interferometer to scalar, vector, and axion dark matter signals. A frequency ratio measurement between two transitions in $^{171}$Yb enables a search for variations of the fine-structure constant that could surpass existing limits by a factor of 100 in the mass range $10^{-22}$ eV to $10^{-16}$ eV. Differential accelerometry between Yb isotopes yields projected sensitivities to scalar and vector dark matter couplings that are stronger than the limits set by the MICROSCOPE equivalence principle test, and an analogous measurement in the MAGIS-100 long-baseline interferometer would be more sensitive than previous bounds by factors of 10 or more. A search for anomalous spin torque in MAGIS-100 is projected to reach similar sensitivity to atomic magnetometry experiments. We discuss strategies for mitigating the main systematic effects in each measurement. These results indicate that improved dark matter searches with Yb atom interferometry are technically feasible.</description>

      <title>Relativistic VQE calculations of molecular electric dipole moments on trapped ion quantum hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is among the most actively studied topics in atomic and molecular calculations on quantum computers, yet few studies address properties other than energies or account for relativistic effects. This work presents high-precision 18-qubit relativistic VQE simulations for calculating the permanent electric dipole moments (PDMs) of BeH to RaH molecules on traditional computers, and 6- and 12-qubit PDM computations for SrH on IonQ quantum devices. To achieve high precision on current noisy intermediate scale era quantum hardware, we apply various resource reduction methods, including Reinforcement Learning and causal flow preserving ZX-Calculus routines, along with error mitigation and post-selection techniques. Our approach reduces the two-qubit gate count in our 12-qubit circuit by 99.71%, with only a 2.35% trade-off in precision for PDM when evaluated classically within a suitably chosen active space. On the current generation IonQ Forte-I hardware, the error in PDM is -1.17% relative to classical calculations and only 1.21% compared to the unoptimized circuit.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and Electron Correlation Effects in Static Dipole Polarizabilities for Main-Group Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, I compute the static dipole polarizability of main-group elements using the finite-field method combined with relativistic coupled-cluster and configuration interaction simulations. The computational results closely align with the values recommended in the 2018 table of static dipole polarizabilities of neutral elements [Mol. Phys. 117, 1200 (2019)]. Additionally, I investigate the influence of relativistic effects and electron correlation on atomic dipole polarizabilities. Specifically, three types of relativistic effects impacting dipole polarizabilities are studied: scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling, and fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb effects. The results indicate that scalar-relativistic effects are predominant for atoms in Groups 1--2, with minimal influence from spin-orbit coupling effects. Conversely, for elements in Groups 13--18, scalar-relativistic effects are less significant, while spin-orbit coupling significantly affects elements starting from the fourth row in Groups 13--14 and from the fifth row in Groups 15--18. In each category of relativistic effects, the impact of electron correlation is evaluated. The results show that electron correlation significantly influences dipole polarizability calculations, particularly for Groups 1--2 and 13--14 atoms, but is less significant for Groups 15--18 atoms. This study provides a comprehensive and consistent dataset of dipole polarizabilities and contributes to a systematic understanding of the roles of relativistic and electron correlation effects in atomic dipole polarizabilities, serving as a valuable reference for future research.</description>

Abstract: Resolving the locations and discriminating the spin states of individual trapped ions with high fidelity is critical for a large class of applications in quantum computing, simulation, and sensing. We report on a method for high-fidelity state discrimination in large two-dimensional (2D) crystals with over 100 trapped ions in a single trapping region, combining a hardware detector and an artificial neural network. A high-data-rate, spatially resolving, single-photon sensitive timestamping detector performs efficient single-shot detection of 2D crystals in a Penning trap, exhibiting rotation at about $25\,\mathrm{kHz}$. We then train an artificial neural network to process the fluorescence photon data in the rest frame of the rotating crystal in order to identify ion locations with a success rate of $~90\%$, accounting for substantial illumination inhomogeneity across the crystal. Finally, employing a time-binned state detection method, we arrive at an average spin-state detection fidelity of $94(2)\%$. This technique can be used to analyze spatial and temporal correlations in arrays of hundreds of trapped-ion qubits.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed</description>

      <title>Radii of Mirror Nuclei and Isobaric Triplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a review of absolute root-mean-square charge radii of stable nuclei up to $Z=32$, which includes a previously overlooked uncertainty in the combined analysis of muonic x-ray and electron scattering experiments. From these \textit{reference radii} and isotope shift measurements, we obtain those of 12 mirror pairs with a traceable and realistic uncertainty budget. The difference in radii between mirror nuclei is found to be proportional to the isospin asymmetry, confirming recent calculations by Novario \emph{et al.} [PRL~130, 032501]. From the fitted proportionality constant and its uncertainty, the radii of 73 previously unknown mirror partners are predicted. These are useful e.g. for benchmarking atomic and nuclear theory, calibrating entire chains, and as an input to nuclear beta-decay calculations. The radii of $(T=1,T_z=0)$ nuclei are interpolated assuming negligible isospin symmetry breaking. This completes a model-independent, high-precision extraction of the charge and weak radii of all nuclei involved in the testing of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.</description>
