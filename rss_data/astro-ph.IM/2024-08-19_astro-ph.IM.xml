      <title>Comparing NASA Discovery and New Frontiers Class Mission Concepts for the Io Volcano Observer (IVO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's moon Io is a highly compelling target for future exploration that offers critical insight into tidal dissipation processes and the geology of high heat flux worlds, including primitive planetary bodies, such as the early Earth, that are shaped by enhanced rates of volcanism. Io is also important for understanding the development of volcanogenic atmospheres and mass-exchange within the Jupiter System. However, fundamental questions remain about the state of Io's interior, surface, and atmosphere, as well as its role in the evolution of the Galilean satellites. The Io Volcano Observer (IVO) would address these questions by achieving the following three key goals: (A) Determine how and where tidal heat is generated inside Io; (B) Understand how tidal heat is transported to the surface of Io; and (C) Understand how Io is evolving. IVO was selected for Phase A study through the NASA Discovery program in 2020 and, in anticipation of a New Frontiers 5 opportunity, an enhanced IVO-NF mission concept was advanced that would increase the Baseline mission from 10 flybys to 20, with an improved radiation design; employ a Ka-band communications to double IVO's total data downlink; add a wide angle camera for color and stereo mapping; add a dust mass spectrometer; and lower the altitude of later flybys to enable new science. This study compares and contrasts the mission architecture, instrument suite, and science objectives for Discovery (IVO) and New Frontiers (IVO-NF) missions to Io, and advocates for continued prioritization of Io as an exploration target for New Frontiers.</description>

      <title>On the full non-Gaussian Surprise statistic and the cosmological concordance between DESI, SDSS and Pantheon+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing precision of recent cosmological surveys and the discovery of important tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, it is becoming more and more important to develop tools to quantify accurately the discordance between different probes. One such tool is the Surprise statistic, a measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The Surprise, however, has been up to now applied only under its Gaussian approximation, which can fail to properly capture discordance in cases that deviate significantly from Gaussianity. In this paper we developed the klsurprise code which computes the full numerical non-Gaussian Surprise, and analyse the Surprise for BAO + BBN and supernova data. We test different cosmological models, some of which the parameters deviate significantly from Gaussianity. We find that the non-Gaussianities, mainly present in the Supernova dataset, change the Surprise statistic significantly from its Gaussian approximation, and reveal a $2.7\sigma$ tension in the curved $w$CDM model (o$w$CDM) between the combined Pantheon+ and SH0ES (Pantheon+ &amp; SH0ES) data and the dataset which combines SDSS, BOSS and eBOSS BAO. This tension is hidden in the Gaussian Surprise approximation. For DESI the tension with Pantheon+ &amp; SH0ES is at the meager $1.9\sigma$ level for o$w$CDM, but a large $3.3\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Events in Neutrino Telescopes through Deep Learning-Driven Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries by neutrino telescopes, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, relied extensively on machine learning (ML) tools to infer physical quantities from the raw photon hits detected. Neutrino telescope reconstruction algorithms are limited by the sparse sampling of photons by the optical modules due to the relatively large spacing ($10-100\,{\rm m})$ between them. In this letter, we propose a novel technique that learns photon transport through the detector medium through the use of deep learning-driven super-resolution of data events. These ``improved'' events can then be reconstructed using traditional or ML techniques, resulting in improved resolution. Our strategy arranges additional ``virtual'' optical modules within an existing detector geometry and trains a convolutional neural network to predict the hits on these virtual optical modules. We show that this technique improves the angular reconstruction of muons in a generic ice-based neutrino telescope. Our results readily extend to water-based neutrino telescopes and other event morphologies.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning LLMs for Autonomous Spacecraft Control: A Case Study Using Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text prompt. This study explores the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for autonomous spacecraft control, using the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games suite (KSPDG) as a testing environment. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches face limitations in this domain due to insufficient simulation capabilities and data. By leveraging LLMs, specifically fine-tuning models like GPT-3.5 and LLaMA, we demonstrate how these models can effectively control spacecraft using language-based inputs and outputs. Our approach integrates real-time mission telemetry into textual prompts processed by the LLM, which then generate control actions via an agent. The results open a discussion about the potential of LLMs for space operations beyond their nominal use for text-related tasks. Future work aims to expand this methodology to other space control tasks and evaluate the performance of different LLM families. The code is available at this URL: \texttt{https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/kspdg}.</description>

      <title>The unusual events in X-ray emulsion chamber experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article considers events recorded in an experiment with X-ray emulsion chambers (XREC) to study the trunks of extensive air showers (EAS) with energies of nuclei of primary cosmic radiation (PCR) E0 &gt; 100 TeV, which currently have no explanation within the standard model of nuclear interactions (SM). The XREC method is the only one that allows studying EAS trunks with a high coordinate resolution of about 100 microns. EAS trunks contain the most complete information about primary acts of nuclear interactions, as a result of which all unusual events recorded by the XREC method are of great scientific interest. Several types of unusual events recorded by the XREC method were explained within the SM.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Giant Impact Simulations with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraining planet formation models based on the observed exoplanet population requires generating large samples of synthetic planetary systems, which can be computationally prohibitive. A significant bottleneck is simulating the giant impact phase, during which planetary embryos evolve gravitationally and combine to form planets, which may themselves experience later collisions. To accelerate giant impact simulations, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predicting collisional outcomes in multiplanet systems. Trained on more than 500,000 $N$-body simulations of three-planet systems, we develop an ML model that can accurately predict which two planets will experience a collision, along with the state of the post-collision planets, from a short integration of the system's initial conditions. Our model greatly improves on non-ML baselines that rely on metrics from dynamics theory, which struggle to accurately predict which pair of planets will experience a collision. By combining with a model for predicting long-term stability, we create an efficient ML-based giant impact emulator, which can predict the outcomes of giant impact simulations with a speedup of up to four orders of magnitude. We expect our model to enable analyses that would not otherwise be computationally feasible. As such, we release our full training code, along with an easy-to-use API for our collision outcome model and giant impact emulator.</description>

Abstract: We present here the current state of a collection of promising ultraviolet technologies in preparation for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Working with experts representing a significant number of groups working in the ultraviolet, we summarize some of the leading science drivers, present an argument for a 100 nm blue wavelength cutoff, and gather current state of the art of UV technologies. We present the state of the art of contamination control, a crucial piece of the UV instrument plan. We explore next steps with individual technologies, as well as present paths forward with systems level testing and development.</description>

      <title>YOUNG Star detrending for Transiting Exoplanet Recovery (YOUNGSTER) -- I. A search for young exoplanets in Sectors 1-5 of the TESS Full-Frame-Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.01721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young (&lt;1Gyr) exoplanets represent a critically important area of exoplanet research, as they offer the opportunity to learn about the formation and early dynamic history of exoplanetary systems. However, finding young exoplanets is significantly complicated by the fast rotation and complex activity of their young host stars, which are often not well handled by state-of-the-art automatic pipelines. This work presents an alternative LOWESS-based pipeline focused specifically on detrending young stellar light-curves from the 30min-cadence Full Frame Images (FFIs) produced by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ($TESS$), and includes improvements such as automatic peak-cutting of stellar variability and interpolation over masked transits to improve periodogram visibility and returned transit shapes. This work presents the details of the developed pipeline, along with initial results from its application to young stars within stellar associations in sectors 1-5 of the $TESS$ data. While no new exoplanet candidate signals were found in this work, interesting results included the recovery of all known 2min TOIs around young stars in sectors 1-5 from 30min data alone, the recovery of the young exoplanet DS Tuc Ab, a number of young eclipsing binaries and a wide array of interesting rotation. A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken for each star, showing how recovery of injected planets varied with both depth and period for each individual target. Challenges for future searches for young exoplanets are discussed, the largest being stellar rotation with periods less than 1 day and a lack of a large sample of confirmed young stars.</description>

      <title>TRACE: a Time-Reversible Algorithm for Close Encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TRACE, an almost time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed timestep symplectic method such the Wisdom--Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez &amp; Dehnen. In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 12x speedup. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 15x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 41x speedup. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.</description>
