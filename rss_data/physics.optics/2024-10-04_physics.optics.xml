      <title>Recording dynamic facial micro-expressions with a multi-focus camera array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach of utilizing a multi-camera array system for capturing dynamic high-resolution videos of the human face, with improved imaging performance as compared to traditional single-camera configurations. Employing an array of 54 individual high-resolution cameras, each with its own 13 megapixel sensor (709 megapixels total), we uniquely focus each camera to a different plane across the curved surface of the human face in order to capture dynamic facial expressions. Post-processing methods then stitch together each synchronized set of 54 images into a composite video frame. Our multi-focus strategy overcomes the resolution and depth-of-field (DOF) limitations for capturing macroscopically curved surfaces such as the human face, while maintaining high lateral resolution. Specifically we demonstrate how our setup achieves a generally uniform lateral resolution of 26.75 +/- 8.8 micrometer across a composite DOF of ~43mm that covers the entire face (85 cm^2 + FOV). Compared to a single-focus configuration this is almost a 10-fold increase in effective DOF. We believe that our new approach for multi-focus camera array video sets the stage for future video capture of a variety of dynamic and macroscopically curved surfaces at microscopic resolution.</description>

      <title>Exploring the equivalence of causality-based and quantum mechanics-based sum rules for harmonic generation in nonlinear optical materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kramers-Kronig relations and various oscillator strength sum rules represent strong constraints on the physical response of materials. In this work, taking inspiration from the well-established equivalence between $f-$sum rules and Thomas--Reiche--Kuhn sum rules in linear optics, we explore the connection between causality-based and quantum-mechanics-based sum rules in the context of nonlinear optical processes. Specifically, by considering the sum-over-states expression for the second harmonic generation susceptibility, we deduce a new representation basis for the imaginary part of this susceptibility and we use it to derive, from causality-based integral sum rules, a new set of discrete sum rules that the transition dipole moments must satisfy. As in the case of the Thomas--Reiche--Kuhn sum rules, we also show that these results can alternatively be derived through an independent quantum mechanical analysis. Finally, we consider the implications of the derived sum rules for the second-harmonic-generation susceptibility of two- and three-level systems and, more broadly, we discuss the possible significance and challenges of using these results for the goal of identifying fundamental limits to the response of nonlinear optical materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusive interactions between photons and electrons: an application to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient force is the conservative component of many types of forces exerted by light on particles. When it is derived from a potential, there is no heat transferred to the particle interacting with the light field. However, most theoretical descriptions of the gradient force use simplified configurations of the light field and particle interactions which overlook small amounts of heating. It is known that quantum fluctuations contribute to a very small but measurable momentum diffusion of atoms and a corresponding increase in their temperature. This paper examines the contribution to momentum diffusion from a gradient force described as a quantum interaction between electron wave packets and a classical electromagnetic field. Stimulated transfers of photons between interfering light beams produce a small amount of heating that is difficult to detect in laboratory experiments. However the solar corona, with its thermal electrons irradiated by an intense electromagnetic field, provides ideal conditions for such a measurement. Heating from stimulated transfers is calculated to contribute a large fraction of the observed coronal heating. Furthermore, the energy removed from the light field produces a wavelength shift of its spectrum as it travels through free electrons. Theory predicts a stimulated transfer redshift comparable to the redshift of distant objects observed in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentz reciprocity is a fundamental property in electromagnetism and well known to break down due to an external magnetic field. With a fictitious or imaginary vector potential, however, its behavior is largely unknown. Here we show that in systems with an imaginary vector potential and displaying the non-Hermitian skin effect, the Lorentz reciprocity is broken but still governed by a rigorous mathematical relation, which we term non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity. When mimicking an imaginary vector potential using just linear integrated photonic elements, however, the conditions that lead to the Lorentz reciprocity are still satisfied and hence the latter cannot be broken. Nevertheless, we show that the non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity can still be observed with a proper choice of inputs and outputs, alongside the Lorentz reciprocity. In addition, we also reveal another equal-amplitude response in the same system, which we attribute to a non-Hermitian gauged symmetry. Furthermore, we show that light propagation is not impinged by the non-Hermitian topological funnel effect, highlighting an underappreciated difference between coherently driven and non-driven systems. These findings are confirmed using a tight-binding model and full-wave simulations of coupled optical micro-ring resonators, providing a valuable extension of the Lorentz reciprocity in the non-Hermitian domain.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Co-Simulation in High-Speed Silicon Photonics Transceiver Design Using Standard Electronic Circuit Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-speed optical interconnects necessitates integrated photonic and electronic solutions. Electro-optic co-simulation is key to meeting these requirements, which works by importing interoperable photonic models into industry-standard electronic circuit simulators from Synopsys, Cadence, Keysight, and others. However, current interoperable photonic models cannot accurately predict performance and do not address terabit-class transceiver designs due to inadequate modeling of complex physical effects such as optical losses, back-reflection, nonlinearity, high-frequency response, noise, and manufacturing variations. Here, we present accurate and interoperable photonic models that agree well with experiments at symbol rates exceeding 50 Gbaud. The developed models include basic optical components with losses and reflections, two types of Mach-Zehnder modulators with validated high-frequency response, and testing equipment with associated noise. We built an optical link testbench on an industry-standard electronic circuit simulator and verified the model accuracy by comparing simulation and experiment up to 64 Gbaud. The results suggest that co-simulation will be a solid basis for advancing design of transceivers and other related applications in silicon photonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin BIC metasurfaces based on ultralow-loss Sb2Se3 phase-change material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) are increasingly recognised as promising platforms for tunable photonic devices due to their ability to modulate optical properties through solid-state phase transitions. Ultrathin and low-loss PCMs are highly valued for their fast and more effective phase transitions and applications in reconfigurable photonic chips, metasurfaces, optical modulators, sensors, photonic memories, and neuromorphic computing. However, conventional PCMs such as GST, GSST, VO2, and In3SbTe2, despite optimisation for tunable meta-optics, suffer from high intrinsic losses in the near-infrared (NIR) region, limiting their potential for high quality factor (Q-factor) resonant metasurfaces. Here we present the design and fabrication of tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces using the ultralow-loss PCM Sb2Se3. Our BIC metasurfaces, only 25 nm thick, achieve high modulation depth and broad resonance tuning in the NIR with high Q-factors up to 130, without the need for additional materials. Experimentally, we employ these BIC metasurfaces to modulate photoluminescence in rare earth-doped upconversion nanoparticles, reducing the excitation power for multiphoton photoluminescence and enabling emission polarisation manipulation. This work offers a promising platform for developing active resonant metasurfaces in the NIR region, with broad applications including super resolution imaging, optical modulation, ultrafast switches, harmonic generation, colour filtering, and optical sensing.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Generation and Detection of Coherent Acoustic Vibrations in Single Gallium Phosphide Nanoantennas Probed Near the Anapole Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanostructured high-index dielectrics have shown great promise as low-loss photonic platforms for wavefront control and enhancing optical nonlinearities. However, their potential as optomechanical resonators has remained unexplored. In this work, we investigate the generation and detection of coherent acoustic phonons in individual crystalline gallium phosphide nanodisks on silica in a pump-probe configuration. By pumping the dielectric above its bandgap energy and probing over its transparent region, we observe the radial breathing mode of the disk with an oscillation frequency around 10 GHz. We analyze the performance of nanoantennas of various sizes in the 300-600 nm diameter range at fixed 125 nm height and find that the detection efficiency is maximum near the fundamental anapole state, in agreement with numerical simulations. By comparing with reference gold nanodisk and nanorod plasmonic resonators, we find that the dielectric nanoantennas display a modulation amplitude up to ~5 times larger. We further demonstrate the launching of acoustic waves through the underlaying substrate and the mechanical coupling between two nanostructures placed 3 {\mu}m apart, laying the basis for photonic-phononic signal processing using dielectric nanoantennas.</description>

      <title>CUDA-based optical parametric oscillator simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled-wave equations (CWEs) in nonlinear optics are the fundamental starting point in the study, analysis, and understanding of various frequency conversion processes in dielectric media subjected to intense laser radiation. In this work, a useful package for the modeling of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) based on the Split-Step Fourier Method algorithm is presented. The algorithm is scripted in the CUDA programming language in order to speed up the calculations and obtain results in a relatively short time frame by using a graphics processing unit (GPU). Our results show a speedup higher than 50X for vector size of $2^{14}$ in comparison with the analogous code scripted for running only in CPU. The package implements the CWEs to model the propagation of light in second-order nonlinear crystals widely used in optical frequency conversion experiments. In addition, the code allows the user to adapt the cavity configuration by selecting the resonant electric fields and/or incorporating intracavity elements. The package is useful for modeling OPOs or other mathematically similar problems.</description>

      <title>Prospects of phase-adaptive cooling of levitated magnetic particles in a hollow-core photonic-crystal fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the feasibility of cooling of classical motion of a micro- to nano-sized magnetic particle, levitated inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The cooling action is implemented by means of controlling the phase of one of the counter-propagating fiber guided waves. Direct imaging of the particle's position, followed by the subsequent updating of the control laser's phase leads to Stokes type of cooling force. We provide estimates of cooling efficiency and final achievable temperature, taking into account thermal and detection noise sources. Our results bring forward an important step towards using trapped micro-magnets in sensing, testing the fundamental physics and preparing the quantum states of magnetization.</description>

Abstract: This work provides a mathematical derivation of a quasi-stationary model for multimode parametric down-conversion, which was presented in [Gatti et al., Sci. Rep. 13, 16786] with heuristic arguments. The model is here derived from the 3D+1 propagation equation of the quantum fields in a nonlinear crystal, and its approximations discussed thoroughly. Thanks to its relative simplicity, and to the fact that it is valid in any gain regime, both at a quantum and classical level, it allows a unified description of disparate experimental observations conducted over the last 20 years, often described in the past by means of limited ad hoc models.</description>

      <title>Universal Logical Quantum Photonic Neural Network Processor via Cavity-Assisted Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information within bosonic modes offers a promising direction for hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, achieving high-fidelity universal control over the bosonic degree of freedom using native photonic hardware remains a challenge. Here, we propose an architecture to prepare and perform logical quantum operations on arbitrary multimode multi-photon states using a quantum photonic neural network. Central to our approach is the optical nonlinearity, which is realized through strong light-matter interaction with a three-level Lambda atomic system. The dynamics of this interaction are confined to the single-mode subspace, enabling the construction of high-fidelity quantum gates. This nonlinearity functions as a photon-number selective phase gate, which facilitates the construction of a universal gate set and serves as the element-wise activation function in our neural network architecture. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by executing tasks that are key to logical quantum information processing. The network is able to deterministically prepare a wide array of multimode multi-photon states, including essential resource states. We also show that the architecture is capable of encoding and performing logical operations on bosonic error-correcting codes. Additionally, by adapting components of our architecture, error-correcting circuits can be built to protect bosonic codes. The proposed architecture paves the way for near-term quantum photonic processors that enable error-corrected quantum computation, and can be achieved using present-day integrated photonic hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random walk of photons in a tight-binding lattice is known to exhibit diffusive motion similar to classical random walks under decoherence, clearly illustrating the quantum-to-classical transition. In this study, we reveal that the random walk of intense classical light under dephasing dynamics can disentangle quantum and ensemble averaging, making it possible to observe a subdiffusive walker dynamics, i.e. a behavior very distinct from both a classical and a quantum walker. These findings are demonstrated through proposing photonic random walks in synthetic temporal lattices, based on pulse dynamics in coupled fiber loops.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous photon and phonon lasing in a two-tone driven optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving simultaneous lasing of photons and phonons in optomechanical setups has great potential for applications in quantum information processing, high precision sensing and the design of hybrid photonic-phononic devices. Here, we explore this possibility with an optomechanical system driven by a two-tone field. Whenever the difference between the driving frequencies matches the associated mechanical frequency, the photon and phonon populations are found to achieve steady-state coherent oscillations, demonstrating a dual lasing phenomenon. Such drive-tone resonance condition can synchronize the phases of the photon and phonon fields, which facilitates a robust simultaneous lasing. Here, we provide analytical insights into the joint amplification of the optical and mechanical modes, and further confirm the dual lasing phenomenon by numerically calculating the relevant correlation functions and the power spectrum. Our setup, consisting of a single optomechanical cavity, is simpler than previous realizations of dual lasing and provides a clean picture of the underlying mechanisms. Our work thus paves the way for the development of novel strategies for the optimisation of optomechanical interactions through tailored driving schemes.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for deriving limits on Raman scattering in structured media and exploit it to constrain the maximum Raman signal resulting from a planewave incident on either a single Raman molecule in the vicinity of a structured medium or a designable Raman medium. Results pertaining to metallic and dielectric structures illustrate the importance of accounting for the nonlinear interplay between pump and signal fields, showing that treating the pump-focusing and signal-extraction processes separately, as in prior work, leads to unrealistic enhancements. The formulation could readily find applications in further enhancing surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy and Raman-assisted lasing.</description>

      <title>GHz-rate optical phase shift in light matter interaction-engineered, silicon-ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic electro-optic materials have demonstrated promising performance in developing electro-optic phase shifters. Their integration with other silicon photonic processes, nanofabrication complexities, and durability remain to be developed. While the required poling step in electro-optic polymers limits their potential and utilization on a large scale, devices made of paraelectric nematic liquid crystals suffer from slow bandwidth. In ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, we report an additional GHz-fast phase shift that ultimately allows for significant second-order nonlinear optical coefficients and the related Pockels effect. It avoids poling issues and can pave the way for hybrid silicon-organic systems with CMOS-foundry compatibility. We report DC and AC modulation efficiencies of $\approx$0.25 V$\cdot$mm and $\approx$25.7 V$\cdot$mm, respectively, an on-chip insertion loss of $\approx$2.1 dB, and an electro-optic bandwidth of $f_{-6dB}$&gt;4.18 GHz, employing improved light-matter interaction in a waveguide architecture that calls for only one lithography step.</description>

      <title>Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines</title>

Abstract: Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</description>

      <title>Anchor-Controlled Generative Adversarial Network for High-Fidelity Electromagnetic and Structurally Diverse Metasurface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, capable of manipulating light at subwavelength scales, hold great potential for advancing optoelectronic applications. Generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), offer a promising approach for metasurface inverse design by efficiently navigating complex design spaces and capturing underlying data patterns. However, existing generative models struggle to achieve high electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity. These challenges arise from the lack of explicit electromagnetic constraints during training, which hinders accurate structure-to-electromagnetic response mapping, and the absence of mechanisms to handle one-to-many mappings dilemma, resulting in insufficient structural diversity. To address these issues, we propose the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), a novel framework that improves both electromagnetic fidelity and structural diversity. To achieve high electromagnetic fidelity, AcGAN proposes the Spectral Overlap Coefficient (SOC) for precise spectral fidelity assessment and develops AnchorNet, which provides real-time feedback on electromagnetic performance to refine the structure-to-electromagnetic mapping. To enhance structural diversity, AcGAN incorporates a cluster-guided controller that refines input processing and ensures multi-level spectral integration, guiding the generation process to explore multiple configurations for the same spectral target. Additionally, a dynamic loss function progressively shifts the focus from data-driven learning to optimizing both spectral fidelity and structural diversity. Empirical analysis shows that AcGAN reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 73% compared to current state-of-the-art GANs methods and significantly expands the design space to generate diverse metasurface architectures that meet precise spectral demands.</description>

      <title>Stable-to-unstable transition in quantum friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>
