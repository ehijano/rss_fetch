      <title>Context-Aware Language Models for Forecasting Market Impact from Sequences of Financial News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial news plays a critical role in the information diffusion process in financial markets and is a known driver of stock prices. However, the information in each news article is not necessarily self-contained, often requiring a broader understanding of the historical news coverage for accurate interpretation. Further, identifying and incorporating the most relevant contextual information presents significant challenges. In this work, we explore the value of historical context in the ability of large language models to understand the market impact of financial news. We find that historical context provides a consistent and significant improvement in performance across methods and time horizons. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective contextualization method that uses a large LM to process the main article, while a small LM encodes the historical context into concise summary embeddings that are then aligned with the large model's representation space. We explore the behavior of the model through multiple qualitative and quantitative interpretability tests and reveal insights into the value of contextualization. Finally, we demonstrate that the value of historical context in model predictions has real-world applications, translating to substantial improvements in simulated investment performance.</description>
