      <title>Observe novel tricritical phenomena in self-organized Fermi gas induced by higher order Fermi surface nesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Observation of \sigma-\pi coupling and mode selection in optically trapped artificial polariton molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microcavity exciton-polariton condensates under additional transverse confinement constitute a flexible optical platform to study the coupling mechanism between confined nonequilibrium and nonlinear states of matter. Driven far from equilibrium, polariton condensates can display spontaneous synchronization and instabilities depending on excitation and material parameters, showcasing emergent and intricate interference patterns based on mode competition over mutual gain landscapes. Here, we explore this coupling mechanism between polariton condensates populating the first excited ${\it p}$-state manifold of coupled optically trapped condensates and show a rich structure of patterns based on excitation parameters. The optical reconfigurability of the laser excitation patterns enables the creation of an annular-shaped beam to confine polaritons in a tailored trapping potential, whilst the dissipative nature of the optical traps enables effective interaction with neighboring condensates. Our results underpin the potential role of polariton condensates in exploring and simulating $\sigma$ and $\pi$ molecular bonding mechanisms between artificial two-dimensional diatomic orbitals and beyond.</description>

      <title>On Random Displacements in Critical Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays promise high-fidelity quantum simulations of critical phenomena with flexible geometries. Yet experimental realizations inevitably suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a novel pseudo-criticality emerges in mesoscopic Rydberg chains, and show that the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity effect and scale-dependent viscosity in atomic quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron gases are predicted to possess an anomalous ''tomographic'' transport regime that is marked by an odd-even effect in the relaxation times, with odd-parity deformations of the Fermi surface becoming long-lived in comparison to even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that neutral two-component atomic Fermi gases also exhibit this tomographic effect. By diagonalizing the Fermi liquid collision integral, we identify odd-parity modes with anomalously long lifetimes below temperatures $T\leq 0.15T_F$, which is within reach of cold atom experiments. Furthermore, in contrast to electron gases, we find that the odd-even effect in neutral gases is widely tuneable with interactions along the BCS-BEC crossover and is suppressed on the BEC side. We propose as an experimental signature of the odd-even effect the damping rate of quadrupole oscillations, which is anomalously enhanced due to the presence of long-lived odd-parity modes. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of two-dimensional Fermi gases is richer than previously thought and should include additional long-lived modes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhancement of Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium properties of many-body systems with a large number of degrees of freedom are generally expected to be described by statistical mechanics. Such expectations are closely tied to the observation of thermalization, as manifested through equipartition in time-dependent observables, which takes place both in quantum and classical systems but may look very different in comparison. By studying the dynamics of individual lattice site populations in ultracold bosonic gases, we show that the process of relaxation toward equilibrium in a quantum system can be orders of magnitude faster than in its classical counterpart. Classical chaos quantifiers reveal that this is due to a wave packet in a quantum system being able to escape regions of inefficient classical transport by a mechanism akin to tunneling. Since the presented phenomenon takes place in a broad parameter range and persists in weakly disordered systems, we expect that it occurs in a variety of many-body systems and is amenable to direct experimental verification in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz and immiscible to miscible quenching instabilities in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible to miscible quenching transition (IMQT), under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex productions and sound-wave (phonon) propagations. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number $k$. The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$, for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals. Deviating from the classical scaling, a kind of ``Bottleneck effect" is noticed in the IMQT spectra.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Topological-Paired Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and robust protocol for quantum-enhanced sensing using a single qubit in the topological waveguide system. Our method relies on the topological-paired bound states, which are localized near the qubit and can be effectively regarded as a two-level system. Through the lens of Bayesian inference theory, we show that the sensitivity can reach the Heisenberg limit across a large field range. Inheriting from the topological robustness of the waveguide, our sensing protocol is robust against local perturbations. Besides, our sensing protocol utilizes a product state as the initial state, which can be easily prepared in experiments. We expect this approach would pave the way toward robust topological quantum sensors based on near-term quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits and Rydberg arrays.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate that the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation is largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach towards the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating the weight $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.</description>
