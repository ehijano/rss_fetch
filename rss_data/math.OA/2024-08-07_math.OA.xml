      <title>Criteria for the existence of Schwartz Gabor frames over rational lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit criterion for a rational lattice in the time-frequency plane to admit a Gabor frame with window in the Schwartz class. The criterion is an inequality formulated in terms of the lattice covolume, the dimension of the underlying Euclidean space, and the index of an associated subgroup measuring the degree of non-integrality of the lattice. For arbitrary lattices we also give an upper bound on the number of windows in the Schwartz class needed for a multi-window Gabor frame.</description>

      <title>A theory of locally convex Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the completed inductive, projective and injective tensor products of Grothendieck for locally convex topological vector spaces, we develop a systematic theory of locally convex Hopf algebras with an emphasis on Pontryagin-type dualities. We describe how classical Hopf algebras, real and complex Lie groups, as well as compact and discrete quantum groups, can all give rise to natural examples of this theory in a variety of different ways. We also show that the space of all continuous functions on a topological group $ G $ whose topological structures are compactly generated has an $ \varepsilon $-Hopf algebra structure, and we can recover $ G $ fully as a topological group from this locally convex Hopf algebra. The latter is done via a generalization of Gelfand duality, which is of its own interest. Certain projective and inductive limits are also considered in this framework, and it is shown that how this can lead to examples seemingly outside of the framework of locally compact quantum groups in the sense of Kustermans-Vaes. As an illustration, we propose a version of the infinite quantum permutation group $ S^{+}_{\infty} $, the free orthogonal group $ O^{+}_{\infty} $, and the free unitary group $ U^{+}_{\infty} $ as certain strict inductive limits, all of which still retain a nice duality. Combined with our duality theory, this may be seen as an alternative tentative approach to the Kac program of developing a Pontryagin-type duality to a wider class, while at the same time, we include many more interesting examples of classical and quantum groups.</description>

      <title>Rigidity on Quantum Symmetry for a Certain Class of Graph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum symmetry of graph $C^{*}$-algebras has been studied, under the consideration of different formulations, in the past few years. It is already known that the compact quantum group $(\underbrace{C(S^{1})*C(S^{1})*\cdots *C(S^{1})}_{|E(\Gamma)|-times}, \Delta) $ always acts on a graph $C^*$-algebra for a finite, connected, directed graph $\Gamma$ in the category introduced by Joardar and Mandal, where $|E(\Gamma)|:=$ number of edges in $\Gamma$. In this article, we show that for a certain class of graphs including Toeplitz algebra, quantum odd sphere, matrix algebra etc. the quantum symmetry of their associated graph $C^*$-algebras remains $(\underbrace{C(S^{1})*C(S^{1})*\cdots *C(S^{1})}_{|E(\Gamma)|-times}, \Delta) $ in the category as mentioned before. More precisely, if a finite, connected, directed graph $\Gamma$ satisfies the following graph theoretic properties : (i) there does not exist any cycle of length $\geq$ 2 (ii) there exists a path of length $(|V(\Gamma)|-1)$ which consists all the vertices, where $|V(\Gamma)|:=$ number of vertices in $\Gamma$ (iii) given any two vertices (may not be distinct) there exists at most one edge joining them, then the universal object coincides with $(\underbrace{C(S^{1})*C(S^{1})*\cdots *C(S^{1})}_{|E(\Gamma)|-times}, \Delta) $. Furthermore, we have pointed out a few counter examples whenever the above assumptions are violated.</description>

      <title>GNS-construction for positive C*-valued sesquilinear maps on a quasi *-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GNS construction for positive invariant sesquilinear forms on quasi *-algebras is generalized to a class of positive C*-valued sesquilinear maps on quasi *-algebras. The result is a *-representation taking values in a space of operators acting on a certain quasi-normed C-module.</description>

      <title>A Novel Generalisation of Supersymmetry: Quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-Oscillators and their `superisation'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a very simple toy model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-supersymmetric quantum system and show, via Klein's construction, how to understand the system as being an $N=2$ supersymmetric system with an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading. That is, the commutation/anticommutation rules are defined via the standard boson/fermion rules, but the system still has an underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading that needs to be taken into account.</description>
