      <title>Commissioning of a radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for collinear laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2{\mu}s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of RFQ cooler-buncher system has significantly improved the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>

      <title>Hadron Identification Prospects With Granular Calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of determining the identity of hadrons at high energies based on the topology of their energy depositions in dense matter, along with the time of the interactions. Using GEANT4 simulations of a homogeneous lead tungstate calorimeter with high transverse and longitudinal segmentation, we investigated the discrimination of protons, positive pions, and positive kaons at 100 GeV. The analysis focuses on the impact of calorimeter granularity by progressively merging detector cells and extracting features like energy deposition patterns andtiming information. Two machine learning approaches, XGBoost and fully connected deep neural networks, were employed to assess the classification performance across particle pairs. The results indicate that fine segmentation improves particle discrimination, with higher granularity yielding more detailed characterization of energy showers. Additionally, the results highlight the importance of shower radius, energy fractions, and timing variables in distinguishing particle types. The XGBoost model demonstrated computational efficiency and interpretability advantages over deep learning for tabular data structures, while achieving similar classification performance. This motivates further work required to combine high- and low-level feature analysis, e.g., using convolutional and graph-based neural networks, and extending the study to a broader range of particle energies and types.</description>

      <title>Performance Characteristics of the Battery-Operated Si PIN Diode Detector with Integrated Preamplifier and Data Acquisition Module for Fusion Particle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the performance and application of a commercial off-the shelf Si PIN diode (Hamamatsu S14605) as a charged particle detector in a compact ion beam system (IBS) capable of generating D-D and p-B fusion charged particles. This detector is inexpensive, widely available, and operates in photoconductive mode under a reverse bias voltage of 12 V, supplied by an A23 battery. A charge-sensitive preamplifier (CSP) is powered by two 3 V lithium batteries (A123), providing +/-3 V rail voltages. Both the detector and preamplifier circuits are integrated onto the same 4-layer PCB and housed on the vacuum side of the IBS, facing the fusion target. The system employs a CF-2.75 flanged DB-9 connector feedthrough to supply the signal, bias voltage, and rail voltages. To mitigate the high sensitivity of the detector to optical light, a thin aluminum foil assembly is used to block optical emissions from the ion beam and target. Charged particles generate step responses on the preamplifier output, with pulse rise times on the order of 0.2 to 0.3 us. These signals are recorded using a custom-built data acquisition unit, which features an optical fiber data link to ensure electrical isolation of the detector electronics. Subsequent digital signal processing is employed to optimally shape the pulses using a CR-RC^4 filter to produce Gaussian-shaped signals, enabling accurate extraction of energy information. Performance results show that the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for D-D fusion charged particles - protons, tritons, and helions - are approximately 30, 10, and 5, respectively, with a shaping time constant of 4 us.</description>

      <title>Development of Fast Front-End Electronics for the Muon Trigger Detector in the PSI muEDM Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines the design and development of a fast front-end electronic readout board for the muon trigger detector in the muEDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The trigger detector, which consists of a gate and aperture detector, is strategically located at the end of the superconducting injection channel to generate trigger signals for a magnetic kicker, which activates upon the injection of muons into the central region of the storage solenoid. Within the magnetic field of the solenoid, the system configuration is optimized to meet stringent performance specifications, including minimal signal propagation delays, high detection efficiency, non-magnetic properties, and consistent operational stability under varying experimental conditions. Additionally, the design incorporates robust methods for rejecting positron contamination in the muon beamline. The results presented include performance evaluations from both bench testing and actual beam tests, highlighting the effectiveness and reliability of the electronic design.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a high-efficiency muon veto system for the GeSparK alpha-beta/gamma coincidence detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main background sources of low background high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors is the cosmic muon showers produced in the interaction with the lead and copper shield surrounding the detector that can induce signals not distinguishable from radioactivity events. Plastic scintillators are widely used to implement active veto systems to reduce this contribution and increase the measurement sensitivity. In this work, we present the implementation of a high-efficiency muon veto system for the alpha-beta/gamma coincidence detector, called GeSparK. The veto system consists of six plastic scintillator detectors accurately positioned around the HPGe and liquid scintillator detectors. The final design includes two detectors above and four inside the passive shielding between the copper and lead layers. In this way, we could limit both their size and the event rate produced by external radioactivity. A dedicated background measurement showed that the achieved background reduction is a bit less than 93%.</description>

      <title>Searches for light Dark Matter with Spherical Proportional Counters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the nature of dark matter is a key priority that would involve discovering new fundamental physics and is essential for understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. Despite the decades-long ever-more-sensitive searches, the particle content of dark matter remains elusive. Direct searches for dark matter candidates, to-date, focused mainly on candidates in the 10 GeV to 1 TeV, however, more recently lighter candidates with sub-GeV mass have been brought to the spotlight. This is an experimentally challenging mass region, which remains largely uncharted. The spherical proportional counter is a new type of gaseous detector which exhibits several features that make it ideally suited for the exploration of this mass range. In this article the invention and development of the spherical proportional counter are presented, its applications in the search for particle dark matter and beyond are reviewed, and possible future directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</description>

      <title>Readout Optimization of Multi-Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Devices for Single-Quantum Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-destructive readout capability of the Skipper Charge Coupled Device (CCD) has been demonstrated to reduce the noise limitation of conventional silicon devices to levels that allow single-photon or single-electron counting. The noise reduction is achieved by taking multiple measurements of the charge in each pixel. These multiple measurements come at the cost of extra readout time, which has been a limitation for the broader adoption of this technology in particle physics, quantum imaging, and astronomy applications. This work presents recent results of a novel sensor architecture that uses multiple non-destructive floating-gate amplifiers in series to achieve sub-electron readout noise in a thick, fully-depleted silicon detector to overcome the readout time overhead of the Skipper-CCD. This sensor is called the Multiple-Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Device (MAS-CCD) can perform multiple independent charge measurements with each amplifier, and the measurements from multiple amplifiers can be combined to further reduce the readout noise. We will show results obtained for sensors with 8 and 16 amplifiers per readout stage in new readout operations modes to optimize its readout speed. The noise reduction capability of the new techniques will be demonstrated in terms of its ability to reduce the noise by combining the information from the different amplifiers, and to resolve signals in the order of a single photon per pixel. The first readout operation explored here avoids the extra readout time needed in the MAS-CCD to read a line of the sensor associated with the extra extent of the serial register. The second technique explore the capability of the MAS-CCD device to perform a region of interest readout increasing the number of multiple samples per amplifier in a targeted region of the active area of the device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of calibrating a polarimetric back-scattering setup with a beamsplitter, taking into account its optical properties. We justify, via Fisher information, a special calibration configuration of reference optical elements for the maximum likelihood method and demonstrate its effectiveness numerically through Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we highlight the importance of considering the beamsplitter's optical properties by proposing a test to estimate the error resulting from neglecting these properties during the calibration procedure.</description>

      <title>Imaging current flow and injection in scalable graphene devices through NV-magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global electronic properties of solid-state devices are strongly affected by the microscopic spatial paths of charge carriers. Visualising these paths in novel devices produced by scalable processes would provide a quality assessment method that can propel the device performance metrics towards commercial use. Here, we use high-resolution nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry to visualise the charge flow in gold-contacted, single-layer graphene devices produced by scalable methods. Modulating the majority carrier type via field effect reveals a strong asymmetry between the spatial current distributions in the electron and hole regimes that we attribute to an inhomogeneous microscopic potential landscape, inaccessible to conventional measurement techniques. In addition, we observe large, unexpected, differences in charge flow through nominally identical gold-graphene contacts. Moreover, we find that the current transfer into the graphene occurs several microns before the metal contact edge. Our findings establish high-resolution NV-magnetometry as a key tool for characterizing scalable 2D material based devices, uncovering quality deficits of the material, substrate, and electrical contacts that are invisible to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>X-ray Microscopy and Talbot Imaging with the Matter in Extreme Conditions X-ray Imager at LCLS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01551v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has shown the great potential that X-ray Free Electron Lasers (FEL) have to study High Energy Density (HED) physics. Experiments at FELs have made significant breakthroughs in Shock Physics and Dynamic Diffraction, Dense Plasma Physics and Warm Dense Matter Science, using techniques such as isochoric heating, inelastic scattering, small angle scattering and X-ray diffraction. In addition, and complementary to these techniques, the coherent properties of the FEL beam can be used to image HED samples with high fidelity. We present new imaging diagnostics and techniques developed at the Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) instrument at Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) over the last few years. We show results in Phase Contrast Imaging geometry, where the X-ray beam propagates from the target to a camera revealing its phase, as well as in Direct Imaging geometry, where a real image of the sample plane is produced in the camera with a spatial resolution down to 200 nm. Last, we show an implementation of the Talbot Imaging method allowing both X-ray phase and intensity measurements change introduced by a target with sub-micron resolution.</description>

      <title>Advanced fabrication process for particle absorbers of highly pure electroplated gold for microcalorimeter applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs) have become a key technology for applications requiring outstanding energy resolution, fast signal rise time and excellent linearity. MMCs measure the temperature rise upon absorption of a single particle within a particle absorber by using a paramagnetic temperature sensor that is thermally coupled to the absorber. The design and fabrication of the particle absorber is key for excellent detector performance. Here, we present a microfabrication process for free-standing particle absorbers made of two stacked and independently electroplated high-purity Au layers. This enables, for example, embedding of radioactive sources within the absorber for realizing a $4\pi$ detection geometry in radionuclide metrology or preparing detector arrays with variable quantum efficiency and energy resolution as requested for future applications in high energy physics. Due to careful optimization of photoresist processing and electroplating parameters, the Au films are of very high purity and very high residual resistivity ratio values above 40, allowing for fast internal absorber thermalization.</description>

      <title>Generating a highly uniform magnetic field inside the magnetically shielded room of the n2EDM experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a coil system designed to generate a highly uniform magnetic field for the n2EDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute. It consists of a main $B_0$ coil and a set of auxiliary coils mounted on a cubic structure with a side length of 273 cm, inside a large magnetically shielded room (MSR). We have assembled this system and characerized its performances with a mapping robot. The apparatus is able to generate a 1 $\mu$ T vertical field with a relative root mean square deviation $\sigma$ ($B_z$)/$B_z$ = 3 $\times$ $10^{-5}$ over the volume of interest, a cylinder of radius 40 cm and height 30 cm. This level of uniformity overcomes the n2EDM requirements, allowing a measurement of the neutron Electric Dipole Moment with a sensitivity better than 1 $\times$ $10^{-27}$ ecm.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of the 2.6 m tall two-phase xenon time projection chamber of Xenoscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Xenoscope is a demonstrator for a next-generation xenon-based observatory for astroparticle physics, as proposed by the XLZD (XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN) collaboration. It houses a 2.6 m tall, two-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC), in a cryostat filled with $\sim$ 360 kg of liquid xenon. The main goals of the facility are to demonstrate electron drift in liquid xenon over this distance, to measure the electron cloud transversal and longitudinal diffusion, as well as the optical properties of the medium. In this work, we describe in detail the construction and commissioning of the TPC and report on the observation of light and charge signals with cosmic muons.</description>

      <title>The ATLASPix3.1 CMOS Pixel Sensor Testbeam Performance and Serial Powering Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) pixel technology is being considered for future Higgs factory experiments. The ATLASPix3.1 chip, with a pitch of 50$\mu m$ x 150$\mu m$, fabricated using TSI 180nm HV-CMOS technology, is a full reticle-size monolithic HV-CMOS sensor with shunt-low dropout (LDO) regulators that allow serial powering for multiple sensors. A beam test was conducted at DESY using 3-6 GeV electron beams, with chips operated in triggerless readout mode with zero suppression, demonstrating multi-chip capability. This was further evaluated with hadron beams, both with and without the built-in power regulators. This study presents the electrical characterisations of the shunt-LDO regulators for serial powering and test beam results of ATLASPix3.1 sensors.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present a practicable interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of Fisher information offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>In-situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Tensile Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for in situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) tensile testing that enables nanoscale characterization of the evolution of complex plasticity mechanisms. By integrating a modified in situ scanning electron microscope nanoindenter with a microscale push-to-pull device and a conventional Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) detector, we achieved TKD measurements at high spatial resolution during mechanical deformation. A dedicated focused ion beam procedure was developed for site-specific specimen fabrication, including lift-out, thinning, and shaping into a dog-bone geometry. The methodology was demonstrated on two case studies: (i) a metastable $\beta$-Ti single crystal, on which we quantified the initiation and evolution of nanoscale twinning and stress-induced martensitic transformation, and (ii) a $CuAl/Al_2O_3$ nanolaminate, which showed nanoscale plasticity and twinning/detwinning in a complex microstructure. Overall, this approach provides a robust alternative to in situ EBSD and transmission electron microscopy testing, facilitating detailed analysis of deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of FPGA and GPU Performance for Machine Learning-Based Track Reconstruction at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, the increasing luminosity and detector granularity at the Large Hadron Collider are driving the need for more efficient data processing solutions. Machine Learning has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing charged particle tracks, due to its potentially linear computational scaling with detector hits. The recent implementation of a graph neural network-based track reconstruction pipeline in the first level trigger of the LHCb experiment on GPUs serves as a platform for comparative studies between computational architectures in the context of high-energy physics. This paper presents a novel comparison of the throughput of ML model inference between FPGAs and GPUs, focusing on the first step of the track reconstruction pipeline$\unicode{x2013}$an implementation of a multilayer perceptron. Using HLS4ML for FPGA deployment, we benchmark its performance against the GPU implementation and demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for high-throughput, low-latency inference without the need for an expertise in FPGA development and while consuming significantly less power.</description>
