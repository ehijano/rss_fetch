      <title>Broadband Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting for Wearable Biosensors Using Plasmonic Field-Enhancement and Machine-Learning-Guided Device Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable biosensors increasingly require continuous and battery-free power sources, but conventional skin-mounted thermoelectric generators are limited by the small temperature differences available in real environments. This work introduces a hybrid thermoplasmonic and thermoelectric energy harvester that combines multiband plasmonic absorption with machine-learning-guided optimization to improve on-body energy conversion. A broadband metasurface made of cross-bowtie nanoantennas is designed to absorb infrared radiation across the 2 to 12 micron range, capturing human body emission, ambient infrared radiation, and near-infrared sunlight. Electromagnetic simulations show strong field enhancement in nanoscale antenna gaps, producing localized thermoplasmonic heating directly above flexible Bi2Te3 thermoelectric junctions. Coupled optical, thermal, and electrical modeling indicates that this localized heating increases the effective temperature difference from the typical 3 to 4 degrees C of standard wearable thermoelectric generators to approximately 13 degrees C. This results in a power density of about 0.15 mW per cm^2 under indoor-relevant infrared flux, representing a four- to six-fold improvement over existing flexible devices. A machine-learning surrogate model trained on multiphysics data predicts temperature rise and electrical output with high accuracy (R2 greater than 0.92) and identifies optimal device geometries through Pareto-front analysis. The proposed hybrid thermoplasmonic, thermoelectric, and machine-learning framework provides a scalable route toward more efficient, compact, and flexible energy harvesters for autonomous and long-term wearable physiological monitoring.</description>

      <title>Dflow-SUR: Enhancing Generative Aerodynamic Inverse Design using Differentiation Throughout Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative inverse design requires incorporating physical constraints to ensure that generated designs are both reliable and accurate. However, we observe that current state-of-the-art energy-based methods suffer from an asynchronous phenomenon, where the optimization of the physical loss is constrained by the flow matching inference process. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Dflow-SUR, a differentiation strategy that separates the optimization of the physical loss from the flow matching inference.
  Compared to the most advanced energy-based baseline, Dflow-SUR achieves a reduction in physical loss by four orders of magnitude, while also cutting wall-clock time by 74% on the airfoil case. Additionally, it increases the mean lift-to-drag ratio by 11.8% over traditional Latin-hypercube sampling in wing design. Beyond improvements in accuracy and efficiency, Dflow-SUR offers three additional practical advantages: (i) enhanced control over guidance, (ii) lower surrogate uncertainty, and (iii) greater robustness to hyper-parameter tuning.
  Together, these results demonstrate that Dflow-SUR is a highly promising framework, providing both scalability and high fidelity for generative aerodynamic design.</description>

      <title>Mechanical behaviour of brain-skull interface (meninges) under shear loading through experiment and finite element modelling: Preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain-skull interface (meninges) plays a critical role in governing brain motion during head impacts, yet computational models often simplify this interface using idealized contact conditions due to limited experimental data. This study presents an improved protocol combining experimental testing and computational modelling to determine the mechanical properties of the brain-skull interface under shear loading. Brain tissue and brain-skull complex samples were extracted from sheep cadaver heads and subjected to shear loading. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to obtain accurate 3D geometries of the samples, which were then used to create computational grids (meshes) for simulation of the experiments using finite element (FE) models to determine subject-specific properties of the brain tissue and brain-skull interface. A second-order Ogden hyperelastic model was used for the brain tissue, and a cohesive layer was employed to model the brain-skull interface. Our results indicate that a cohesive layer captures the force-displacement and damage initiation of the brain-skull interface. The calibrated cohesive properties showed consistent patterns across samples, with maximum normal tractions ranging from 2.8-3.4 kPa and maximum tangential tractions from 1.8-2.1 kPa. This framework provides a foundation for improving the biofidelity of computational head models used in injury prediction and neurosurgical planning by replacing arbitrary boundary conditions with formulations derived from experimental data on brain-skull interface (meninges) biomechanical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Financial News Summarization: Can extractive methods still offer a true alternative to LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets change rapidly due to news, economic shifts, and geopolitical events. Quick reactions are vital for investors to avoid losses or capture short-term gains. As a result, concise financial news summaries are critical for decision-making. With over 50,000 financial articles published daily, automation in summarization is necessary. This study evaluates a range of summarization methods, from simple extractive techniques to advanced large language models (LLMs), using the FinLLMs Challenge dataset. LLMs generated more coherent and informative summaries, but they are resource-intensive and prone to hallucinations, which can introduce significant errors into financial summaries. In contrast, extractive methods perform well on short, well-structured texts and offer a more efficient alternative for this type of article. The best ROUGE results come from fine-tuned LLM model like FT-Mistral-7B, although our data corpus has limited reliability, which calls for cautious interpretation.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship between Space-Time Accessibility and Leisure Activity Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how accessibility shapes participation in leisure activities is central to promoting inclusive and vibrant urban life. Conventional accessibility measures often focus on potential access from fixed home locations, overlooking the constraints and opportunities embedded in daily routines. In this study, we apply a space-time accessibility (STA) metric rooted in the capability approach, capturing feasible leisure opportunities between home and work given a certain time budget, individual transport modes, and urban infrastructure. Using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents in the Paris region, we assess how STA influences total travel time and leisure participation, measured as the diversity of leisure locations visited. Our analysis shows that most individuals, especially active transport users, choose destinations aligned with their STA-defined opportunity sets, underscoring the metric's validity in capturing capability sets. Structural equation modeling reveals that STA directly fosters leisure diversity but also reduces travel time, which in turn is associated with lower diversity of visited leisure locations. These findings highlight the value of person-centered, capability-informed accessibility metrics for understanding inequalities in urban mobility and informing transport planning strategies that expand real freedoms to participate in social life across diverse population groups.</description>
