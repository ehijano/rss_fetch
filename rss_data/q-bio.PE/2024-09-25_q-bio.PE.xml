      <title>Fractional and fractal extensions of epidemiological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to study the spread of disease is through mathematical models. The most successful models compartmentalize the host population according to their infectious stage, e.g., susceptible (S), infected (I), exposed (E), and recovered (R). The composition of these compartments leads to the SI, SIS, SIR, and SEIR models. In this Chapter, we present and compare three formulations of SI, SIS, SIR, and SEIR models in the framework of standard (integer operators), fractional (Caputo sense), and fractal derivatives (Hausdorff sense). As an application of the SI model, we study the evolution of AIDS cases in Bangladesh from 2001 to 2021. For this case, our simulations suggest that fractal formulation describes the data well. For the SIS model, we consider syphilis data from Brazil from 2006 to 2017. In this case, the three frameworks describe the data with good accuracy. We used data from Influenza A to adjust the SIR model in previous approaches and observed that the fractional formulation was better. The last application considers the COVID-19 data from India in the range 2020-04-10 to 2020-12-31 to adjust the parameters of the SEIR model. The standard formulation fits the data better than the other approaches. As a common result, all models exhibit steady solutions in the different formulations. The time to reach a steady solution is correlated to the considered approach. The standard and fractal formulations reach the steady state earlier when compared with the fractional formulation.</description>

      <title>Natural Selection between Two Games and Replicator Dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I study the natural selection between two games to determine, which game will dominate in the community as a result of natural selection. The formalization of this question in the form of a parametrized game and the mathematical toolbox to solve it were recently developed in (Karev 2024). Here, I applied the developed approach to natural selection between games on graphs. Specifically, I compare standard games on a complete graph with games that have updated rules suggested by Ohtsuki and Nowak (2006). The results of the natural selection between the initial and updated games, or between different updated games were visualized through the evolution of the parameter distribution in corresponding parametrized game. The developed approach can be used for other problems, such as local replicator dynamics, pairwise competition, the game of alleles in diploid genomes (see Karev 2004) and cancer modeling (Kareva, Karev 2019).</description>

      <title>Cooperation as well as learning: A commentary on 'How learning can guide evolution' by Hinton and Nowlan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Baldwin Effect learning can guide evolution. This does not suppose that information about what has been learned is transferred back into the genetic code: in the Baldwin Effect complex multi-gene characteristics are discovered through learning but acquired through standard selectionist evolutionary processes. Learning serves to improve the search by giving value to a partial, and otherwise useless, subset of the required genes. An elegant and concrete treatment of the Baldwin Effect is given in 'How learning can guide evolution', a 1987 paper by G. E. Hinton and S. J. Nowlan. This includes a simple, but revealing, simulation illustrating the effect. As a commentary on that paper, a similar simulation is used here to demonstrated that cooperation can also guide evolution. Like learning, cooperation has a clear benefit to survival, but what is proposed here is small addition: that cooperation, like learning in the Baldwin Effect, can also allow complex characteristic to be discovered and acquired much faster than they otherwise would. This suggests an additional benefit of social behavior and suggests that social animals have a broader evolutionary path towards some complex adaptations.</description>

      <title>Navigating Uncertainty: Risk-Averse vs. Risk-Prone Strategies in Populations Facing Demographic and Environmental Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategies aimed at reducing the negative effects of long-term uncertainty and risk are common in biology, game theory, and finance, even if they entail a cost in terms of mean benefit. Here, we focus on the single mutant's invasion of a finite resident population subject to fluctuating environmental conditions. Thus, the game-theoretical model we analyze integrates environmental and demographic randomness, i.e., the two leading sources of stochasticity and uncertainty. We use simulations and mathematical analysis to study if and when strategies that either increase or reduce payoff variance across environmental states can enhance the mutant fixation probability. Variance aversion implies that the mutant pays insurance in terms of mean payoff to avoid worst-case scenarios. Variance-prone or gambling strategies, on the other hand, entail specialization, allowing the mutant to capitalize on transient favorable conditions, leading to a series of ``boom-and-bust'' cycles. Our analyses elucidate how the rate of change of environmental conditions and the shape of the probability distribution of possible states affect the possible most convenient strategies. We discuss how our results relate to the bet-hedging theory, which aims to reduce fitness variance rather than payoff variance. We also describe the analogies and differences between these similar yet distinct approaches.</description>

      <title>An R package for nonparametric inference on dynamic populations with infinitely many types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fleming-Viot diffusions are widely used stochastic models for population dynamics which extend the celebrated Wright-Fisher diffusions. They describe the temporal evolution of the relative frequencies of the allelic types in an ideally infinite panmictic population, whose individuals undergo random genetic drift and at birth can mutate to a new allelic type drawn from a possibly infinite potential pool, independently of their parent. Recently, Bayesian nonparametric inference has been considered for this model when a finite sample of individuals is drawn from the population at several discrete time points. Previous works have fully described the relevant estimators for this problem, but current software is available only for the Wright-Fisher finite-dimensional case. Here we provide software for the general case, overcoming some non trivial computational challenges posed by this setting. The R package FVDDPpkg efficiently approximates the filtering and smoothing distribution for Fleming-Viot diffusions, given finite samples of individuals collected at different times. A suitable Monte Carlo approximation is also introduced in order to reduce the computational cost.</description>

      <title>A minimal compact description of the diversity index polytope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phylogenetic tree is an edge-weighted binary tree, with leaves labelled by a collection of species, that represents the evolutionary relationships between those species. For such a tree, a phylogenetic diversity index is a function that apportions the biodiversity of the collection across its constituent species. The diversity index polytope is the convex hull of the images of phylogenetic diversity indices. We study the combinatorics of phylogenetic diversity indices to provide a minimal compact description of the diversity index polytope. Furthermore, we discuss extensions of the polytope to expand the study of biodiversity measurement.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of pandemic dynamics, understanding the intricate interplay between disease transmission, interventions, and immunity is pivotal for effective control strategies. Through a rigorous agent-based computer simulation, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration, traversing unmitigated spread, lockdown scenarios, and the transformative potential of vaccination. We unveil that while quarantine unquestionably delays the pandemic peak, it does not act as an impenetrable barrier to halt the progression of infectious diseases. Vaccination factor revealed a potent weapon against outbreaks higher vaccination percentage not only delayed infection peaks but also substantially curtailed their impact. Our investigation into bond dilution below the percolation threshold presents an additional dimension to pandemic control. We observed that localized isolation through bond dilution offers a more resource-efficient targeted control strategy than blanket lockdowns or large-scale vaccination campaigns.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced survival resonances during fractional killing of cell populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional killing in response to drugs is a hallmark of non-genetic cellular heterogeneity. Yet how individual lineages evade drug treatment, as observed in bacteria and cancer cells, is not quantitatively understood. We analyse a stochastic population model with age-dependent division and death rates and characterise the emergence of fractional killing as a stochastic phenomenon under constant and periodic drug environments. In constant environments, increasing cell cycle noise induces a phase transition from complete to fractional killing, while increasing death noise can induce the reverse transition. In periodic drug environments, we discover survival resonance phenomena that give rise to peaks in the survival probabilities at division or death times that are multiples of the environment duration not seen in unstructured populations.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools. Our code is available at https://github.com/olakalisz/antibody-shapers.</description>

      <title>Wastewater-based Epidemiology for COVID-19 Surveillance and Beyond: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pandemic of COVID-19 has imposed tremendous pressure on public health systems and social economic ecosystems over the past years. To alleviate its social impact, it is important to proactively track the prevalence of COVID-19 within communities. The traditional way to estimate the disease prevalence is to estimate from reported clinical test data or surveys. However, the coverage of clinical tests is often limited and the tests can be labor-intensive, requires reliable and timely results, and consistent diagnostic and reporting criteria. Recent studies revealed that patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 often undergo fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus into wastewater, which makes wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 surveillance a promising approach to complement traditional clinical testing. In this paper, we survey the existing literature regarding wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 surveillance and summarize the current advances in the area. Specifically, we have covered the key aspects of wastewater sampling, sample testing, and presented a comprehensive and organized summary of wastewater data analytical methods. Finally, we provide the open challenges on current wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance studies, aiming to encourage new ideas to advance the development of effective wastewater-based surveillance systems for general infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that connects thermodynamic dissipation to replicator per-capita decay and growth rates. We argue from basic thermodynamic principles against this interpretation. In fact, we suggest that such a relationship cannot exist in principle, because it is impossible for a thermodynamically-consistent replicator to undergo both per-capita growth and per-capita decay back into reactants. Instead, replicator may decay into separate waste products, but in that case, replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship that connects their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>
