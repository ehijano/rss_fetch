      <title>Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge: A Coordination Fabric for Billions of Minds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond centralized constraints.</description>

      <title>When Is Diversity Rewarded in Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.</description>

      <title>Effective Red-Teaming of Policy-Adherent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies, appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger, research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks</description>

      <title>Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic for Dual-Objective Control of Multi-UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives: maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently, an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment demonstrates GADC's superior performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Language Models: Advancing Cooperation, Coordination, and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question: can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.</description>

      <title>A Call for Collaborative Intelligence: Why Human-Agent Systems Should Precede AI Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful partnership.</description>

      <title>ReasonMed: A 370K Multi-Agent Generated Dataset for Advancing Medical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner} to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.</description>

      <title>Delegations as Adaptive Representation Patterns: Rethinking Influence in Liquid Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid democracy is a mechanism for the division of labor in decision-making through the transitive delegation of influence. In essence, all individuals possess the autonomy to determine the issues with which they will engage directly, while for other matters, they may appoint a representative of their choosing. So far, the literature has studied the delegation structures emerging in liquid democracy as static. As a result, transitivity defined as the capacity to transfer acquired authority to another entity, has been identified as a concern as it would be conducive to unrestrained accumulation of power.
  Focusing on the implementation of liquid democracy supported by the LiquidFeedback software, we propose a novel approach to assessing the influence of voting nodes in a transitive delegation graph, taking into account the process nature of real-world liquid democracy in which delegation and voting are distinct and increasingly independent activities. By introducing a novel model of delegations in liquid democracy, we show how transitivity may in fact contribute to an effective regulation of deliberation influence and decision-making power. While maintaining the one-person, one-vote paradigm for all votes cast, the anticipated influence of an agent, to the extent it is stemming from transitivity, experiences a precipitous decline following an exponential trajectory.
  In general, it is our objective to move the first steps towards a rigorous analysis of liquid democracy as an adaptive democratic representation process. The adaptivity aspect of liquid democracy has not yet been explored within the existing academic literature despite it being, we believe, one of its most important features. We therefore also outline a research agenda focusing on this aspect of liquid democracy.</description>

      <title>Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00570v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. While the benefits of platooning and the formation of platoons are well understood for trucks, they are less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than solely for platooning. We demonstrate the new metric for the total trip cost in a numerical analysis and explain its interpretation. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed platoon formation algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across various critical infrastructure domains, including transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in the design and deployment of AI systems, driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives, introduces a crucial challenge: How can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos or compromising safety? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to adjust their objectives dynamically, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through two case studies in critical infrastructure applications, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these multi-agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>A Replica for our Democracies? On Using Digital Twins to Enhance Deliberative Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deliberative democracy depends on carefully designed institutional frameworks, such as participant selection, facilitation methods, and decision-making mechanisms, that shape how deliberation performs. However, identifying optimal institutional designs for specific contexts remains challenging when relying solely on real-world observations or laboratory experiments: they can be expensive, ethically and methodologically tricky, or too limited in scale to give us clear answers. Computational experiments offer a complementary approach, enabling researchers to conduct large-scale investigations while systematically analyzing complex dynamics, emergent and unexpected collective behavior, and risks or opportunities associated with novel democratic designs. Therefore, this paper explores Digital Twin (DT) technology as a computational testing ground for deliberative systems (with potential applicability to broader institutional analysis). By constructing dynamic models that simulate real-world deliberation, DTs allow researchers and policymakers to rigorously test "what-if" scenarios across diverse institutional configurations in a controlled virtual environment. This approach facilitates evidence-based assessment of novel designs using synthetically generated data, bypassing the constraints of real-world or lab-based experimentation, and without societal disruption. The paper also discusses the limitations of this new methodological approach and suggests where future research should focus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</description>

      <title>MedChat: A Multi-Agent Framework for Multimodal Diagnosis with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

      <title>Sim-to-Real Causal Transfer: A Metric Learning Approach to Causally-Aware Interaction Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling spatial-temporal interactions among neighboring agents is at the heart of multi-agent problems such as motion forecasting and crowd navigation. Despite notable progress, it remains unclear to which extent modern representations can capture the causal relationships behind agent interactions. In this work, we take an in-depth look at the causal awareness of these representations, from computational formalism to real-world practice. First, we cast doubt on the notion of non-causal robustness studied in the recent CausalAgents benchmark. We show that recent representations are already partially resilient to perturbations of non-causal agents, and yet modeling indirect causal effects involving mediator agents remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a metric learning approach that regularizes latent representations with causal annotations. Our controlled experiments show that this approach not only leads to higher degrees of causal awareness but also yields stronger out-of-distribution robustness. To further operationalize it in practice, we propose a sim-to-real causal transfer method via cross-domain multi-task learning. Experiments on pedestrian datasets show that our method can substantially boost generalization, even in the absence of real-world causal annotations. We hope our work provides a new perspective on the challenges and pathways towards causally-aware representations of multi-agent interactions.

      <title>Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems</title>

Abstract: Prevailing accounts in both multi-agent AI and the social sciences explain social structure through top-down abstractions-such as institutions, norms, or trust-yet lack simulateable models of how such structures emerge from individual behavior. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggests that reciprocity served as the foundational mechanism of early human societies, enabling economic circulation, social cohesion, and interpersonal obligation long before the rise of formal institutions. Modern financial systems such as credit and currency can likewise be viewed as scalable extensions of reciprocity, formalizing exchange across time and anonymity. Building on this insight, we argue that reciprocity is not merely a local or primitive exchange heuristic, but the scalable substrate from which large-scale social structures can emerge. We propose a three-stage framework to model this emergence: reciprocal dynamics at the individual level, norm stabilization through shared expectations, and the construction of durable institutional patterns. This approach offers a cognitively minimal, behaviorally grounded foundation for simulating how large-scale social systems can emerge from decentralized reciprocal interaction.</description>

      <title>AI Agent Behavioral Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of AI agents that exhibit increasingly human-like behaviors, including planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios. These behaviors are not solely the product of the internal architectures of the underlying models, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems operating within specific contexts, where environmental factors, social cues, and interaction feedbacks shape behavior over time. This evolution necessitates a new scientific perspective: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this perspective emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual agent, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional model-centric approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.</description>
