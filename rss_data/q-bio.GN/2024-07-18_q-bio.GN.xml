      <title>High nucleotide skew palindromic DNA sequences function as replication origins due to their unzipping propensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locations of DNA replication initiation in prokaryotes, called "origins of replication", are well-characterized. However, a mechanistic understanding of the sequence-dependence of the local unzipping of double-stranded DNA, the first step towards replication initiation, is lacking. Here, utilizing a Markov chain model that was created to address the directional nature of DNA unzipping and replication, we model the sequence dependence of local melting of double-stranded linear DNA segments. We show that generalized palindromic sequences with high nucleotide skews have a low kinetic barrier for local melting near melting temperatures. This allows for such sequences to function as replication origins. We support our claim with evidence for high-skew palindromic sequences within the replication origins of mitochondrial DNA, bacteria, archaea and plasmids.</description>

      <title>SpaDiT: Diffusion Transformer for Spatial Gene Expression Prediction using scRNA-seq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies is revolutionizing our understanding of the spatial organization of biological tissues. Current ST methods, categorized into next-generation sequencing-based (seq-based) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-based (image-based) methods, offer innovative insights into the functional dynamics of biological tissues. However, these methods are limited by their cellular resolution and the quantity of genes they can detect. To address these limitations, we propose SpaDiT, a deep learning method that utilizes a diffusion generative model to integrate scRNA-seq and ST data for the prediction of undetected genes. By employing a Transformer-based diffusion model, SpaDiT not only accurately predicts unknown genes but also effectively generates the spatial structure of ST genes. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SpaDiT through extensive experiments on both seq-based and image-based ST data. SpaDiT significantly contributes to ST gene prediction methods with its innovative approach. Compared to eight leading baseline methods, SpaDiT achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics, highlighting its substantial bioinformatics contribution.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Genomics with Reinforcement Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including decision-making and genomics. The exponential growth of raw genomic data over the past two decades has exceeded the capacity of manual analysis, leading to a growing interest in automatic data analysis and processing. RL algorithms are capable of learning from experience with minimal human supervision, making them well-suited for genomic data analysis and interpretation. One of the key benefits of using RL is the reduced cost associated with collecting labeled training data, which is required for supervised learning. While there have been numerous studies examining the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in genomics, this survey focuses exclusively on the use of RL in various genomics research fields, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), genome assembly, and sequence alignment. We present a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on the application of RL in genomics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. We then discuss potential research directions that are worthy of future exploration, including the development of more sophisticated reward functions as RL heavily depends on the accuracy of the reward function, the integration of RL with other machine learning techniques, and the application of RL to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we present our findings and conclude by summarizing the current state of the field and the future outlook for RL in genomics.</description>
