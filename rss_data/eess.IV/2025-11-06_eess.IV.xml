      <title>Optimizing the nnU-Net model for brain tumor (Glioma) segmentation Using a BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical achievement in modern medical science, developed over decades of research. It allows for the exact delineation of anatomical and pathological features in two- or three-dimensional pictures by utilizing notions like pixel intensity, texture, and anatomical context. With the advent of automated segmentation, physicians and radiologists may now concentrate on diagnosis and treatment planning while intelligent computers perform routine image processing tasks.
  This study used the BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset, a selected subset of the BraTS dataset that included 60 multimodal MRI cases from patients with glioma. Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances performed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of 360 cases. Hypothetically, the offline augmentations introduced artificial anatomical variances or intensity distributions, reducing generalization. In contrast, the original dataset, when paired with nnU Net's robust online augmentation procedures, maintained realistic variability and produced better results. The study achieved a Dice score of 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation. These findings highlight the significance of data quality and proper augmentation approaches in constructing accurate, generalizable medical picture segmentation models, particularly for under-represented locations.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adaptive Transformer for Data-Efficient Glioma Segmentation in Sub-Saharan MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioma segmentation is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet remains challenging in Sub-Saharan Africa due to limited MRI infrastructure and heterogeneous acquisition protocols that induce severe domain shift. We propose SegFormer3D-plus, a radiomics-guided transformer architecture designed for robust segmentation under domain variability. Our method combines: (1) histogram matching for intensity harmonization across scanners, (2) radiomic feature extraction with PCA-reduced k-means for domain-aware stratified sampling, (3) a dual-pathway encoder with frequency-aware feature extraction and spatial-channel attention, and (4) composite Dice-Cross-Entropy loss for boundary refinement. Pretrained on BraTS 2023 and fine-tuned on BraTS-Africa data, SegFormer3D-plus demonstrates improved tumor subregion delineation and boundary localization across heterogeneous African clinical scans, highlighting the value of radiomics-guided domain adaptation for resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>SAAIPAA: Optimizing aspect-angles-invariant physical adversarial attacks on SAR target recognition models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables versatile, all-time, all-weather remote sensing. Coupled with automatic target recognition (ATR) leveraging machine learning (ML), SAR is empowering a wide range of Earth observation and surveillance applications. However, the surge of attacks based on adversarial perturbations against the ML algorithms underpinning SAR ATR is prompting the need for systematic research into adversarial perturbation mechanisms. Research in this area began in the digital (image) domain and evolved into the physical (signal) domain, resulting in physical adversarial attacks (PAAs) that strategically exploit corner reflectors as attack vectors to evade ML-based ATR. This paper proposes a novel framework called SAR Aspect-Angles-Invariant Physical Adversarial Attack (SAAIPAA) for physics-based modelling of reflector-actuated adversarial perturbations, which improves on the rigor of prior work. A unique feature of SAAIPAA is its ability to remain effective even when the attacker lacks knowledge of the SAR platform's aspect angles, by deploying at least one reflector in each azimuthal quadrant and optimizing reflector orientations. The resultant physical evasion attacks are efficiently realizable and optimal over the considered range of aspect angles between a SAR platform and a target, achieving state-of-the-art fooling rates (over 80% for DenseNet-121 and ResNet50) in the white-box setting. When aspect angles are known to the attacker, an average fooling rate of 99.2% is attainable. In black-box settings, although the attack efficacy of SAAIPAA transfers well between some models (e.g., from ResNet50 to DenseNet121), the transferability to some models (e.g., MobileNetV2) can be improved. A useful outcome of using the MSTAR dataset for the experiments in this article, a method for generating bounding boxes for densely sampled azimuthal SAR datasets is introduced.</description>

      <title>Morpho-Genomic Deep Learning for Ovarian Cancer Subtype and Gene Mutation Prediction from Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, largely due to late diagnosis and extensive heterogeneity across subtypes. Current diagnostic methods are limited in their ability to reveal underlying genomic variations essential for precision oncology. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning pipeline that integrates quantitative nuclear morphometry with deep convolutional image features to perform ovarian cancer subtype classification and gene mutation inference directly from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) histopathological images. Using $\sim45,000$ image patches sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and public datasets, a fusion model combining a ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a Vision Transformer (ViT) was developed. This model successfully captured both local morphological texture and global tissue context. The pipeline achieved a robust overall subtype classification accuracy of $84.2\%$ (Macro AUC of $0.87 \pm 0.03$). Crucially, the model demonstrated the capacity for gene mutation inference with moderate-to-high accuracy: $AUC_{TP53} = 0.82 \pm 0.02$, $AUC_{BRCA1} = 0.76 \pm 0.04$, and $AUC_{ARID1A} = 0.73 \pm 0.05$. Feature importance analysis established direct quantitative links, revealing that nuclear solidity and eccentricity were the dominant predictors for TP53 mutation. These findings validate that quantifiable histological phenotypes encode measurable genomic signals, paving the way for cost-effective, precision histopathology in ovarian cancer triage and diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Computational Imaging Meets LLMs: Zero-Shot IDH Mutation Prediction in Brain Gliomas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework that combines Large Language Models with computational image analytics for non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status in brain gliomas. For each subject, coregistered multi-parametric MRI scans and multi-class tumor segmentation maps were processed to extract interpretable semantic (visual) attributes and quantitative features, serialized in a standardized JSON file, and used to query GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning. We evaluated this framework on six publicly available datasets (N = 1427) and results showcased high accuracy and balanced classification performance across heterogeneous cohorts, even in the absence of manual annotations. GPT 5 outperformed GPT 4o in context-driven phenotype interpretation. Volumetric features emerged as the most important predictors, supplemented by subtype-specific imaging markers and clinical information. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM-based reasoning with computational image analytics for precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping, advancing diagnostic strategies in neuro-oncology. The code is available at https://github.com/ATPLab-LUMS/CIM-LLM.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking ResNet for Short-Term Hypoglycemia Classification with DiaData</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individualized therapy is driven forward by medical data analysis, which provides insight into the patient's context. In particular, for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), which is an autoimmune disease, relationships between demographics, sensor data, and context can be analyzed. However, outliers, noisy data, and small data volumes cannot provide a reliable analysis. Hence, the research domain requires large volumes of high-quality data. Moreover, missing values can lead to information loss. To address this limitation, this study improves the data quality of DiaData, an integration of 15 separate datasets containing glucose values from 2510 subjects with T1D. Notably, we make the following contributions: 1) Outliers are identified with the interquartile range (IQR) approach and treated by replacing them with missing values. 2) Small gaps ($\le$ 25 min) are imputed with linear interpolation and larger gaps ($\ge$ 30 and $&lt;$ 120 min) with Stineman interpolation. Based on a visual comparison, Stineman interpolation provides more realistic glucose estimates than linear interpolation for larger gaps. 3) After data cleaning, the correlation between glucose and heart rate is analyzed, yielding a moderate relation between 15 and 60 minutes before hypoglycemia ($\le$ 70 mg/dL). 4) Finally, a benchmark for hypoglycemia classification is provided with a state-of-the-art ResNet model. The model is trained with the Maindatabase and Subdatabase II of DiaData to classify hypoglycemia onset up to 2 hours in advance. Training with more data improves performance by 7% while using quality-refined data yields a 2-3% gain compared to raw data.</description>

      <title>NEF-NET+: Adapting Electrocardio panorama in the wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems capture cardiac signals from a fixed set of anatomical viewpoints defined by lead placement. However, certain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require additional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns that may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG devices, and compensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode placement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model architecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow comprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an on-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama benchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per subject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity. Experimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The code and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication.</description>

      <title>ISC-Perception: A Hybrid Computer Vision Dataset for Object Detection in Novel Steel Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial use upon request.</description>

      <title>OneOcc: Semantic Occupancy Prediction for Legged Robots with a Single Panoramic Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust 3D semantic occupancy is crucial for legged/humanoid robots, yet most semantic scene completion (SSC) systems target wheeled platforms with forward-facing sensors. We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity. OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and (iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08 (cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround perception for legged/humanoid robots. Datasets and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/MasterHow/OneOcc.</description>

      <title>MAROON: A Framework for the Joint Characterization of Near-Field High-Resolution Radar and Optical Depth Imaging Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the complementary strengths of wavelength-specific range or depth sensors is crucial for robust computer-assisted tasks such as autonomous driving. Despite this, there is still little research done at the intersection of optical depth sensors and radars operating close range, where the target is decimeters away from the sensors. Together with a growing interest in high-resolution imaging radars operating in the near field, the question arises how these sensors behave in comparison to their traditional optical counterparts.
  In this work, we take on the unique challenge of jointly characterizing depth imagers from both, the optical and radio-frequency domain using a multimodal spatial calibration. We collect data from four depth imagers, with three optical sensors of varying operation principle and an imaging radar. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of their depth measurements with respect to distinct object materials, geometries, and object-to-sensor distances. Specifically, we reveal scattering effects of partially transmissive materials and investigate the response of radio-frequency signals. All object measurements will be made public in form of a multimodal dataset, called MAROON.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Hyperparameter-Tuning Burden in SVM Classifiers for Pulmonary Nodules Diagnosis with Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of non-invasive medical imaging, radiomic features are utilized to measure tumor characteristics. However, these features can be affected by the techniques used to discretize the images, ultimately impacting the accuracy of diagnosis. To investigate the influence of various image discretization methods on diagnosis, it is common practice to evaluate multiple discretization strategies individually. This approach often leads to redundant and time-consuming tasks such as training predictive models and fine-tuning hyperparameters separately. This study examines the feasibility of employing multi-task Bayesian optimization to accelerate the hyperparameters search for classifying benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using RBF SVM. Our findings suggest that multi-task Bayesian optimization significantly accelerates the search for hyperparameters in comparison to a single-task approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation to utilize multi-task Bayesian optimization in a critical medical context.</description>

      <title>NeurOp-Diff:Continuous Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution via Neural Operator Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most publicly accessible remote sensing data suffer from low resolution, limiting their practical applications. To address this, we propose a diffusion model guided by neural operators for continuous remote sensing image super-resolution (NeurOp-Diff). Neural operators are used to learn resolution representations at arbitrary scales, encoding low-resolution (LR) images into high-dimensional features, which are then used as prior conditions to guide the diffusion model for denoising. This effectively addresses the artifacts and excessive smoothing issues present in existing super-resolution (SR) methods, enabling the generation of high-quality, continuous super-resolution images. Specifically, we adjust the super-resolution scale by a scaling factor s, allowing the model to adapt to different super-resolution magnifications. Furthermore, experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurOp-Diff. Our code is available at https://github.com/zerono000/NeurOp-Diff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remain key challenges in medical image analysis, primarily due to the lack of high-quality, balanced, and diverse datasets with expert annotations. In this work, we address this gap by introducing BRISC, a dataset designed for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks, featuring high-resolution segmentation masks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans, which were collated from multiple public datasets that lacked segmentation labels. Our primary contribution is the subsequent expert annotation of these images, performed by certified radiologists and physicians. It includes three major tumor types, namely glioma, meningioma, and pituitary, as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide benchmark results for both tasks using standard deep learning models. The BRISC dataset is made publicly available. datasetlink: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/briscdataset/brisc2025/), Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30533120), Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17524350)</description>

      <title>A Versatile Depth Video Encoding Scheme Based on Low-rank Tensor Modeling for Free Viewpoint Video</title>

Abstract: The compression quality losses of depth sequences determine quality of view synthesis in free-viewpoint video. The depth map intra prediction in 3D extensions of the HEVC applies intra modes with auxiliary depth modeling modes (DMMs) to better preserve depth edges and handle motion discontinuities. Although such modes enable high efficiency compression, but at the cost of very high encoding complexity. Skipping conventional intra coding modes and DMMs in depth coding limits practical applicability of the HEVC for 3D display applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel low-complexity scheme for depth video compression based on low-rank tensor decomposition and HEVC intra coding. The proposed scheme leverages spatial and temporal redundancy by compactly representing the depth sequence as a high-order tensor. Tensor factorization into a set of factor matrices following CANDECOMP PARAFAC (CP) decomposition via alternating least squares give a low-rank approximation of the scene geometry. Further, compression of factor matrices with HEVC intra prediction support arbitrary target accuracy by flexible adjustment of bitrate, varying tensor decomposition ranks and quantization parameters. The results demonstrate proposed approach achieves significant rate gains by efficiently compressing depth planes in low-rank approximated representation. The proposed algorithm is applied to encode depth maps of benchmark Ballet and Breakdancing sequences. The decoded depth sequences are used for view synthesis in a multi-view video system, maintaining appropriate rendering quality.</description>

      <title>FusionRF: High-Fidelity Satellite Neural Radiance Fields from Multispectral and Panchromatic Acquisitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FusionRF, a novel framework for digital surface reconstruction from satellite multispectral and panchromatic images. Current work has demonstrated the increased accuracy of neural photogrammetry for surface reconstruction from optical satellite images compared to algorithmic methods. Common satellites produce both a panchromatic and multispectral image, which contain high spatial and spectral information respectively. Current neural reconstruction methods require multispectral images to be upsampled with a pansharpening method using the spatial data in the panchromatic image. However, these methods may introduce biases and hallucinations due to domain gaps. FusionRF introduces joint image fusion during optimization through a novel cross-resolution kernel that learns to resolve spatial resolution loss present in multispectral images. As input, FusionRF accepts the original multispectral and panchromatic data, eliminating the need for image preprocessing. FusionRF also leverages multimodal appearance embeddings that encode the image characteristics of each modality and view within a uniform representation. By optimizing on both modalities, FusionRF learns to fuse image modalities while performing reconstruction tasks and eliminates the need for a pansharpening preprocessing step. We evaluate our method on multispectral and panchromatic satellite images from the WorldView-3 satellite in various locations, and show that FusionRF provides an average of 17% reduction in depth reconstruction error, and renders sharp training and novel views.</description>

      <title>Reliability Assessment Framework Based on Feature Separability for Pathological Cell Image Classification under Prior Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and objective: Prior probability shift between training and deployment datasets challenges deep learning-based medical image classification. Standard correction methods reweight posterior probabilities to adjust prior bias, yet their benefit is inconsistent. We developed a reliability framework identifying when prior correction helps or harms performance in pathological cell image analysis. Methods: We analyzed 303 colorectal cancer specimens with CD103/CD8 immunostaining, yielding 185,432 annotated cell images across 16 cell types. ResNet models were trained under varying bias ratios (1.1-20$\times$). Feature separability was quantified using cosine similarity-based likelihood quality scores, reflecting intra- versus inter-class distinctions in learned feature spaces. Multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized additive models (GAMs) evaluated associations among feature separability, prior bias, sample adequacy, and F1 performance. Results: Feature separability dominated performance ($\beta = 1.650$, $p &lt; 0.001$), showing 412-fold stronger impact than prior bias ($\beta = 0.004$, $p = 0.018$). GAM analysis showed strong predictive power ($R^2 = 0.876$) with mostly linear trends. A quality threshold of 0.294 effectively identified cases requiring correction (AUC = 0.610). Cell types scoring $&gt;0.5$ were robust without correction, whereas those $&lt;0.3$ consistently required adjustment. Conclusion: Feature extraction quality, not bias magnitude, governs correction benefit. The proposed framework provides quantitative guidance for selective correction, enabling efficient deployment and reliable diagnostic AI.</description>
