      <title>Immunometabolism at the Crossroads of Infection: Mechanistic and Systems-Level Perspectives from Host and Pathogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of immunometabolism has underscored the central role of metabolic pathways in orchestrating immune cell function. Far from being passive background processes, metabolic activities actively regulate key immune responses. Fundamental pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation critically shape the behavior of immune cells, influencing macrophage polarization, T cell activation, and dendritic cell function. In this review, we synthesize recent advances in immunometabolism, with a focus on the metabolic mechanisms that govern the responses of both innate and adaptive immune cells to bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Drawing on experimental, computational, and integrative methodologies, we highlight how metabolic reprogramming contributes to host defense in response to infection. These findings reveal new opportunities for therapeutic intervention, suggesting that modulation of metabolic pathways could enhance immune function and improve pathogen clearance.</description>

      <title>Insights into new mechanosensitive behaviors of G protein-coupled receptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a diverse and vital family of membrane proteins that mediate intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli, playing critical roles in physiology and disease. Traditionally recognized as chemical signal transducers, GPCRs have recently been implicated in mechanotransduction, the process of converting mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. This review explores the emerging role of GPCRs in sensing and responding to mechanical forces, with a particular focus on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular homeostasis is heavily influenced by mechanical forces such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and pressure, which are central to both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of diseases like hypertension and atherosclerosis. GPCRs, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the \b{eta}2-adrenergic receptor (\b{eta}2-AR), have demonstrated the ability to integrate mechanical and chemical signals, potentially through conformational changes and/or modulation of lipid interactions, leading to biased signaling. Recent studies highlight the dual activation mechanisms of GPCRs, with \b{eta}2-AR now serving as a key example of how mechanical and ligand-dependent pathways contribute to cardiovascular regulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge of GPCR mechanosensitivity, emphasizing its implications for cardiovascular health and disease, and explores advancements in methodologies poised to further unravel the mechanistic intricacies of these receptors.</description>

      <title>A novel sensitivity analysis method for agent-based models stratifies in-silico tumor spheroid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in biology to understand how individual actions scale into emergent population behavior. Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the Simulate, Summarize, Reduce, Cluster, and Analyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA provides similar SA results to the popular Sobol' Method while also identifying four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.</description>
