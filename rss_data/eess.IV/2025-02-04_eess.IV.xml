      <title>LSU-Net: Lightweight Automatic Organs Segmentation Network For Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UNet and its variants have widespread applications in medical image segmentation. However, the substantial number of parameters and computational complexity of these models make them less suitable for use in clinical settings with limited computational resources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Lightweight Shift U-Net (LSU-Net). We integrate the Light Conv Block and the Tokenized Shift Block in a lightweight manner, combining them with a dynamic weight multi-loss design for efficient dynamic weight allocation. The Light Conv Block effectively captures features with a low parameter count by combining standard convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions. The Tokenized Shift Block optimizes feature representation by shifting and capturing deep features through a combination of the Spatial Shift Block and depthwise separable convolutions. Dynamic adjustment of the loss weights at each layer approaches the optimal solution and enhances training stability. We validated LSU-Net on the UWMGI and MSD Colon datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that LSU-Net outperforms most state-of-the-art segmentation architectures.</description>

      <title>Deep Ensembling with Multimodal Image Fusion for Efficient Classification of Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the classification of cancerous and healthy slices from multimodal lung images. The data used in the research comprises Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. The proposed strategy achieves the fusion of PET and CT images by utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an Autoencoder. Subsequently, a new ensemble-based classifier developed, Deep Ensembled Multimodal Fusion (DEMF), employing majority voting to classify the sample images under examination. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) employed to visualize the classification accuracy of cancer-affected images. Given the limited sample size, a random image augmentation strategy employed during the training phase. The DEMF network helps mitigate the challenges of scarce data in computer-aided medical image analysis. The proposed network compared with state-of-the-art networks across three publicly available datasets. The network outperforms others based on the metrics - Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall. The investigation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed network.</description>

      <title>Advanced Assessment of Stroke in Retinal Fundus Imaging with Deep Multi-view Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stroke is globally a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and hence accurate and rapid diagnosis of stroke is valuable. Retinal fundus imaging reveals the known markers of elevated stroke risk in the eyes, which are retinal venular widening, arteriolar narrowing, and increased tortuosity. In contrast to other imaging techniques used for stroke diagnosis, the acquisition of fundus images is easy, non-invasive, fast, and inexpensive. Therefore, in this study, we propose a multi-view stroke network (MVS-Net) to detect stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) using retinal fundus images. Contrary to existing studies, our study proposes for the first time a solution to discriminate stroke and TIA with deep multi-view learning by proposing an end-to-end deep network, consisting of multi-view inputs of fundus images captured from both right and left eyes. Accordingly, the proposed MVS-Net defines representative features from fundus images of both eyes and determines the relation within their macula-centered and optic nerve head-centered views. Experiments performed on a dataset collected from stroke and TIA patients, in addition to healthy controls, show that the proposed framework achieves an AUC score of 0.84 for stroke and TIA detection.</description>

      <title>Multimodal MRI-Ultrasound AI for Prostate Cancer Detection Outperforms Radiologist MRI Interpretation: A Multi-Center Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-biopsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to target suspicious prostate lesions. This has led to artificial intelligence (AI) applications improving MRI-based detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (CsPCa). However, MRI-detected lesions must still be mapped to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images during biopsy, which results in missing CsPCa. This study systematically evaluates a multimodal AI framework integrating MRI and TRUS image sequences to enhance CsPCa identification. The study included 3110 patients from three cohorts across two institutions who underwent prostate biopsy. The proposed framework, based on the 3D UNet architecture, was evaluated on 1700 test cases, comparing performance to unimodal AI models that use either MRI or TRUS alone. Additionally, the proposed model was compared to radiologists in a cohort of 110 patients. The multimodal AI approach achieved superior sensitivity (80%) and Lesion Dice (42%) compared to unimodal MRI (73%, 30%) and TRUS models (49%, 27%). Compared to radiologists, the multimodal model showed higher specificity (88% vs. 78%) and Lesion Dice (38% vs. 33%), with equivalent sensitivity (79%). Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal AI to improve CsPCa lesion targeting during biopsy and treatment planning, surpassing current unimodal models and radiologists; ultimately improving outcomes for prostate cancer patients.</description>

      <title>Improving Quality Control Of MRI Images Using Synthetic Motion Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI quality control (QC) is challenging due to unbalanced and limited datasets, as well as subjective scoring, which hinder the development of reliable automated QC systems. To address these issues, we introduce an approach that pretrains a model on synthetically generated motion artifacts before applying transfer learning for QC classification. This method not only improves the accuracy in identifying poor-quality scans but also reduces training time and resource requirements compared to training from scratch. By leveraging synthetic data, we provide a more robust and resource-efficient solution for QC automation in MRI, paving the way for broader adoption in diverse research settings.</description>

      <title>Patch Triplet Similarity Purification for Guided Real-World Low-Dose CT Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image denoising of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is an important problem for clinical diagnosis with reduced radiation exposure. Previous methods are mostly trained with pairs of synthetic or misaligned LDCT and normal-dose CT (NDCT) images. However, trained with synthetic noise or misaligned LDCT/NDCT image pairs, the denoising networks would suffer from blurry structure or motion artifacts. Since non-contrast CT (NCCT) images share the content characteristics to the corresponding NDCT images in a three-phase scan, they can potentially provide useful information for real-world LDCT image denoising. To exploit this aspect, in this paper, we propose to incorporate clean NCCT images as useful guidance for the learning of real-world LDCT image denoising networks. To alleviate the issue of spatial misalignment in training data, we design a new Patch Triplet Similarity Purification (PTSP) strategy to select highly similar patch (instead of image) triplets of LDCT, NDCT, and NCCT images for network training. Furthermore, we modify two image denoising transformers of SwinIR and HAT to accommodate the NCCT image guidance, by replacing vanilla self-attention with cross-attention. On our collected clinical dataset, the modified transformers trained with the data selected by our PTSP strategy show better performance than 15 comparison methods on real-world LDCT image denoising. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our NCCT image guidance and PTSP strategy. We will publicly release our data and code.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Performance of U-Net Modifications in Retroperitoneal Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The retroperitoneum hosts a variety of tumors, including rare benign and malignant types, which pose diagnostic and treatment challenges due to their infrequency and proximity to vital structures. Estimating tumor volume is difficult due to their irregular shapes, and manual segmentation is time-consuming. Automatic segmentation using U-Net and its variants, incorporating Vision Transformer (ViT) elements, has shown promising results but struggles with high computational demands. To address this, architectures like the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) and Extended Long-Short Term Memory (xLSTM) offer efficient solutions by handling long-range dependencies with lower resource consumption. This study evaluates U-Net enhancements, including CNN, ViT, Mamba, and xLSTM, on a new in-house CT dataset and a public organ segmentation dataset. The proposed ViLU-Net model integrates Vi-blocks for improved segmentation. Results highlight xLSTM's efficiency in the U-Net framework. The code is publicly accessible on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Prostate-Specific Foundation Models for Enhanced Detection of Clinically Significant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prostate cancer diagnosis remains challenging. Even when using MRI, radiologists exhibit low specificity and significant inter-observer variability, leading to potential delays or inaccuracies in identifying clinically significant cancers. This leads to numerous unnecessary biopsies and risks of missing clinically significant cancers. Here we present prostate vision contrastive network (ProViCNet), prostate organ-specific vision foundation models for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound imaging (TRUS) for comprehensive cancer detection. ProViCNet was trained and validated using 4,401 patients across six institutions, as a prostate cancer detection model on radiology images relying on patch-level contrastive learning guided by biopsy confirmed radiologist annotations. ProViCNet demonstrated consistent performance across multiple internal and external validation cohorts with area under the receiver operating curve values ranging from 0.875 to 0.966, significantly outperforming radiologists in the reader study (0.907 versus 0.805, p&lt;0.001) for mpMRI, while achieving 0.670 to 0.740 for TRUS. We also integrated ProViCNet with standard PSA to develop a virtual screening test, and we showed that we can maintain the high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant cancers while more than doubling specificity from 15% to 38% (p&lt;0.001), thereby substantially reducing unnecessary biopsies. These findings highlight that ProViCNet's potential for enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis accuracy and reduce unnecessary biopsies, thereby optimizing diagnostic pathways.</description>

      <title>Segment Anything for Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleus segmentation is an important analysis task in digital pathology. However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/patho-sam.</description>

      <title>Deep Task-Based Beamforming and Channel Data Augmentations for Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning (DL)-based framework for task-based ultrasound (US) beamforming, aiming to enhance clinical outcomes by integrating specific clinical tasks directly into the beamforming process. Task-based beamforming optimizes the beamformer not only for image quality but also for performance on a particular clinical task, such as lesion classification. The proposed framework explores two approaches: (1) a Joint Beamformer and Classifier (JBC) that classifies the US images generated by the beamformer to provide feedback for image quality improvement; and (2) a Channel Data Classifier Beamformer (CDCB) that incorporates classification directly at the channel data representation within the beamformer's bottleneck layer. Additionally, we introduce channel data augmentations to address challenges posed by noisy and limited in-vivo data. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that training with channel data augmentations significantly improves image quality. The proposed methods were evaluated against conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Minimum Variance (MV) beamforming techniques, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both image contrast and clinical relevance. Among all methods, the CDCB approach achieves the best results, outperforming others in terms of image quality and clinical relevance. These approaches exhibit significant potential for improving clinical relevance and image quality in ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <title>Distribution-aware Fairness Learning in Medical Image Segmentation From A Control-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in medical image segmentation is critical due to biases in imbalanced clinical data acquisition caused by demographic attributes (e.g., age, sex, race) and clinical factors (e.g., disease severity). To address these challenges, we introduce Distribution-aware Mixture of Experts (dMoE), inspired by optimal control theory. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its underlying mechanisms and clarify dMoE's role in adapting to heterogeneous distributions in medical image segmentation. Furthermore, we integrate dMoE into multiple network architectures, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse medical image analysis tasks. By incorporating demographic and clinical factors, dMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 2D benchmark datasets and a 3D in-house dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dMoE in mitigating biases from imbalanced distributions, offering a promising approach to bridging control theory and medical image segmentation within fairness learning paradigms. The source code will be made available.</description>

      <title>Registration-Enhanced Segmentation Method for Prostate Cancer in Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in men, where early detection greatly improves survival rates. Although MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy offers superior accuracy by combining MRI's detailed visualization with TRUS's real-time guidance, it is a complex and time-intensive procedure that relies heavily on manual annotations, leading to potential errors. To address these challenges, we propose a fully automatic MRI-TRUS fusion-based segmentation method that identifies prostate tumors directly in TRUS images without requiring manual annotations. Unlike traditional multimodal fusion approaches that rely on naive data concatenation, our method integrates a registration-segmentation framework to align and leverage spatial information between MRI and TRUS modalities. This alignment enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces reliance on manual effort. Our approach was validated on a dataset of 1,747 patients from Stanford Hospital, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 0.212, outperforming TRUS-only (0.117) and naive MRI-TRUS fusion (0.132) methods, with significant improvements (p $&lt;$ 0.01). This framework demonstrates the potential for reducing the complexity of prostate cancer diagnosis and provides a flexible architecture applicable to other multimodal medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>FetDTIAlign: A Deep Learning Framework for Affine and Deformable Registration of Fetal Brain dMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides unique insights into fetal brain microstructure in utero. Longitudinal and cross-sectional fetal dMRI studies can reveal crucial neurodevelopmental changes but require precise spatial alignment across scans and subjects. This is challenging due to low data quality, rapid brain development, and limited anatomical landmarks. Existing registration methods, designed for high-quality adult data, struggle with these complexities. To address this, we introduce FetDTIAlign, a deep learning approach for fetal brain dMRI registration, enabling accurate affine and deformable alignment. FetDTIAlign features a dual-encoder architecture and iterative feature-based inference, reducing the impact of noise and low resolution. It optimizes network configurations and domain-specific features at each registration stage, enhancing both robustness and accuracy. We validated FetDTIAlign on data from 23 to 36 weeks gestation, covering 60 white matter tracts. It consistently outperformed two classical optimization-based methods and a deep learning pipeline, achieving superior anatomical correspondence. Further validation on external data from the Developing Human Connectome Project confirmed its generalizability across acquisition protocols. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning for fetal brain dMRI registration, providing a more accurate and reliable alternative to classical techniques. By enabling precise cross-subject and tract-specific analyses, FetDTIAlign supports new discoveries in early brain development.</description>

Abstract: Lensless cameras disregard the conventional design that imaging should mimic the human eye. This is done by replacing the lens with a thin mask, and moving image formation to the digital post-processing. State-of-the-art lensless imaging techniques use learned approaches that combine physical modeling and neural networks. However, these approaches make simplifying modeling assumptions for ease of calibration and computation. Moreover, the generalizability of learned approaches to lensless measurements of new masks has not been studied. To this end, we utilize a modular learned reconstruction in which a key component is a pre-processor prior to image recovery. We theoretically demonstrate the pre-processor's necessity for standard image recovery techniques (Wiener filtering and iterative algorithms), and through extensive experiments show its effectiveness for multiple lensless imaging approaches and across datasets of different mask types (amplitude and phase). We also perform the first generalization benchmark across mask types to evaluate how well reconstructions trained with one system generalize to others. Our modular reconstruction enables us to use pre-trained components and transfer learning on new systems to cut down weeks of tedious measurements and training. As part of our work, we open-source four datasets, and software for measuring datasets and for training our modular reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>Assessing the use of Diffusion models for motion artifact correction in brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging generally requires long exposure times, while being sensitive to patient motion, resulting in artifacts in the acquired images, which may hinder their diagnostic relevance. Despite research efforts to decrease the acquisition time, and designing efficient acquisition sequences, motion artifacts are still a persistent problem, pushing toward the need for the development of automatic motion artifact correction techniques. Recently, diffusion models have been proposed as a solution for the task at hand. While diffusion models can produce high-quality reconstructions, they are also susceptible to hallucination, which poses risks in diagnostic applications. In this study, we critically evaluate the use of diffusion models for correcting motion artifacts in 2D brain MRI scans. Using a popular benchmark dataset, we compare a diffusion model-based approach with state-of-the-art methods consisting of Unets trained in a supervised fashion on motion-affected images to reconstruct ground truth motion-free images. Our findings reveal mixed results: diffusion models can produce accurate predictions or generate harmful hallucinations in this context, depending on data heterogeneity and the acquisition planes considered as input.</description>

      <title>CerraData-4MM: A multimodal benchmark dataset on Cerrado for land use and land cover classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cerrado faces increasing environmental pressures, necessitating accurate land use and land cover (LULC) mapping despite challenges such as class imbalance and visually similar categories. To address this, we present CerraData-4MM, a multimodal dataset combining Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imagery (MSI) with 10m spatial resolution. The dataset includes two hierarchical classification levels with 7 and 14 classes, respectively, focusing on the diverse Bico do Papagaio ecoregion. We highlight CerraData-4MM's capacity to benchmark advanced semantic segmentation techniques by evaluating a standard U-Net and a more sophisticated Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The ViT achieves superior performance in multimodal scenarios, with the highest macro F1-score of 57.60% and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 49.05% at the first hierarchical level. Both models struggle with minority classes, particularly at the second hierarchical level, where U-Net's performance drops to an F1-score of 18.16%. Class balancing improves representation for underrepresented classes but reduces overall accuracy, underscoring the trade-off in weighted training. CerraData-4MM offers a challenging benchmark for advancing deep learning models to handle class imbalance and multimodal data fusion. Code, trained models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4luc/CerraData-4MM.</description>

      <title>Learning Difference-of-Convex Regularizers for Inverse Problems: A Flexible Framework with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning effective regularization is crucial for solving ill-posed inverse problems, which arise in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. While data-driven methods that parameterize regularizers using deep neural networks have demonstrated strong empirical performance, they often result in highly nonconvex formulations that lack theoretical guarantees. Recent work has shown that incorporating structured nonconvexity into neural network-based regularizers, such as weak convexity, can strike a balance between empirical performance and theoretical tractability. In this paper, we demonstrate that a broader class of nonconvex functions, difference-of-convex (DC) functions, can yield improved empirical performance while retaining strong convergence guarantees. The DC structure enables the use of well-established optimization algorithms, such as the Difference-of-Convex Algorithm (DCA) and a Proximal Subgradient Method (PSM), which extend beyond standard gradient descent. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights into the conditions under which optimal regularizers can be expressed as DC functions. Extensive experiments on computed tomography (CT) reconstruction tasks show that our approach achieves strong performance across sparse and limited-view settings, consistently outperforming other weakly supervised learned regularizers.

      <title>Exploring Linear Attention Alternative for Single Image Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based single-image super-resolution (SISR) technology focuses on enhancing low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones. Although significant progress has been made, challenges remain in computational complexity and quality, particularly in remote sensing image processing. To address these issues, we propose our Omni-Scale RWKV Super-Resolution (OmniRWKVSR) model which presents a novel approach that combines the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture with feature extraction techniques such as Visual RWKV Spatial Mixing (VRSM) and Visual RWKV Channel Mixing (VRCM), aiming to overcome the limitations of existing methods and achieve superior SISR performance. This work has proved able to provide effective solutions for high-quality image reconstruction. Under the 4x Super-Resolution tasks, compared to the MambaIR model, we achieved an average improvement of 0.26% in PSNR and 0.16% in SSIM.</description>

      <title>A framework for river connectivity classification using temporal image processing and attention based neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the connectivity of water in rivers and streams is essential for effective water resource management. Increased extreme weather events associated with climate change can result in alterations to river and stream connectivity. While traditional stream flow gauges are costly to deploy and limited to large river bodies, trail camera methods are a low-cost and easily deployed alternative to collect hourly data. Image capturing, however requires stream ecologists to manually curate (select and label) tens of thousands of images per year. To improve this workflow, we developed an automated instream trail camera image classification system consisting of three parts: (1) image processing, (2) image augmentation and (3) machine learning. The image preprocessing consists of seven image quality filters, foliage-based luma variance reduction, resizing and bottom-center cropping. Images are balanced using variable amount of generative augmentation using diffusion models and then passed to a machine learning classification model in labeled form. By using the vision transformer architecture and temporal image enhancement in our framework, we are able to increase the 75% base accuracy to 90% for a new unseen site image. We make use of a dataset captured and labeled by staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection between 2018-2020. Our results indicate that a combination of temporal image processing and attention-based models are effective at classifying unseen river connectivity images.</description>

      <title>Complex Wavelet Mutual Information Loss: A Multi-Scale Loss Function for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have significantly enhanced the performance of semantic segmentation. However, class imbalance and instance imbalance remain persistent challenges, where smaller instances and thin boundaries are often overshadowed by larger structures. To address the multiscale nature of segmented objects, various models have incorporated mechanisms such as spatial attention and feature pyramid networks. Despite these advancements, most loss functions are still primarily pixel-wise, while regional and boundary-focused loss functions often incur high computational costs or are restricted to small-scale regions. To address this limitation, we propose complex wavelet mutual information (CWMI) loss, a novel loss function that leverages mutual information from subband images decomposed by a complex steerable pyramid. The complex steerable pyramid captures features across multiple orientations and preserves structural similarity across scales. Meanwhile, mutual information is well-suited for capturing high-dimensional directional features and exhibits greater noise robustness. Extensive experiments on diverse segmentation datasets demonstrate that CWMI loss achieves significant improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy and topological metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, while introducing minimal computational overhead. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CWMI-83B7/</description>

      <title>S2CFormer: Reorienting Learned Image Compression from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</description>

      <title>CardioLive: Empowering Video Streaming with Online Cardiac Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Cardiac Monitoring (OCM) emerges as a compelling enhancement for the next-generation video streaming platforms. It enables various applications including remote health, online affective computing, and deepfake detection. Yet the physiological information encapsulated in the video streams has been long neglected. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CardioLive, the first online cardiac monitoring system in video streaming platforms. We leverage the naturally co-existed video and audio streams and devise CardioNet, the first audio-visual network to learn the cardiac series. It incorporates multiple unique designs to extract temporal and spectral features, ensuring robust performance under realistic video streaming conditions. To enable the Service-On-Demand online cardiac monitoring, we implement CardioLive as a plug-and-play middleware service and develop systematic solutions to practical issues including changing FPS and unsynchronized streams. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We achieve a Mean Square Error (MAE) of 1.79 BPM error, outperforming the video-only and audio-only solutions by 69.2% and 81.2%, respectively. Our CardioLive service achieves average throughputs of 115.97 and 98.16 FPS when implemented in Zoom and YouTube. We believe our work opens up new applications for video stream systems. We will release the code soon.</description>

      <title>A method for estimating forest carbon storage distribution density via artificial intelligence generated content model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forest is the most significant land-based carbon storage mechanism. The forest carbon sink can effectively decrease the atmospheric CO2 concentration and mitigate climate change. Remote sensing estimation not only ensures high accuracy of data, but also enables large-scale area observation. Optical images provide the possibility for long-term monitoring, which is a potential issue in the future carbon storage estimation research. We chose Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China as the study area, took GF-1 WFV satellite image as the data, introduced the KD-VGG module to extract the initial features, and proposed the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM). The results showed that: (1) The VGG-19 module after knowledge distillation can realize the initial feature extraction, reduce the inference time and improve the accuracy in the case of reducing the number of model parameters. (2) The Attention + MLP module was added for feature fusion to obtain the relationship between global and local features and realized the restoration of high-fidelity images in the continuous scale range. (3) The IIDM model proposed in this paper had the highest estimation accuracy, with RMSE of 28.68, which was 13.16 higher than that of the regression model, about 31.45%. In the estimation of carbon storage, the generative model can extract deeper features, and its performance was significantly better than other models. It demonstrated the feasibility of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) in the field of quantitative remote sensing and provided valuable insights for the study of carbon neutralization effect. By combining the actual characteristics of the forest, the regional carbon storage estimation with a resolution of 16-meter was utilized to provide a significant theoretical basis for the formulation of forest carbon sink regulation.</description>

Abstract: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation. However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon stock estimation into an image translation.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Semantic Augmentation for Training Generative Adversarial Networks under Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made remarkable achievements in synthesizing images in recent years. Typically, training GANs requires massive data, and the performance of GANs deteriorates significantly when training data is limited. To improve the synthesis performance of GANs in low-data regimes, existing approaches use various data augmentation techniques to enlarge the training sets. However, it is identified that these augmentation techniques may leak or even alter the data distribution. To remedy this, we propose an adversarial semantic augmentation (ASA) technique to enlarge the training data at the semantic level instead of the image level. Concretely, considering semantic features usually encode informative information of images, we estimate the covariance matrices of semantic features for both real and generated images to find meaningful transformation directions. Such directions translate original features to another semantic representation, e.g., changing the backgrounds or expressions of the human face dataset. Moreover, we derive an upper bound of the expected adversarial loss. By optimizing the upper bound, our semantic augmentation is implicitly achieved. Such design avoids redundant sampling of the augmented features and introduces negligible computation overhead, making our approach computation efficient. Extensive experiments on both few-shot and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improve the synthesis quality under various data regimes, and further visualized and analytic results suggesting satisfactory versatility of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Automatic Picking and Manual Picking Refinement for First-Break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-break picking is a pivotal procedure in processing microseismic data for geophysics and resource exploration. Recent advancements in deep learning have catalyzed the evolution of automated methods for identifying first-break. Nevertheless, the complexity of seismic data acquisition and the requirement for detailed, expert-driven labeling often result in outliers and potential mislabeling within manually labeled datasets. These issues can negatively affect the training of neural networks, necessitating algorithms that handle outliers or mislabeled data effectively. We introduce the Simultaneous Picking and Refinement (SPR) algorithm, designed to handle datasets plagued by outlier samples or even noisy labels. Unlike conventional approaches that regard manual picks as ground truth, our method treats the true first-break as a latent variable within a probabilistic model that includes a first-break labeling prior. SPR aims to uncover this variable, enabling dynamic adjustments and improved accuracy across the dataset. This strategy mitigates the impact of outliers or inaccuracies in manual labels. Intra-site picking experiments and cross-site generalization experiments on publicly available data confirm our method's performance in identifying first-break and its generalization across different sites. Additionally, our investigations into noisy signals and labels underscore SPR's resilience to both types of noise and its capability to refine misaligned manual annotations. Moreover, the flexibility of SPR, not being limited to any single network architecture, enhances its adaptability across various deep learning-based picking methods. Focusing on learning from data that may contain outliers or partial inaccuracies, SPR provides a robust solution to some of the principal obstacles in automatic first-break picking.</description>

      <title>Multibranch Generative Models for Multichannel Imaging with an Application to PET/CT Synergistic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08748v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for learned synergistic reconstruction of medical images using multibranch generative models. Leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs), our model learns from pairs of images simultaneously, enabling effective denoising and reconstruction. Synergistic image reconstruction is achieved by incorporating the trained models in a regularizer that evaluates the distance between the images and the model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) datasets, showcasing improved image quality for low-dose imaging. Despite challenges such as patch decomposition and model limitations, our results underscore the potential of generative models for enhancing medical imaging reconstruction.</description>

      <title>DAWN: Domain-Adaptive Weakly Supervised Nuclei Segmentation via Cross-Task Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly supervised segmentation methods have gained significant attention due to their ability to reduce the reliance on costly pixel-level annotations during model training. However, the current weakly supervised nuclei segmentation approaches typically follow a two-stage pseudo-label generation and network training process. The performance of the nuclei segmentation heavily relies on the quality of the generated pseudo-labels, thereby limiting its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel domain-adaptive weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework using cross-task interaction strategies to overcome the challenge of pseudo-label generation. Specifically, we utilize weakly annotated data to train an auxiliary detection task, which assists the domain adaptation of the segmentation network. To enhance the efficiency of domain adaptation, we design a consistent feature constraint module integrating prior knowledge from the source domain. Furthermore, we develop pseudo-label optimization and interactive training methods to improve the domain transfer capability. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive comparative and ablation experiments on six datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing weakly supervised approaches. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable or even better performance than fully supervised methods. Our code will be released in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/DAWN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14568v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning classifiers face significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous multi-modal and multi-organ biomedical datasets. The low-level feature distinguishability limited to imaging-modality hinders the classifiers' ability to learn high-level semantic relationships, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, image augmentation strategies are employed as regularization techniques. While additive noise input during network training is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern pipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay. This preference stems from the observation that combining these established techniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance. In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to generate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on multi-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, our approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight policy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable beta distribution as well as a classifier network. The policy network is trained using the reinforce algorithm to generate image-specific noise masks that regularize the classifier during pretraining. A key aspect is that the policy network's role is limited to obtaining an intermediate (or heated) model before fine-tuning. During inference, the policy network is omitted, allowing direct comparison between the baseline and noise-regularized models. We conducted experiments and related analyses on RadImageNet datasets. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning the intermediate models consistently outperforms conventional training algorithms on both classification and generalization to unseen concept tasks. https://github.com/convergedmachine/Policy-Gradient-Driven-Noise-Mask</description>

      <title>PRIME: Blind Multispectral Unmixing Using Virtual Quantum Prism and Convex Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multispectral unmixing (MU) is critical due to the inevitable mixed pixel phenomenon caused by the limited spatial resolution of typical multispectral images in remote sensing. However, MU mathematically corresponds to the underdetermined blind source separation problem, thus highly challenging, preventing researchers from tackling it. Previous MU works all ignore the underdetermined issue, and merely consider scenarios with more bands than sources. This work attempts to resolve the underdetermined issue by further conducting the light-splitting task using a network-inspired virtual prism, and as this task is challenging, we achieve so by incorporating the very advanced quantum feature extraction techniques. We emphasize that the prism is virtual (allowing us to fix the spectral response as a simple deterministic matrix), so the virtual hyperspectral image (HSI) it generates has no need to correspond to some real hyperspectral sensor; in other words, it is good enough as long as the virtual HSI satisfies some fundamental properties of light splitting (e.g., non-negativity and continuity). With the above virtual quantum prism, we know that the virtual HSI is expected to possess some desired simplex structure. This allows us to adopt the convex geometry to unmix the spectra, followed by downsampling the pure spectra back to the multispectral domain, thereby achieving MU. Experimental evidence shows great potential of our MU algorithm, termed as prism-inspired multispectral endmember extraction (PRIME).</description>

      <title>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</description>

Abstract: Colonoscopy is currently one of the most sensitive screening methods for colorectal cancer. This study investigates the frontiers of intelligent colonoscopy techniques and their prospective implications for multimodal medical applications. With this goal, we begin by assessing the current data-centric and model-centric landscapes through four tasks for colonoscopic scene perception, including classification, detection, segmentation, and vision-language understanding. This assessment enables us to identify domain-specific challenges and reveals that multimodal research in colonoscopy remains open for further exploration. To embrace the coming multimodal era, we establish three foundational initiatives: a large-scale multimodal instruction tuning dataset ColonINST, a colonoscopy-designed multimodal language model ColonGPT, and a multimodal benchmark. To facilitate ongoing monitoring of this rapidly evolving field, we provide a public website for the latest updates: https://github.com/ai4colonoscopy/IntelliScope.</description>

      <title>On Disentangled Training for Nonlinear Transform in Learned Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated superior rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared to traditional codecs, but is challenged by training inefficiency that could incur more than two weeks to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch. Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, i.e., feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for uneven energy modulation. AuxT is lightweight and plug-and-play to be integrated into diverse LIC models to address the slow convergence issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate training of LIC models by 2 times and simultaneously achieves an average 1\% BD-rate reduction. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first successful attempt that can significantly improve the convergence of LIC with comparable or superior rate-distortion performance.

Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death in children, underscoring the need for early and accurate detection. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. This ensemble model integrates two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, selected for their balance of computational efficiency and accuracy. These models were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset and combined to enhance classification performance. Our proposed ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.63%, significantly outperforming individual models such as MobileNetV2 (97.10%) and NASNetMobile(96.25%) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed lightweight ensemble model presents a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for pneumonia detection, making it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</description>

Abstract: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO$_2$) is an essential indicator of respiratory functionality and is receiving increasing attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to have significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of cameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$ using videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They require a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to capture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose the first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation scheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a participant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and comfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on. We design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological models for SpO$_2$ measurement and demonstrate the explainability by visualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$ measurement, showing the potential of our proposed method to contribute to public health. We also analyze the impact of skin type and the side of a hand on SpO$_2$ estimation performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the problem of selecting a small set of linear measurements for reconstructing high-dimensional signals. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (generally known as a "diffusion model"). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection using deep learning have significantly improved accuracy and speed, yet effectively detecting small objects in complex backgrounds with fewer parameters remains a challenge. This letter introduces RSNet, a lightweight framework constructed to enhance ship detection in SAR imagery. To ensure accuracy with fewer parameters, we proposed Waveletpool-ContextGuided (WCG) as its backbone, guiding global context understanding through multi-scale wavelet features for effective detection in complex scenes. Additionally, Waveletpool-StarFusion (WSF) is introduced as the neck, employing a residual wavelet element-wise multiplication structure to achieve higher dimensional nonlinear features without increasing network width. The Lightweight-Shared (LS) module is designed as detect components to achieve efficient detection through lightweight shared convolutional structure and multi-format compatibility. Experiments on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and High-Resolution SAR Image Dataset (HRSID) demonstrate that RSNet achieves a strong balance between lightweight design and detection performance, surpassing many state-of-the-art detectors, reaching 72.5\% and 67.6\% in \textbf{\(\mathbf{mAP_{.50:.95}}\) }respectively with 1.49M parameters. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for segmenting pediatric brain tumors using a deep learning architecture, inspired by expert radiologists' segmentation strategies. Our model delineates four distinct tumor labels and is benchmarked on a held-out PED BraTS 2024 test set (i.e., pediatric brain tumor datasets introduced by BraTS). Furthermore, we evaluate our model's performance against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model using a new external dataset of 30 patients from CBTN (Children's Brain Tumor Network), labeled in accordance with the PED BraTS 2024 guidelines and 2023 BraTS Adult Glioma dataset. We compare segmentation outcomes with the winning algorithm from the PED BraTS 2023 challenge as the SOTA model. Our proposed algorithm achieved an average Dice score of 0.642 and an HD95 of 73.0 mm on the CBTN test data, outperforming the SOTA model, which achieved a Dice score of 0.626 and an HD95 of 84.0 mm. Moreover, our model exhibits strong generalizability, attaining a 0.877 Dice score in whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma dataset, surpassing existing SOTA. Our results indicate that the proposed model is a step towards providing more accurate segmentation for pediatric brain tumors, which is essential for evaluating therapy response and monitoring patient progress.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

Abstract: Brain decoding has emerged as a rapidly advancing and extensively utilized technique within neuroscience. This paper centers on the application of raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for decoding human brain activity, offering a more expedited and efficient methodology for enhancing our understanding of the human brain. The investigation specifically scrutinizes the efficacy of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in deciphering neural signals associated with speech production, with particular emphasis on the impact of vocabulary size, electrode density, and training data on the framework's performance. The study reveals the competitive word error rates (WERs) achievable on the Librispeech benchmark through pre-training on unlabelled data for speech processing. Furthermore, the study evaluates the efficacy of voice recognition under configurations with limited labeled data, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques while utilizing significantly fewer labels. Additionally, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of error patterns in voice recognition and the influence of model size and unlabelled training data. It underscores the significance of factors such as vocabulary size and electrode density in enhancing BCI performance, advocating for an increase in microelectrodes and refinement of language models.</description>
