      <title>Disentangling morphology and conductance in amorphous graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous graphene or amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) is a family of carbon films that exhibit a surprising sensitivity of electronic conductance to morphology. We combine deep learning-enhanced simulation techniques with percolation theory to analyze three morphologically distinct mesoscale AMCs. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of applying periodic boundary conditions to these fundamentally aperiodic systems or equating crystalline inclusions with conducting sites. We reproduce the previously reported dependence of charge conductance on morphology and explore the limitations of partial morphology descriptors in witnessing conductance properties. Finally, we perform crystallinity analysis of conductance networks along the electronic energy spectrum and show that they metamorphose from being localized on crystallites at band edges to localized on defects around the Fermi energy opening the possibility of control through gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>

      <title>The joint distribution of first return times and of the number of distinct sites visited by a 1D random walk before returning to the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</description>

      <title>Enhanced localization in the prethermal regime of continuously measured many-body localized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localized systems exhibit a unique characteristic of avoiding thermalization, primarily attributed to the presence of a local disorder potential in the Hamiltonian. In recent years there has been an interest in simulating these systems on quantum devices. However, actual quantum devices are subject to unavoidable decoherence that can be modeled as coupling to a bath or continuous measurements. The quantum Zeno effect is also known to inhibit thermalization in a quantum system, where repeated measurements suppress transport. In this work we study the interplay of many-body localization and the many-body quantum Zeno effect. In a prethermal regime, we find that signatures of many-body localization are enhanced when the system is coupled to a bath that contains measurements of local fermion population, subject to the appropriate choice of system and bath parameters.</description>

      <title>Hyperoptimized approximate contraction of tensor networks for rugged-energy-landscape spin glasses on periodic square and cubic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining the low-energy configurations of spin glasses that have rugged energy landscapes is of direct relevance to combinatorial optimization and fundamental science. Search-based heuristics have difficulty with this task due to the existence of many local minima that are far from optimal. The work of [M. M. Rams et al., Phys. Rev. E 104, 025308 (2021)] demonstrates an alternative that can bypass this issue for spin glasses with planar or quasi-planar geometry: sampling the Boltzmann distribution via approximate contractions of tensor networks. The computational complexity of this approach is due only to the complexity of contracting the network, and is therefore independent of landscape ruggedness. Here we initiate an investigation of how to take this approach beyond (quasi-)planar geometry by utilizing hyperoptimized approximate contraction of tensor networks [J. Gray and G. K.-L. Chan, Phys. Rev. X 14, 011009 (2024)]. We perform tests on the periodic square- and cubic-lattice, planted-solution Ising spin glasses generated with tile planting [F. Hamze et al., Phys. Rev. E 97, 043303 (2018)] for up to 2304 (square lattice) and 216 (cubic lattice) spins. For a fixed bond dimension, the time complexity is quadratic. With a bond dimension of only four, over the tested system sizes the average relative energy error in the most rugged instance class remains at ~1% (square lattice) or ~10% (cubic lattice) of optimal. In less rugged instances the solution is always optimal for the square lattice and either optimal or within ~1% for the cubic lattice. These results suggest that further development of optimization methods based on tensor-network representations of spin glass partition functions may be fruitful, especially given that such methods are not limited to the Ising (i.e., binary) or two-body (i.e., quadratic) settings.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and Hyperuniformity in Quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard Models with and without Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of local superfluid amplitude and boson density. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a significant increase of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. The order metric clarifies if the distribution of a physical quantity reflects the point distribution or not, and quantifies how complex the distribution is in comparison with the point distribution. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <title>Ballistic conductance with and without disorder in a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on Google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of macroscopic dynamics by fine-grained disorder in many-species ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large systems are often coarse-grained in order to study their low-dimensional macroscopic dynamics, yet microscopic complexity can in principle disrupt these predictions in many ways. We first consider one form of fine-grained complexity, heterogeneity in the time scales of microscopic dynamics, and show by an algebraic approach that it can stabilize macroscopic degrees of freedom. We then show that this time scale heterogeneity can arise from other forms of complexity, in particular disordered interactions between microscopic variables, and that it can drive the system's coarse-grained dynamics to transition from nonequilibrium attractors to fixed points. These mechanisms are demonstrated in a model of many-species ecosystems, where we find a quasi-decoupling between the low- and high-dimensional facets of the dynamics, interacting only through a key feature of ecological models, the fact that species' dynamical time scales are controlled by their abundances. We conclude that fine-grained disorder may enable a macroscopic equilibrium description of many-species ecosystems.</description>
