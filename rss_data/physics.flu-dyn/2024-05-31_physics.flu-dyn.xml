      <title>On the closure of curvature in 2D flamelet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far, flamelet theory has treated curvature as an independent parameter requiring specific means for closure. In this work, it is shown how the adoption of a two-dimensional orthogonal composition space allows obtaining formal mathematical relations between the flame curvatures and the gradients of the conditioning scalars (also called flamelet coordinates). With these, both curvatures become a flame response to the underlying flow, which conveniently allows removing them from the corresponding set of flamelet equations. While the demonstration is performed in the context of partially premixed flames, the approach is general and applicable to any orthogonal coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a real 3D stationary flow characterized by chaotic advection generated by a magnetic field created by permanent magnets acting on a weakly conductive fluid subjected to a weak constant current. The model under consideration involves the Stokes equations for viscous incompressible fluid at low Reynolds number in which the density forces correspond to the Lorentz force generated by the magnetic field of the magnets and the electric current through the fluid. An innovative numerical approach based on a mixed finite element method has been developed and implemented for computing the flow velocity fields with the electromagnetic force. This ensures highly accurate numerical results, allowing a detailed analysis of the chaotic behavior of fluid trajectories through the computations of associated Poincar\'e sections and Lyapunov exponents. Subsequently, an examination of mixing efficiency is conducted, employing computations of contamination and homogeneity rates, as well as mixing time. The obtained results underscore the relevance of the modeling and computational tools employed, as well as the design of the magnetohydrodynamic device used.</description>

      <title>Spectral adjoint-based assimilation of sparse data in unsteady simulations of turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The URANS equations provide a computationally efficient tool to simulate unsteady turbulent flows for a wide range of applications. To account for the errors introduced by the turbulence closure model, recent works have adopted data assimilation (DA) to enhance their predictive capabilities. Recognizing the challenges posed by the computational cost of 4DVar DA for unsteady flows, we propose a 3DVar DA framework that incorporates a time-discrete Fourier transform of the URANS equations, facilitating the use of the stationary discrete adjoint method in Fourier space.
  Central to our methodology is the introduction of a corrective, divergence-free, and unsteady forcing term, derived from a Fourier series expansion, into the URANS equations. This term aims at mitigating discrepancies in the modeled divergence of Reynolds stresses, allowing for the tuning of stationary parameters across different Fourier modes.
  Our implementation is built upon an extended version of the coupled URANS solver in OpenFOAM, enhanced to compute adjoint variables and gradients. This design choice ensures straightforward applicability to various flow setups and solvers, eliminating the need for specialized harmonic solvers. A gradient-based optimizer is employed to minimize discrepancies between simulated results and sparse velocity reference data.
  The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through its application to flow around a two-dimensional circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 3900. Our results highlight the method's ability to reconstruct mean flow accurately and improve the vortex shedding frequency through the assimilation of zeroth mode data. Additionally, the assimilation of first mode data further enhances the simulation's capability to capture low-frequency dynamics of the flow, and finally, it runs efficiently by leveraging a coarse mesh.</description>

      <title>Shock Wave Formation in Radiative Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temporal evolution of weak shocks in radiative media is theoretically investigated in this work. The structure of radiative shocks has traditionally been studied in a stationary framework. Their systematic classification is complex because layers of optically thin and thick regions alternate to form a radiatively-driven precursor and a temperature-relaxation layer, between which the hydrodynamic shock is embedded. In this work, we analyze the formation of weak shocks when two radiative plasmas with different pressures are put in contact. Applying a reductive perturbative method yields a Burgers-type equation that governs the temporal evolution of the perturbed variables including the radiation field. The conditions upon which optically thin and thick solutions exist have been derived and expressed as a function of the shock strength and Boltzmann number. Below a certain Boltzmann number threshold, weak shocks always become optically thick asymptotically in time, while thin solutions appear as transitory structures. The existence of an optically thin regime is related to the presence of an overdense layer in the compressed material. Scaling laws for the characteristic formation time and shock width are provided for each regime. The theoretical analysis is supported by FLASH simulations, and a comprehensive test-case has been designed to benchmark radiative hydrodynamic codes.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A Monotonic, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian Tracer Transport Scheme for Flow with Large Courant Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local conservation of mass and entropy are becoming increasingly desirable properties for modern numerical weather and climate models. This work presents a Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme, called SWIFT, that facilitates this conservation for tracer variables, whilst maintaining other vital properties such as preservation of a constant, monotonicity and positivity. Importantly, these properties all hold for large Courant numbers and multi-dimensional flow, making the scheme appropriate for use within a dynamical core which takes large time steps.
  The SWIFT scheme presented here can be seen as an evolution of the FFSL methods of Leonard et al and Lin and Rood. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes consist of a splitting into a sequence of one-dimensional calculations. The new SWIFT splitting presented here allows monotonic and positivity properties from the one-dimensional calculations to be inherited by the multi-dimensional scheme. These one-dimensional calculations involve separating the mass flux into terms that correspond to integer and fractional parts of the Courant number. Key to achieving conservation is coupling the transport of tracers to the transport of the fluid density, through re-use of the discrete mass flux that was calculated from the fluid density in the transport of the tracers. This work also describes how these properties can still be attained when the tracer is vertically-staggered from the density in a Charney-Phillips grid.</description>

      <title>Flexible SE(2) graph neural networks with applications to PDE surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for constructing graph neural networks equivariant to 2D rotations and translations and leveraging them as PDE surrogates on non-gridded domains. We show that aligning the representations with the principal axis allows us to sidestep many constraints while preserving SE(2) equivariance. By applying our model as a surrogate for fluid flow simulations and conducting thorough benchmarks against non-equivariant models, we demonstrate significant gains in terms of both data efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>A segregated reduced order model of a pressure-based solver for turbulent compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a reduced-order modelling framework for turbulent compressible flows discretized by the use of finite volume approaches. The basic idea behind this work is the construction of a reduced-order model capable of providing closely accurate solutions with respect to the high fidelity flow fields. Full-order solutions are often obtained through the use of segregated solvers (solution variables are solved one after another), employing slightly modified conservation laws so that they can be decoupled and then solved one at a time. Classical reduction architectures, on the contrary, rely on the Galerkin projection of a complete Navier-Stokes system to be projected all at once, causing a mild discrepancy with the high order solutions. This article relies on segregated reduced-order algorithms for the resolution of turbulent and compressible flows in the context of physical and geometrical parameters. At the full-order level turbulence is modeled using an eddy viscosity approach. Since there is a variety of different turbulence models for the approximation of this supplementary viscosity, one of the aims of this work is to provide a reduced-order model which is independent on this selection. This goal is reached by the application of hybrid methods where Navier-Stokes equations are projected in a standard way while the viscosity field is approximated by the use of data-driven interpolation methods or by the evaluation of a properly trained neural network. By exploiting the aforementioned expedients it is possible to predict accurate solutions with respect to the full-order problems characterized by high Reynolds numbers and elevated Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>Characteristic time of transient response of solid oxide cells (SOCs) to changes in voltage/current: from theory to applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intermittency of solar and wind power can be addressed by integrating them with Solid Oxide Cells (SOCs). This study delves into the transient characteristics of SOCs and their dependence on dynamic heat and mass transfer processes. Non-dimensional analysis was used to identify influential parameters, followed by a 3-D numerical simulation-based parametric analysis to examine the dynamic gaseous and thermal responses of SOCs with varying dimensions, material properties, and operating conditions. For the first time, we proposed characteristic times to describe the relationship between SOC transients and multiple parameters. These characteristic times represent the overall heat and mass transfer rats in SOCs. Their effectiveness was validated against literature and demonstrated potential in characterizing the transient characteristics of other electrochemical cells. Besides, two examples are provided to illustrate how the characteristic times facilitate SOC design and control at minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>A note on the error analysis of data-driven closure models for large eddy simulations of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a mathematical formulation for error propagation in flow trajectory prediction using data-driven turbulence closure modeling. Under the assumption that the predicted state of a large eddy simulation prediction must be close to that of a subsampled direct numerical simulation, we retrieve an upper bound for the prediction error when utilizing a data-driven closure model. We also demonstrate that this error is significantly affected by the time step size and the Jacobian which play a role in amplifying the initial one-step error made by using the closure. Our analysis also shows that the error propagates exponentially with rollout time and the upper bound of the system Jacobian which is itself influenced by the Jacobian of the closure formulation. These findings could enable the development of new regularization techniques for ML models based on the identified error-bound terms, improving their robustness and reducing error propagation.</description>

      <title>Unraveling friction forces of droplets on a non-wetting surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the friction forces encountered by droplets on non-wetting surfaces, specifically focusing on superhydrophobic and superheated substrates. Employing a combination of experimental techniques, including inclined plane tests and cantilever force sensor measurements, we quantify friction forces across a broad range of velocities and surface types. Our results demonstrate that friction forces vary significantly with changes in droplet velocity and surface characteristics, transitioning from contact line pinning to viscous dissipation in the bulk of the droplet. We propose a universal scaling law that accounts for contact angle hysteresis, viscous dissipation, and aerodynamic drag, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding droplet dynamics on non-wetting surfaces. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing surface designs in fluid transport and microfluidic applications, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and innovation in these technologies.</description>

      <title>The geometry of maximal development and shock formation for the Euler equations in multiple space dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a fundamental piece of the boundary of the maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD) of Cauchy data for the multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations, which is necessary for the local shock development problem. For an open set of compressive and generic $H^7$ initial data, we construct unique $H^7$ solutions to the Euler equations in the maximal spacetime region below a given time-slice, beyond the time of the first singularity; at any point in this spacetime, the solution can be smoothly and uniquely computed by tracing both the fast and slow acoustic characteristic surfaces backward-in-time, until reaching the Cauchy data prescribed along the initial time-slice. The future temporal boundary of this spacetime region is a singular hypersurface, containing the union of three sets: first, a co-dimension-$2$ surface of ``first singularities'' called the pre-shock; second, a downstream hypersurface called the singular set emanating from the pre-shock, on which the Euler solution experiences a continuum of gradient catastrophes; third, an upstream hypersurface consisting of a Cauchy horizon emanating from the pre-shock, which the Euler solution cannot reach. We develop a new geometric framework for the description of the acoustic characteristic surfaces which is based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework, and combine this with a new type of differentiated Riemann variables which are linear combinations of gradients of velocity, sound speed, and the curvature of the fast acoustic characteristic surfaces. With these new variables, we establish uniform $H^7$ Sobolev bounds for solutions to the Euler equations without derivative loss and with optimal regularity.</description>

      <title>DeepLag: Discovering Deep Lagrangian Dynamics for Intuitive Fluid Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the future fluid is vital to extensive areas such as meteorology, oceanology, and aerodynamics. However, since the fluid is usually observed from an Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are seriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges to the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined paradigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting the future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover hidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid by tracking the movements of adaptively sampled key particles. DeepLag utilizes the proposed where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is inferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics information is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide future prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a transparent and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model free from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better efficiency. Experimentally, DeepLag excels in three challenging fluid prediction tasks covering 2D and 3D, simulated and real-world fluids.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>
