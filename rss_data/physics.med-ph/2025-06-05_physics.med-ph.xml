      <title>Analytical Reconstruction of Periodically Deformed Objects in Time-resolved CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved CT is an advanced measurement technique that has been widely used to observe dynamic objects, including periodically varying structures such as hearts, lungs, or hearing structures. To reconstruct these objects from CT projections, a common approach is to divide the projections into several collections based on their motion phases and perform reconstruction within each collection, assuming they originate from a static object. This describes the gating-based method, which is the standard approach for time-periodic reconstruction. However, the gating-based reconstruction algorithm only utilizes a limited subset of projections within each collection and ignores the correlation between different collections, leading to inefficient use of the radiation dose. To address this issue, we propose two analytical reconstruction pipelines in this paper, and validate them with experimental data captured using tomographic synchrotron microscopy. We demonstrate that our approaches significantly reduce random noise in the reconstructed images without blurring the sharp features of the observed objects. Equivalently, our methods can achieve the same reconstruction quality as gating-based methods but with a lower radiation dose. Our code is available at github.com/PeriodRecon.</description>

      <title>Personalized MR-Informed Diffusion Models for 3D PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown improved lesion detectability and flexibility to reconstruction hyperparameters (e.g. scanner geometry or dose level) when PET images are reconstructed by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. Such methods train a diffusion model (without sinogram data) on high-quality, but still noisy, PET images. In this work, we propose a simple method for generating subject-specific PET images from a dataset of multi-subject PET-MR scans, synthesizing "pseudo-PET" images by transforming between different patients' anatomy using image registration. The images we synthesize retain information from the subject's MR scan, leading to higher resolution and the retention of anatomical features compared to the original set of PET images. With simulated and real [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets, we show that pre-training a personalized diffusion model with subject-specific "pseudo-PET" images improves reconstruction accuracy with low-count data. In particular, the method shows promise in combining information from a guidance MR scan without overly imposing anatomical features, demonstrating an improved trade-off between reconstructing PET-unique image features versus features present in both PET and MR. We believe this approach for generating and utilizing synthetic data has further applications to medical imaging tasks, particularly because patient-specific PET images can be generated without resorting to generative deep learning or large training datasets.</description>

      <title>Impact of friction force and retrieval speed on in silico mechanical thrombectomies: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) is a widely accepted first-line treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) and it has been studied using in vitro and in silico models. Thrombectomy outcomes have been performed for patient-specific cases using in silico models. However, until now, in vivo friction coefficients for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions are unknown, but in vitro experiments have been attempted with significant standard deviations. These interactions and friction coefficients have been considered an important aspect of thrombectomy success. Objectives: In the current study, we explored the influence of variation in friction forces for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions using virtual mechanical thrombectomy (VMT). We have performed three simulations for each interaction and varied friction coefficients around the standard deviation observed in the past in vitro studies. Results: (i) clot-vessel friction: higher friction leads to clot fragmentation and VMT failure. (ii) stent-clot friction: it is susceptible to VMT outcomes, with lower values showing the slippage of the clot while higher values lead to fragmentation. (iii) stent-vessel friction: higher friction shows compression of the stent in curved vessels and dislodgment of clot from stent retriever (SR) due to its compression, which leads to VMT failure. (iv) retrieval speed (RS): higher RS (&gt;30 mm/s) leads to significant stent compression and unrealistic behavior of the SR. Conclusions: Analysis of results proposes the necessity for calculating accurate friction factor values and their implementation into in silico models, due to their sensitivity towards thrombectomy outcomes. Such in silico models mimic in vivo thrombectomy more closely and can be used in mechanical thrombectomy planning, management, and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Edge Computing for Physics-Driven AI in Computational MRI: A Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-driven artificial intelligence (PD-AI) reconstruction methods have emerged as the state-of-the-art for accelerating MRI scans, enabling higher spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the high resolution of these scans generates massive data volumes, leading to challenges in transmission, storage, and real-time processing. This is particularly pronounced in functional MRI, where hundreds of volumetric acquisitions further exacerbate these demands. Edge computing with FPGAs presents a promising solution for enabling PD-AI reconstruction near the MRI sensors, reducing data transfer and storage bottlenecks. However, this requires optimization of PD-AI models for hardware efficiency through quantization and bypassing traditional FFT-based approaches, which can be a limitation due to their computational demands. In this work, we propose a novel PD-AI computational MRI approach optimized for FPGA-based edge computing devices, leveraging 8-bit complex data quantization and eliminating redundant FFT/IFFT operations. Our results show that this strategy improves computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to conventional PD-AI methods, and outperforms standard clinical methods. Our approach presents an opportunity for high-resolution MRI reconstruction on resource-constrained devices, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>A combined Machine Learning and Finite Element Modelling tool for the surgical planning of craniosynostosis correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Craniosynostosis is a medical condition that affects the growth of babies' heads, caused by an early fusion of cranial sutures. In recent decades, surgical treatments for craniosynostosis have significantly improved, leading to reduced invasiveness, faster recovery, and less blood loss. At Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with sagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC). This procedure involves a 15x15 mm2 osteotomy, where two springs are inserted to induce distraction. Despite the numerous advantages of this surgical technique for patients, the outcome remains unpredictable due to the lack of efficient preoperative planning tools. The surgeon's experience and the baby's age are currently relied upon to determine the osteotomy location and spring selection. Previous tools for predicting the surgical outcome of SC relied on finite element modeling (FEM), which involved computed tomography (CT) imaging and required engineering expertise and lengthy calculations. The main goal of this research is to develop a real-time prediction tool for the surgical outcome of patients, eliminating the need for CT scans to minimise radiation exposure during preoperative planning. The proposed methodology involves creating personalised synthetic skulls based on three-dimensional (3D) photographs, incorporating population average values of suture location, skull thickness, and soft tissue properties. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is employed to achieve the desired surgical outcome. The resulting multi-output support vector regressor model achieves a R2 metric of 0.95 and MSE and MAE below 0.13. Furthermore, in the future, this model could not only simulate various surgical scenarios but also provide optimal parameters for achieving a maximum cranial index (CI).</description>

      <title>Discrete Element Parameter Calibration of Livestock Salt Based on Particle Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to obtain accurate contact parameters for the discrete element simulation of salt particles used in animal husbandry, the principle of particle contact scaling and dimensional analysis were used for particle scaling. Firstly, the Plackett Burman experiment was used to screen the parameters that significantly affect the angle of repose: salt salt rolling friction coefficient, salt salt recovery coefficient, and salt steel rolling friction coefficient. Considering the influence of other parameters, a combination of bench and simulation experiments was used to calibrate the contact parameters between salt particles and steel plates used in animal husbandry in EDEM. Finally, through the stacking test, steepest climbing test, and orthogonal rotation combination test, the salt salt rolling friction coefficient was obtained to be 0.23, the salt salt recovery coefficient was 0.544, and the salt steel rolling friction coefficient was 0.368, which were verified through bench tests. The experimental results show that the relative error between the actual value of the stacking angle and the simulation results is 0.6%. The results indicate that the calibrated contact parameters can be used for discrete element simulation of salt particles for animal husbandry, providing reference for the design of quantitative feeding screws and silos.</description>

      <title>Two-stage deep learning framework for the restoration of incomplete-ring PET images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important molecular imaging tool widely used in medicine. Traditional PET systems rely on complete detector rings for full angular coverage and reliable data collection. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. Standard reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation with these systems because of reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. We present a two-stage deep-learning framework that, without incorporating any time-of-flight (TOF) information, restores high-quality images from data with about 50% missing coincidences - double the loss levels previously addressed by CNN-based methods. The pipeline operates in two stages: a projection-domain Attention U-Net first predicts the missing sections of the sinogram by leveraging spatial context from neighbouring slices, after which the completed data are reconstructed with OSEM algorithm and passed to a U-Net-diffusion module that removes residual artefacts while reinstating high-frequency detail. Using 206 brain volumes from a public dataset, the result shows that our model successfully preserves most anatomical structures and tracer distribution features with PSNR of 30.92 dB and SSIM of 0.9708. We also achieve higher inference speed, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.</description>
