      <title>Applications of equidistant supporting surfaces of a convex body in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hyperplane $H$ supporting a convex body $C$ in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$ we define the width of $C$ determined by $H$ as the distance between $H$ and a most distant ultraparallel hyperplane supporting $C$. The thickness (i.e., the minimum width) of $C$ is denoted by $\Delta(C)$. A convex body $R \subset \mathbb{H}^d$ is called reduced if for every body $Z \subsetneq R$ we have $\Delta(Z) &lt; \Delta(R)$. We show that for any extreme point $e$ of a reduced body $R \subset \mathbb{H}^d$ there exists a supporting hyperplane $H$ of $R$ which passes through $e$ or its equidistant surface supporting $R$ passes through $e$. Bodies of constant width in $\mathbb{H}^d$ are defined as bodies whose all widths are equal. We prove that every complete body in $\mathbb{H}^d$ is a body of constant width.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups and group presentations with bounded relator lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.08827v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry of compact geodesic spaces with trivial first Betti number admitting large finite groups of isometries. We show that if a finite group $G$ acts by isometries on a compact geodesic space $X$ whose first Betti number vanishes, then diam$(X) / $diam$(X / G ) \leq 4 \sqrt{ \vert G \vert }$.
  For a group $G$ and a finite symmetric generating set $S$, $P_k(\Gamma (G, S))$ denotes the 2-dimensional CW-complex whose 1-skeleton is the Cayley graph $\Gamma$ of $G$ with respect to $S$ and whose 2-cells are $m$-gons for $0 \leq m \leq k$, defined by the simple graph loops of length $m$ in $\Gamma$, up to cyclic permutations.
  Let $G$ be a finite abelian group with $\vert G \vert \geq 3$ and $S$ a symmetric set of generators for which $P_k(\Gamma (G,S))$ has trivial first Betti number. We show that the first nontrivial eigenvalue $-\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian on the Cayley graph satisfies $\lambda_1 \geq 2 - 2 \cos ( 2 \pi / k ) $. We also give an explicit upper bound on the diameter of the Cayley graph of $G$ with respect to $S$ of the form $O (k^2 \vert S \vert \log \vert G \vert )$. Related explicit bounds for the Cheeger constant and Kazhdan constant of the pair $(G,S)$ are also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12191v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present developments in the theory of Korevaar-Schoen-Sobolev spaces on metric measure spaces. While this theory coincides with those of Cheeger and Shanmugalingam if the space is doubling and satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality, it offers new perspectives in the context of fractals for which the approach by weak upper gradients is inadequate.</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz arcs in metric spaces with controlled geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize a bi-Lipschitz extension result of David and Semmes from Euclidean spaces to complete metric measure spaces with controlled geometry (Ahlfors regularity and supporting a Poincar\'e inequality). In particular, we find sharp conditions on metric measure spaces $X$ so that any bi-Lipschitz embedding of a subset of the real line into $X$ extends to a bi-Lipschitz embedding of the whole line. Along the way, we prove that if the complement of an open subset $Y$ of $X$ has small Assouad dimension, then it is a uniform domain. Finally, we prove a quantitative approximation of continua in $X$ by bi-Lipschitz curves.</description>

      <title>Localization for coarse homology theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.04947v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Bredon-style equivariant coarse homology theory. We show that such a Bredon-style equivariant coarse homology theory satisfies localization theorems and that a general equivariant coarse homology theory can be approximated by a Bredon-style version. We discuss the special case of algebraic and topological equivariant coarse $K$-homology and obtain the coarse analog of Segal's localization theorem.</description>

      <title>Controlled objects in left-exact $\infty$-categories and the Novikov conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.02338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate to every $G$-bornological coarse space $X$ and every left-exact $\infty$-category with $G$-action a left-exact infinity-category of equivariant $X$-controlled objects. Postcomposing with algebraic K-theory leads to {new} equivariant coarse homology theories. This allows us to apply the injectivity results for assembly maps by Bunke, Engel, Kasprowski and Winges to the algebraic K-theory of left-exact $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of infinitely generated attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.15133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dimension theory of limit sets of iterated function systems consisting of a countably infinite number of contractions. Our primary focus is on the intermediate dimensions: a family of dimensions depending on a parameter $\theta \in [0,1]$ which interpolate between the Hausdorff and box dimensions. Our main results are in the case when all the contractions are conformal. Under a natural separation condition we prove that the intermediate dimensions of the limit set are the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and the intermediate dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. This builds on work of Mauldin and Urba\'nski concerning the Hausdorff and upper box dimension. We give several (often counter-intuitive) applications of our work to dimensions of projections, fractional Brownian images, and general H\"older images. These applications apply to well-studied examples such as sets of numbers which have real or complex continued fraction expansions with restricted entries.
  We also obtain several results without assuming conformality or any separation conditions. We prove general upper bounds for the Hausdorff, box and intermediate dimensions of infinitely generated attractors in terms of a topological pressure function. We also show that the limit set of a 'generic' infinite iterated function system has box and intermediate dimensions equal to the ambient spatial dimension, where 'generic' can mean either 'full measure' or 'comeagre.'</description>

      <title>Assouad type dimensions of infinitely generated self-conformal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dimension theory of limit sets of iterated function systems consisting of a countably infinite number of conformal contractions. Our focus is on the Assouad type dimensions, which give information about the local structure of sets. Under natural separation conditions, we prove a formula for the Assouad dimension and prove sharp bounds for the Assouad spectrum in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. The Assouad spectra of the family of examples which we use to show that the bounds are sharp display interesting behaviour, such as having two phase transitions. Our results apply in particular to sets of real or complex numbers which have continued fraction expansions with restricted entries, and to certain parabolic attractors.</description>

      <title>Apollonian carpets and the boundary of the Kahler cone of a hyperkahler manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ample cone of a compact Kahler $n$-manifold $M$ is the intersection of its Kahler cone and the real subspace generated by integer (1,1)-classes. Its isotropic boundary is the set of all points $\eta$ on its boundary such that $\int_M \eta^n=0$. We are interested in the relation between the shape of the isotropic boundary of the ample cone of a hyperkahler manifold and the dynamics of its holomorphic automorphism group $G$. In this case, the projectivization of the ample cone is realized as an open, locally polyhedral subset in a hyperbolic space $H$. The isotropic boundary $S$ is realized as a subset of the hyperbolic boundary (the absolute) $A$ of $H$, which is naturally identified with a Euclidean sphere. It is clear that the isotropic boundary $S$ contains the limit set of $G$ acting on its ample cone. We prove that, conversely, all irrational points on $S$ belong to the limit set. Using a result of N. Shah about limiting distributions of curves under geodesic flow on hyperbolic manifolds, we prove that every real analytic curve in $S$ is contained in a geodesic sphere in $S$,and in presence of such curves the limit set is the closure of the union of these geodesic spheres. We study the geometry of such fractal sets, called Apollonian carpets, and establish the link between the Apollonian carpet and the structure of the automorphism group.</description>
