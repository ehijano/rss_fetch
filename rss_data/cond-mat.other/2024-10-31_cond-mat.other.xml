      <title>Zero-point energy of tensor fluctuations on the MPS manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a method for studying low-energy physics in highly correlated magnetic systems using the matrix product state (MPS) manifold. We adapt the spin-wave approach, which has been very successful in modeling certain low-entanglement magnetic materials, to systems where the ground state is better represented by an MPS, such as the S = 1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model. We argue that the quasi-local action of tensor fluctuations and the natural K\"ahler structure of the MPS manifold facilitate a description in terms of bosonic modes. We apply this approach to compute fluctuation corrections to the bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model, whose ground state we expect to be close to the exact bond dimension 2 AKLT state in a certain parameter range. Our results show significant improvements in energy approximations, highlighting both the qualitative and quantitative potential of this paradigm for studying complex entangled systems. This approach paves the way for new insights into the low-energy physics of correlated materials and the development of effective field theories beyond traditional semiclassical methods.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in Bethe-Salpeter, (screened) Hartree-Fock, Hybrid-DFT approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the large class of systems described via a time-dependent self-consistent mean field Hamiltonian including (screened) Hartree-Fock exchange, we demonstrate that any electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The proposed approach encompasses different levels of linear response theory, such as time-dependent DFT with hybrid functionals, time-dipendent Hartree-Fock, and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects, using a tight-binding model including exchange effects in the response. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Aubry transition with small distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that when the Aubry transition occurs in incommensurately distorted structures, the amplitude of the distortions is not necessarily large as suggested by the standard Frenkel-Kontorova mechanical model. By modifying the shape of the potential in such a way that the mechanical force is locally stronger (i.e. increasing the nonlinearities), the transition may occur at a small amplitude of the potential with small distortions. A "phason" gap then opens, while the phonon spectrum resembles a standard undistorted spectrum at higher energies. This may explain the existence of pinned phases with small distortions as experimentally observed in charge-density waves.</description>
