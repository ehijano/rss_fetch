      <title>Photoemission Spectroscopy on photoresist materials: A protocol for analysis of radiation sensitive materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device architectures and dimensions are now at an unimaginable level not thought possible even 10 years ago. The continued downscaling, following the so-called Moore's law, has motivated the development and use of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography scanners with specialized photoresists. Since the quality and precision of the transferred circuit pattern is determined by the EUV induced chemical changes in the photoresist, having a deep understanding of these chemical changes is of pivotal importance. For this purpose, several spectroscopic and material characterization techniques have already been employed so far. Among them, photoemission can be essential as it not only allows direct probing of chemical bonds in a quantitative way but also provides useful information regarding the generation and distribution of primary and secondary electrons. However, since high energy photons are being employed for characterization of a photosensitive material, modification of the sample during the measurement is possible and this must be considered when investigating the chemical changes in the photoresist before and after exposure to EUV light.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectra Using Second-Order M{\o}ller-Plesset Perturbation Theory and Configuration Interaction Doubles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first single-reference calculations of the atomic axial tensors (AATs) using wave-function-based methods including dynamic electron correlation effects using second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and configuration interaction doubles (CID). Our implementation involves computing the overlap of numerical derivatives of the correlated wave functions with respect to both nuclear displacement coordinates and the external magnetic field. Out test set included three small molecules, including the axially chiral hydrogen molecule dimer and (P)-hydrogen peroxide, and the achiral H2O. For our molecular test set, we observed deviations of the AATs for MP2 and CID from that of the Hartree-Fock (HF) method upwards of 49%, varying with the choice of basis set. For (P)-hydrogen peroxide, electron correlation effects on the VCD rotatory strengths and corresponding spectra were particularly significant, with maximum deviations of the rotatory strengths of 62% and 49% for MP2 and CID, respectively, using our largest basis set. The inclusion of dynamic electron correlation to the computation of the AATs can have a significant impact on the resulting rotatory strengths and VCD spectra.</description>

      <title>Bound-state relativistic quantum electrodynamics: a perspective for precision physics with atoms and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision physics aims to use atoms and molecules to test and develop the fundamental theory of matter, possibly beyond the Standard Model. Most of the atomic and molecular phenomena are described by the QED (quantum electrodynamics) sector of the Standard Model. Do we have the computational tools, algorithms, and practical equations for the most possible complete computation of atoms and molecules within the QED sector? What is the fundamental equation to start with? Is it still Schr\"odinger's wave equation for molecular matter, or is there anything beyond that? This paper provides a concise overview of the relativistic QED framework and recent numerical developments targeting precision physics and spectroscopy applications with common features with the robust and successful relativistic quantum chemistry methodology.</description>

      <title>Two stage decoherence of optical phonons in long oligomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intramolecular energy transport is generally responsible for chemical energy balance in molecular systems. The transport is fast and efficient if energy is transferred by optical phonons in periodic oligomers, but its efficiently is limited by decoherence emerging due to anharmonic interactions with acoustic phonons. We show that in the most common case of the optical phonon band being narrower than the acoustic bands decoherence takes place in two stages. The faster stage involves optical phonon multiple forward scattering due to absorption and emission of transverse acoustic phonons, i. e. collective bending modes with a quadratic spectrum; the transport remains ballistic and the speed can be altered. The subsequent slower stage involves phonon backscattering in multiphonon processes involving two or more acostic phonons resulting is a switch to diffusive transport. If the initially excited optical phonon possesses a relatively small group velocity, then its equilibration in the first stage is accompanied by its acceleration due to its transitions to states propagating faster. This theoretical expectation is consistent with the recent measurements of optical phonon transport in alkane chains, accelerating with increasing the chain length.</description>

      <title>Analytic gradients for equation-of-motion coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the process of molecular photoexcitation is crucial in various fields, including drug development, materials science, photovoltaics, and more. The electronic vertical excitation energy is a critical property, for example in determining the singlet-triplet gap of chromophores. However, a full understanding of excited-state processes requires additional explorations of the excited-state potential energy surface and electronic properties, which is greatly aided by the availability of analytic energy gradients. Owing to its robust high accuracy over a wide range of chemical problems, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) is a powerful method for predicting excited state properties, and the implementation of analytic gradients of many EOM-CCSD (excitation energies, ionization potentials, electron attachment energies, etc.) along with numerous successful applications highlights the flexibility of the method. In specific cases where a higher level of accuracy is needed or in more complex electronic structures, the inclusion of triple excitations becomes essential, for example, in the EOM-CCSD* approach of Saeh and Stanton. In this work, we derive and implement for the first time the analytic gradients of EOMEE-CCSD*, which also provides a template for analytic gradients of related excited state methods with perturbative triple excitations. The capabilities of analytic EOMEE-CCSD* gradients are illustrated by several representative examples.</description>

      <title>Quantifying dissipation in stochastic complex oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations-driven complex oscillations are experimentally observed in cellular systems such as hepatocytes, cardiac cells, neuronal cells, etc. These systems are generally operating in regimes far from thermodynamic equilibrium. To study nonequilibrium thermodynamic properties such as energy dissipation in stochastic complex oscillations, we consider stochastic modeling of two nonlinear biological oscillators, namely, the intracellular calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) oscillation model and the Hindmarsh-Rose model for neuronal dynamics. These models exhibit various types of complex oscillations like bursting and quasi-periodic oscillations for various system parameter values. In this work, we formulate open chemical reaction schemes for the two model systems driving the systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. We then analyze the steady-state total entropy production rate (EPR) in the various types of stochastic complex oscillations. Our results show higher values of steady-state total EPR in stochastic complex oscillations than simple periodic oscillations. Moreover, in the Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal model, we observe an order-to-disorder transition from periodic (organized) bursts of spikes to chaotic (unorganized) oscillations with distinct behaviors of steady-state total EPR. Our results reveal that stochastic complex oscillations are produced at the cost of higher energy consumption and that it requires a higher thermodynamic cost to maintain the periodic bursts than chaotic oscillations. Our findings indicate that complex cellular regulatory or signaling processes by Ca$^{2+}$ that help perform complex tasks of the nervous system or rich information coding by neurons involve a higher thermodynamic cost. The results deepen our understanding of energy dissipation in nonlinear, nonequilibrium biological systems with stochastic complex oscillatory dynamics.</description>

      <title>Accurate Prediction of Core Level Binding Energies from Ground-State Density Functional Calculations: The Importance of Localization and Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method for predicting core level binding energies (CLBEs) is developed by both localizing the core-level states and describing the screening effect. CLBEs contain important information about the electronic structure, elemental chemistry, and chemical environment of molecules and materials. Theoretical study of CLBEs can provide insights for analyzing and interpreting the experimental results obtained from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in which the overlapping of signals is very common. The localization of core-level holes is important for the theoretical calculation of CLBEs. Predicting CLBEs from commonly used density functional approximations (DFAs) is challenging, because conventional DFAs often produce delocalized core-level states, especially when degenerate core-level states exist. In this work, we combine the localization procedure from the localized orbital scaling correction method and the curvature matrix generalized from the exact second-order correction method that contains the screening effect, and the resulting approach can accurately predict CLBEs from ground-state density functional calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum nuclear dynamics on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum nuclear dynamics with wavepacket time-evolution is classically intractable and viewed as a promising avenue for quantum information processing. Here, we use an IonQ 11-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, Harmony, to study the quantum wavepacket dynamics of a shared-proton within a short-strong hydrogen-bonded system. We also provide the first application of distributed quantum computing for chemical dynamics problems, where the distributed set of quantum processes is constructed using a tensor network formalism. For a range of initial states, we experimentally drive the ion-trap system to emulate the quantum nuclear wavepacket as it evolves along the potential surface generated from electronic structure. Following the experimental creation of the nuclear wavepacket, we extract measurement observables such as its time-dependent spatial projection and its characteristic vibrational frequencies to good agreement with classical results. Vibrational eigenenergies obtained from quantum computational are in agreement with those obtained from classical simulations to within a fraction of a kcal/mol, thus suggesting chemical accuracy. Our approach opens a new paradigm for studying the quantum chemical dynamics and vibrational spectra of molecules and also provides the first demonstration for parallel quantum computation on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Accurate models for open quantum systems -- quantum states that have non-trivial interactions with their environment -- may aid in the advancement of a diverse array of fields, including quantum computation, informatics, and the prediction of static and dynamic molecular properties. In recent years, quantum algorithms have been leveraged for the computation of open quantum systems as the predicted quantum advantage of quantum devices over classical ones may allow previously inaccessible applications. Accomplishing this goal will require input and expertise from different research perspectives, as well as the training of a diverse quantum workforce, making a compilation of current quantum methods for treating open quantum systems both useful and timely. In this Review, we first provide a succinct summary of the fundamental theory of open quantum systems and then delve into a discussion on recent quantum algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of pertinent applications, demonstrating the applicability of this field to realistic chemical, biological, and material systems.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to incorporating intermolecular dispersion into the openCOSMO-RS model. Part 1: Halocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COSMO-RS (Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents) is a predictive thermodynamic model that has found diverse applications in various domains like chemical engineering, environmental chemistry, nanotechnology, material science, and biotechnology. Its core concept involves calculating the screening charge density on the surface of each molecule and letting these surface patches interact with each other to calculate thermodynamic properties. In this study, we aim to enhance the performance of the open-source implementation openCOSMO-RS by incorporating dispersive interactions between the paired segments. Several parametrizations were systematically evaluated through the extensive regression analysis using a comprehensive database of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE), Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium (LLE) and Infinite Dilution Activity Coefficients (IDACs). Furthermore, the influence of different combinatorial terms on the model performance was investigated. Our findings indicate that incorporating dispersive interactions significantly improves the accuracy of phase equilibrium predictions for halocarbons and refrigerant mixtures.</description>

      <title>Global Surface Warming Caused by Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone in the Last Two Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth's surface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of regional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface temperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs), ozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent (SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by a conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6) and 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since 2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide fingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar (non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both surface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016 once the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes, which caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by the positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to improved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated results by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose destruction is consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven reaction mechanism with larger rates at higher latitudes. With observations of rapidly lowered aerosol loading, projected halogenated GHGs and stopped Arctic amplification, we predict to observe an emerging long-term GMST reversal that started at the end of 2023.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Grain Size Distribution on the Defect Generation Mechanism of 0201 Passives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in electronics manufacturing has necessitated the demand for miniaturization of electronic components. In particular, the product sizes for passive components have evolved from 1005 (1.0x0.5mm) which is roughly the size of a grain of sand to 0201 (0.25x0.125mm) which is 1/16th the size of a grain of sand. Grain size distribution and composition play a vital role in tailoring the demands for reliably shrinking dimension of passives. The study focuses on analyzing the effect of grain size and composition, which plays a significant role in maintaining high yield output during the manufacturing processes. The objective of this study is to compare the grain morphology and its effect on defect generation mechanism for 0201 resistors. The experimental setup was prepared to evaluate the grain structure as per ASTM E112-3 test standards. The 0201 resistor samples from three different vendors were assembled on test vehicle PCB (Printed Circuit Board). The resulting observations of the study showed that tombstoning defect was observed during the reflow process for Vendor A. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) results showed the presence of microstructural difference in the tin grain size of resistors. The tin grain size for Vendor A was observed to be 2 microns, whereas the grain size for Vendors B and C were 4 and 5 microns, respectively. Furthermore, the results of grain size measurements performed using the intercept method showed that a grain size number of 13 and 13.6 was observed for Vendors B and C, whereas a grain size number of 15 was observed for Vendor A. The second phase of the study focuses on techniques for improving the grain size number to mitigate the tombstoning defect. It was observed that using an alternate plating solution during the manufacturing of passives resulted in decreased grain size number while containing the tombstoning issue.</description>

      <title>Janus graphene nanoribbons with a single ferromagnetic zigzag edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological design of pi-electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases. Symmetric ZGNRs typically exhibit antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a new class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the 1D limit, but also establishes a long-sought carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics. However, designing such GNRs entails overcoming daunting challenges, including simultaneous breaking of structural and spin symmetries, and designing elegant precursors for asymmetric fabrication of reactive zigzag edges. Here, we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb's theorem and topological classification theory, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introduced a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin symmetry breaking. Three Z-shape precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the defective edge. Characterization via scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of Janus GNRs with ferromagnetic ground state delocalised along the pristine zigzag edge.</description>

      <title>A note on accurate pressure calculations of Coulomb systems with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we address some issues concerning the accurate pressure calculation of Coulomb systems with periodic boundary conditions. First, we prove that the formulas for the excess part of the pressure with Ewald summation also reduce to the ensemble average of one-third of the ratio between the potential energy and the volume so that the comments on our previous work in a recent paper by [Onegin~\emph{et al}.,~J. Phys. A: Math.~Theor.~57 (2024) 205002] are incorrect. Second, we demonstrate that in charge non-neutral systems, the pressure expression must be corrected to include interactions with the neutralizing background. This addresses the issues about pressure computation in LAMMPS raised in the paper by Onegin {\it et al.}. Numerical experiments are performed to verify that the pressure obtained via Ewald summation with corrected terms agrees with the average pressure using thermodynamics for the non-neutral OCP system, and are independent of the splitting parameter in the Ewald summation.</description>

Abstract: We explore the effect of poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) molar mass on the intrinsic permeability and structural characteristics of poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate PEGDA/PEG composite hydrogel membranes. We observe that by varying the PEG content and molar mass, we can finely adjust the water intrinsic permeability over several orders of magnitude. Notably, we show the existence of a maximum water intrinsic permeability, already identified in a previous study to be located at the critical overlap concentration C^* of PEG chains, for the highest PEG molar mass studied. Furthermore, we note that the maximum intrinsic permeability follows a non-monotonic evolution with respect to the PEG molar mass and reaches its peak at 35 000 g.mol-1. Besides our results show that a significant fraction of PEG chains is irreversibly trapped within the PEGDA matrix even for the shortest molar masses down to 600 g.mol-1. This observation suggests the possibility of covalent grafting of PEG chains to the PEGDA matrix. CryoSEM and AFM measurements demonstrate the presence of large micron-sized cavities separated by PEGDA-rich walls whose nanometric structure strongly depends on the PEG content. By combining our permeability and structural measurements, we suggest that the PEG chains trapped inside the PEGDA rich walls induce nanoscale defects in the cross linking density, resulting in an increased permeability below C^*. Conversely, above C^*, we speculate that partially-trapped PEG chains may form a brush-like arrangement on the surface of the PEGDA-rich walls, leading to a reduction in permeability. These two opposing effects are anticipated to exhibit molar-mass-dependent trends, contributing to the non-monotonic variation of the maximum intrinsic permeability at C^*. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential to fine-tune the properties of hydrogel membranes, offering new opportunities in separation applications.</description>

Abstract: The ground state of an homogeneous electron gas is a paradigmatic state that has been used to model and predict the electronic structure of matter at equilibrium for nearly a century. For half a century, it has been successfully used to predict ground states of quantum systems via the local density approximation (LDA) of density functional theory (DFT); and systematic improvements in the form of generalized gradient approximations and evolution thereon. Here, we introduce the LDA for \emph{excited} states by considering a particular class of non-thermal ensemble states of the homogeneous electron gas. These states find sound foundation and application in ensemble-DFT -- a generalization of DFT that can deal with ground and excited states on equal footing. The ensemble-LDA is shown to successfully predict difficult low-lying excitations in atoms and molecules for which approximations based on local spin density approximation (LSDA) and time-dependent-LDA fail.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Macroscopic Behaviour of Molecular Dynamics with Membership Functions</title>

Abstract: Markov processes serve as foundational models in many scientific disciplines, such as molecular dynamics, and their simulation forms a common basis for analysis. While simulations produce useful trajectories, obtaining macroscopic information directly from microstate data presents significant challenges. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the concept of membership functions being the macrostates themselves. We derive equations for the holding times of these macrostates and demonstrate their consistency with the classical definition. Furthermore, we discuss the application of the ISOKANN method for learning these quantities from simulation data. In addition, we present a novel method for extracting transition paths from simulations based on the ISOKANN results and demonstrate its efficacy by applying it to simulations of the {\mu}-opioid receptor. With this approach we provide a new perspective on the analysis of macroscopic behaviour of Markov systems.</description>

      <title>Interpreting effective energy barriers to membrane permeation in terms of a heterogeneous energy landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07830</link>

Abstract: Major efforts in recent years have been directed towards understanding molecular transport in polymeric membranes, in particular reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes. Transition-state theory is an increasingly common approach to explore mechanisms of transmembrane permeation with molecular details, but most applications treat all free energy barriers to transport within the membrane as equal. This assumption neglects the inherent structural and chemical heterogeneity in polymeric membranes. In this work, we expand the transition-state theory framework to include distributions of membrane free energy barriers. We show that the highest free energy barriers along the most permeable paths, rather than typical paths, provide the largest contributions to the experimentally-observed effective free energy barrier. We show that even moderate, random heterogeneity in molecular barriers will significantly impact how we interpret the mechanisms of transport through membranes. Simplified interpretations of experimentally measured barriers can lead to incorrect assumptions about the underlying mechanisms governing transport and miss the mechanisms most relevant to the overall permeability.</description>

      <title>General Framework for Quantifying Dissipation Pathways in Open Quantum Systems. II. Numerical Validation and the Role of Non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00267</link>

Abstract: In the previous paper [C. W. Kim and I. Franco, J. Chem. Phys. 160, 214111 (2024)], we developed a theory called MQME-D, which allows us to decompose the overall energy dissipation process in open quantum system dynamics into contributions by individual components of the bath when the subsystem dynamics is governed by a Markovian quantum master equation (MQME). Here, we contrast the predictions of MQME-D against the numerically exact results obtained by combining hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with a recently reported protocol for monitoring the statistics of the bath. Overall, MQME-D accurately captures the contributions of specific bath components to the overall dissipation while greatly reducing the computational cost as compared to exact computations using HEOM. The computations show that MQME-D exhibits errors originating from its inherent Markov approximation. We demonstrate that its accuracy can be significantly increased by incorporating non-Markovianity by exploiting time scale separations (TSS) in different components of the bath. Our work demonstrates that MQME-D combined with TSS can be reliably used to understanding how energy is dissipated in realistic open quantum system dynamics.</description>
