      <title>Targeted Resilient Zoning for High Impact Events via Multi Circuit Polelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of High Impact and Low Probability events such as hurricanes and windstorms pose significant challenges to the resilience of electrical power distribution systems, particularly in regions of New England where there is a significant amount of overhead infrastructure in areas where vegetation is predominant. Traditional reliability-focused planning is insufficient to address the systemic vulnerabilities exposed by such extreme events. This paper presents a novel risk based framework for long term resilience planning of active overhead distribution systems, with a specific focus on mitigating the impacts of high wind and hurricane induced outages.</description>

      <title>Competitive Equilibrium for Electricity Markets with Spatially Flexible Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium (GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence, uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL systems.</description>

      <title>A Scenario-Based Approach for Stochastic Economic Model Predictive Control with an Expected Shortfall Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to stochastic economic model predictive control (SEMPC) that minimizes average economic cost while satisfying an empirical expected shortfall (EES) constraint to manage risk. A new scenario-based problem formulation ensuring controlled risk with high confidence while minimizing the average cost is introduced. The probabilistic guarantees is dependent on the number of support elements over the entire input domain, which is difficult to find for high-dimensional systems. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to find the number of support elements. Finally, an efficient method is presented to reduce the computational complexity of the SEMPC problem with an EES constraint. The approach is validated on a water distribution network, showing its effectiveness in balancing performance and risk.</description>

      <title>Green Wireless Network Scaling for Joint Deployment: Multi-BSs or Multi-RISs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imminent emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks faces critical challenges from spatially heterogeneous traffic and escalating energy consumption, necessitating sustainable scaling strategies for network infrastructure such as base stations (BSs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This paper establishes fundamental scaling laws for the Integrated Relative Energy Efficiency (IREE) metric under joint multi-BS and multi-RIS deployment in traffic-mismatched scenarios. Specifically, we propose an Alternating Directional Dual-Radial Basis Function (ADD-RBF) framework that models the channels of BSs and RISs as two type of spatially decoupled RBF neurons to maximize IREE through alternative optimization, with proven universal approximation capability and convergence guarantees. Theoretical analysis reveals a scaling dichotomy: BS proliferation drives logarithmic capacity growth $\mathcal{O}(\log N^{BS})$ but only polynomial mismatch reduction $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N^{BS}})$, whereas RIS deployment achieves exponential mismatch mitigation $\mathcal{O}(\delta_{\text{err}}^{-(N^R+1)})$ despite its sub-logarithmic capacity gains. Simulation results validate that RISs excel in capturing spatial traffic correlations and alleviating hotspots, making them particularly effective when mismatch dominates, while BSs are preferable under capacity shortages. These findings offer practical guidelines for green 6G network design.</description>

      <title>From Embedding to Control: Representations for Stochastic Multi-Object Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how to achieve accurate modeling and effective control in stochastic nonlinear dynamics with multiple interacting objects. However, non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We address these challenges by proposing \textit{Graph Controllable Embeddings} (GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture inter-object dependencies and achieve provably low sample complexity. By integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features that are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems, robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution and few-shot tests</description>

      <title>Command-filter-based trajectory-tracking control of quadrotor subject to internal and external disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a command-filter backstepping controller that integrates a disturbance observer and a high-gain observer (HGO) to handle unknown internal and external disturbances acting on a quadrotor. To build the controller, we first define tracking errors between the measured and desired quadrotor outputs, which allow the system to be rewritten in a new set of state variables. Using this transformed model, we apply Lyapunov theory to derive a backstepping control law. To avoid repeated differentiation of states and virtual controls, a first-order command filter is introduced, and a nonlinear disturbance observer is added to provide disturbance estimates. Each state in the controller and observer is replaced with its estimate from the HGO. The resulting control law enables the quadrotor to follow its path despite internal and external disturbances, with each subsystem allowed its own disturbance type for realism. A new state transformation and Lyapunov-based derivation prevent the usual explosion of complexity, while the HGO reconstructs unmeasured states and their rates for output feedback. The nonlinear disturbance observer attenuates constant and nonlinear disturbances as well as band-limited white noise. The method reduces dependence on high-precision sensors and mitigates wind, model error, and rotor noise effects during flight. Unlike previous studies that treat either disturbance rejection or partial sensing, this work combines the command filter, disturbance observer, and HGO to address both challenges simultaneously while avoiding the complexity growth typical of backstepping designs.</description>

      <title>XWAVE: A Novel Software-Defined Everything Approach for the Manufacturing Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manufacturing sector is moving from rigid, hardware-dependent systems toward flexible, software-driven environments. This transformation is shaped by the convergence of several Software-Defined technologies: Software-Defined Automation virtualizes industrial control, replacing proprietary PLCs with containerized, programmable solutions that enable scalability and interoperability. Software-Defined Compute and Communications provide a means to distribute intelligence seamlessly across devices, networks, and cloud platforms, reducing latency and enabling dynamic reconfiguration. Software-Defined Manufacturing Systems, usually implemented as Digital Twins, are real-time virtual models of machines and processes, allowing predictive analysis, optimization, and closer integration between human operators and intelligent systems. This work presents XWAVE, a project that unites these three Software-Defined paradigms to present a modular, fully software-defined manufacturing system.</description>

      <title>Safety Margins of Inverse Optimal ISSf Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gain margin of a general nonlinear system under an inverse optimal input-to-state safe (ISSf) controller of the form u=u0(x)+u*(x,u0), where u0 is the nominal control and u* is the inverse optimal safety filter that minimally modifies the nominal controller's unsafe actions over the infinite horizon. By first establishing a converse ISSf-BF theorem, we reveal the equivalence among the achievability of ISSf by feedback, the achievability of inverse optimality, and the solvability of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation associated with the inverse optimal ISSf gain assignment. Then we develop a collection of safety margin results on the overall control u=u0+u*. In the absence of disturbances, we find that standard inverse optimal safe controllers have a certain degree of gain margin. Specifically, when f(x) acts safely but u0 acts unsafely, the gain can be decreased by up to half; and when f(x) acts unsafely, we establish that, if u0 acts safely, the gain can be increased arbitrarily, whereas if u0 acts unsafely, the control recovers the full gain margin [1/2,inf). It is shown, however, that under control gain variation, the safe set of these controllers is locally asymptotically stable, which implies that their safety is sensitive to large but bounded disturbances. To make inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variation, we propose a gain margin improvement approach at the expense of an increased control effort. This improvement allows the inverse optimal safe control to inherit the standard gain margin of [1/2,inf) without requiring prior knowledge of whether f(x) or u0 acts safely on the safety boundary, while simultaneously ensuring global asymptotic stability of the resulting safe set. In the presence of disturbances, this improvement idea renders inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variations with the same gain margin of [1/2,inf).</description>

      <title>Efficient Collision-Avoidance Constraints for Ellipsoidal Obstacles in Optimal Control: Application to Path-Following MPC and UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a modular optimal control framework for local three-dimensional ellipsoidal obstacle avoidance, exemplarily applied to model predictive path-following control. Static as well as moving obstacles are considered. Central to the approach is a computationally efficient and continuously differentiable condition for detecting collisions with ellipsoidal obstacles. A novel two-stage optimization approach mitigates numerical issues arising from the structure of the resulting optimal control problem. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations and real-world experiments with the Crazyflie quadrotor. This represents the first hardware demonstration of an MPC controller of this kind for UAVs in a three-dimensional task.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Optimization Framework for IAB-Enabled Heterogeneous UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In post-disaster scenarios, the rapid deployment of adequate communication infrastructure is essential to support disaster search, rescue, and recovery operations. To achieve this, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising solution for emergency communication due to its low cost and deployment flexibility. However, conventional untethered UAV (U-UAV) is constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations, making it incapable of maintaining the operation of a macro base station. To address this limitation, we propose a heterogeneous UAV-based framework that integrates tethered UAV (T-UAV) and U-UAVs, where U-UAVs are utilized to enhance the throughput of cell-edge ground user equipments (G-UEs) and guarantee seamless connectivity during G-UEs' mobility to safe zones. It is noted that the integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technique is adopted to support the wireless backhaul of U-UAVs. Accordingly, we formulate a two-timescale joint user scheduling and trajectory control optimization problem, aiming to maximize the downlink throughput under asymmetric traffic demands and G-UEs' mobility. To solve the formulated problem, we proposed a two-timescale multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (TTS-MADDPG) algorithm based on the centralized training and distributed execution paradigm. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmarks, including the two-timescale multi-agent proximal policy optimization (TTS-MAPPO) algorithm and MADDPG scheduling method, with robust and higher throughput. Specifically, the proposed algorithm obtains up to 12.2\% average throughput gain compared to the MADDPG scheduling method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bidding and Coordinated Dispatch of Hybrid Energy Systems in Regulation Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DER) into modern power systems introduces significant uncertainty, posing challenges for maintaining grid flexibility and reliability. Hybrid energy systems (HES), composed of controllable generators, flexible loads, and battery storage, offer a decentralized solution to enhance flexibility compared to single centralized resources. This paper presents a two-level framework to enable HES participation in frequency regulation markets. The upper level performs a chance-constrained optimization to choose capacity bids based on historical regulation signals. At the lower level, a real-time control strategy disaggregates the regulation power among the constituent resources. This real-time control strategy is then benchmarked against an offline optimal dispatch to evaluate flexibility performance. Additionally, the framework evaluates the profitability of overbidding strategies and identifies thresholds beyond which performance degradation may lead to market penalties or disqualification. The proposed framework also compare the impact of imbalance of power capacities on performance and battery state of charge (SoC) through asymmetric HES configurations.</description>

      <title>Graph approach for observability analysis in power system dynamic state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed approach yields a numerical method that provably executes in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and edges in a graph. The graph, constructed from the power system model, requires only knowledge of the dependencies between state-to-state and output-to-state variables within a state-space framework. While graph-based observability analysis methods exist for power system static-state estimation, the approach presented here is the first for dynamic-state estimation (DSE). We examine decentralized and centralized DSE scenarios and compare our findings with a well-established, albeit non-scalable, observability analysis method in the literature. When compared to the latter in a centralized DSE setting, our method reduced computation time by 1440x.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Optimal Sampling and Resource Allocation for Timely Communication in Shared-Spectrum Low-Altitude Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guaranteeing stringent data freshness for low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in shared spectrum forces a critical trade-off between two operational costs: the UAV's own energy consumption and the occupation of terrestrial channel resources. The core challenge is to satisfy the aerial data freshness while finding a Pareto-optimal balance between these costs. Leveraging predictive channel models and predictive UAV trajectories, we formulate a bi-objective Pareto optimization problem over a long-term planning horizon to jointly optimize the sampling timing for aerial traffic and the power and spectrum allocation for fair coexistence. However, the problem's non-convex, mixed-integer nature renders classical methods incapable of fully characterizing the complete Pareto frontier. Notably, we show monotonicity properties of the frontier, building on which we transform the bi-objective problem into several single-objective problems. We then propose a new graph-based algorithm and prove that it can find the complete set of Pareto optima with low complexity, linear in the horizon and near-quadratic in the resource block (RB) budget. Numerical comparisons show that our approach meets the stringent timeliness requirement and achieves a six-fold reduction in RB utilization or a 6 dB energy saving compared to benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Time-Optimal Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems with Multiplicative Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a time-optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems subject to multiplicative uncertainties represented by interval matrices. To render the uncertainty propagation computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two satellites.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Safety Filters with Poisson Safety Functions and Laplace Guidance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation--specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how \textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.</description>

      <title>A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems: Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor. These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of stabilization time.</description>

      <title>A Parallelized Cutting-Plane Algorithm for Computationally Efficient Modelling to Generate Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary macro energy systems modelling is characterized by the need to represent strategic and operational decisions with high temporal and spatial resolution and represent discrete investment and retirement decisions. This drive towards greater fidelity, however, conflicts with a simultaneous push towards greater model representation of inherent complexity in decision making, including methods like Modelling to Generate Alternatives (MGA). MGA aims to map the feasible space of a model within a cost slack by varying investment parameters without changing the operational constraints, a process which frequently requires hundreds of solutions. For large, detailed energy system models this is impossible with traditional methods, leading researchers to reduce complexity with linearized investments and zonal or temporal aggregation. This research presents a new solution method for MGA type problems using cutting-plane methods based on a tailored reformulation of Benders Decomposition. We accelerate the algorithm by sharing cuts between MGA master problems and grouping MGA objectives. We find that our new solution method consistently solves MGA problems times faster and requires less memory than existing monolithic Modelling to Generate Alternatives solution methods on linear problems, enabling rapid computation of a greater number of solutions to highly resolved models. We also show that our novel cutting-plane algorithm enables the solution of very large MGA problems with integer investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Confidential FRIT via Homomorphic Encryption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing alleviates the computation burden of data-driven control in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by offloading complex processing to edge servers. However, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the need for security measures that go beyond conventional IT protections and address the unique vulnerabilities of CPSs. This study proposes a confidential data-driven gain-tuning framework using homomorphic encryption, such as ElGamal and CKKS encryption schemes, to enhance cybersecurity in gain-tuning processes outsourced to external servers. The idea for realizing confidential FRIT is to replace the matrix inversion operation with a vector summation form, allowing homomorphic operations to be applied. Numerical examples under 128-bit security confirm performance comparable to conventional methods while providing guidelines for selecting suitable encryption schemes for secure CPS.</description>

Abstract: This study analyzes the performance of positioning techniques based on configuration changes of 5G New Radio signals. In 5G networks, a terminal position is determined from the Time of Arrival of Positioning Reference Signals transmitted by base stations. We propose an algorithm that improves TOA accuracy under low sampling rate constraints and implement 5G PRS for positioning in a software defined modem. We also examine how flexible time frequency resource allocation of PRS affects TOA estimation accuracy and discuss optimal PRS configurations for a given signal environment.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Task Spaces for Multi-Arm Manipulation Control based on Similarity Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work, represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while giving pointers towards potential future applications.</description>

      <title>Life-cycle Modeling and the Walking Behavior of the Pedestrian-Group as an Emergent Agent: With Empirical Data on the Cohesion of the Group Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the pedestrian group as an emergent agent. The article explores empirical data to derive emergent agency and formation state spaces and outline recurring patterns of walking behavior. In this analysis, pedestrian trajectories extracted from surveillance videos are used along with manually annotated pedestrian group memberships. We conducted manual expert evaluation of observed groups, produced new manual annotations for relevant events pertaining to group behavior and extracted metrics relevant group formation. This information along with quantitative analysis was used to model the life-cycle and formation of the group agent. Those models give structure to expectations around walking behavior of groups; from pedestrian walking independently to the emergence of a collective intention where group members tended to maintain bounded distance between each other. Disturbances to this bounded distance often happened in association with changes in either their agency or their formation states. We summarized the patterns of behavior along with the sequences of state transitions into abstract patterns, which can aid in the development of more detailed group agents in simulation and in the design of engineering systems to interact with such groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People tend to walk in groups, and interactions with those groups have a significant impact on crowd behavior and pedestrian traffic dynamics. Social norms can be seen as unwritten rules regulating people interactions in social settings. This article studies people interactions with groups and the emergence of group proxemics. Group zones, zone occupancy counts and people clearance from the group are studied using naturalistic data. Analysis indicate potential presence of three different zones in addition to the public zone. People tend to remain in the public zone and only progressively get closer to groups, and those closer approaches happen in a low frequency and for brief periods of time.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Home Energy Management System: A Large Language Model Framework for Residential Load Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic, agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension, and future research.</description>

      <title>Statistically Adaptive Differential Protection for AC Microgrids Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds, enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio. These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>

Abstract: The Koopman operator serves as the theoretical backbone for machine learning of dynamical control systems, where the operator is heuristically approximated by extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). In this paper, we propose SafEDMD, a novel stability- and feedback-oriented EDMD-based controller design framework. Our approach leverages a reliable surrogate model generated in a data-driven fashion in order to provide closed-loop guarantees. In particular, we establish a controller design based on semi-definite programming with guaranteed stabilization of the underlying nonlinear system. As central ingredient, we derive proportional error bounds that vanish at the origin and are tailored to control tasks. We illustrate the developed method by means of several benchmark examples and highlight the advantages over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>High Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Cover-Based Distributed Observer Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, This paper presents a coverage solution algorithm for large-scale systems that accounts for both physical and communication network characteristics, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the cover-based distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between cover sets. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proved, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the cover-based distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the cover-based distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show the validity of the developed theories.</description>

      <title>End-to-end guarantees for indirect data-driven control of bilinear systems with finite stochastic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an end-to-end algorithm for indirect data-driven control for bilinear systems with stability guarantees. We consider the case where the collected i.i.d. data is affected by probabilistic noise with possibly unbounded support and leverage tools from statistical learning theory to derive finite sample identification error bounds. To this end, we solve the bilinear identification problem by solving a set of linear and affine identification problems, by a particular choice of a control input during the data collection phase. We provide a priori as well as data-dependent finite sample identification error bounds on the individual matrices as well as ellipsoidal bounds, both of which are structurally suitable for control. Further, we integrate the structure of the derived identification error bounds in a robust controller design to obtain an exponentially stable closed-loop. By means of an extensive numerical study we showcase the interplay between the controller design and the derived identification error bounds. Moreover, we note appealing connections of our results to indirect data-driven control of general nonlinear systems through Koopman operator theory and discuss how our results may be applied in this setup.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Excavation Force Estimation for Wheel Loaders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of excavation forces is critical for enabling autonomous operation and optimizing control strategies in earthmoving machinery. Conventional approaches often depend on extensive data collection or computationally expensive simulations across multiple soil types, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This study presents a data-efficient framework that calibrates soil parameters using force measurements from the preceding bucket-loading cycle. The proposed method is based on an analytical soil-tool interaction model formulated through the fundamental earthmoving equation, and employs a multi-stage optimization procedure during the loading phase to identify relevant soil parameters. These estimated parameters are then used to predict excavation forces in the subsequent cycle, allowing the system to adapt its control inputs without relying on large-scale datasets or machine learning model training. The framework is validated through high-fidelity simulations in the Algoryx Dynamics engine under different soil types and excavation trajectories, achieving root-mean-square prediction errors between 10% and 15%. This cycle-to-cycle adaptation demonstrates strong potential for scalable, online force estimation and efficient path planning in wheel loader operations.</description>

      <title>Convex computation of regions of attraction from data using Sums-of-Squares programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper concentrates on the analysis of the Region of Attraction (RoA) for unknown autonomous dynamical systems. The aim is to explore a data-driven approach based on moment Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy, which enables novel RoA outer approximations despite the reduced information on the structure of the dynamics. The main contribution of this work is bypassing the system model and, consequently, the recurring constraint on its polynomial structure. Numerical experimentation showcases the influence of data on learned approximating sets, offering a promising outlook on the potential of this method.</description>

      <title>Recursive Experiment Design for Closed-Loop Identification with Output Perturbation Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications, system identification experiments must be performed under output feedback to ensure safety or to maintain system operation. In this paper, we consider the online design of informative experiments for ARMAX models by applying a bounded perturbation to the input signal generated by a fixed output feedback controller. Specifically, the design constrains the resulting output perturbation within user-specified limits and can be efficiently computed in closed form. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Merging Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles to Enhance Safety and Energy Efficiency using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized Control Barrier Function (CBF) based approach for highway merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). In this control algorithm, each "host" vehicle negotiates with other agents in a control zone of the highway network, and enacts its own action, to perform safe and energy-efficient merge maneuvers. It uses predictor-corrector loops within the robust CBF setting for negotiation and to reconcile disagreements that may arise. There is no explicit order of vehicles and no priority. A notable feature is absence of gridlocks due to instability of the inter-agent system. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show significant improvement in the system-wide energy efficiency and traffic flow compared to a first-in-first-out approach, as well as enhanced robustness of the proposed decentralized controller compared to its centralized counterpart.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Heuristic Approaches for Platooning Systems with Deadlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient truck platooning is a key strategy for reducing freight costs, lowering fuel consumption, and mitigating emissions. Deadlines are critical in this context, as trucks must depart within specific time windows to meet delivery requirements and avoid penalties. In this paper, we investigate the optimal formation and dispatch of truck platoons at a highway station with finite capacity $L$ and deadline constraints $T$. The system operates in discrete time, with each arriving truck assigned a deadline of $T$ slot units. The objective is to leverage the efficiency gains from forming large platoons while accounting for waiting costs and deadline violations. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and analyze the structure of the optimal policy $\pi^\star$ for $L = 3$, extending insights to arbitrary $L$. We prove certain monotonicity properties of the optimal policy in the state space $\mathcal{S}$ and identify classes of unreachable states. Moreover, since the size of $\mathcal{S}$ grows exponentially with $L$ and $T$, we propose heuristics -- including conditional and deep-learning based approaches -- that exploit these structural insights while maintaining low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Agile and Cooperative Aerial Manipulation of a Cable-Suspended Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadrotors can carry slung loads to hard-to-reach locations at high speed. Since a single quadrotor has limited payload capacities, using a team of quadrotors to collaboratively manipulate a heavy object is a scalable and promising solution. However, existing control algorithms for multi-lifting systems only enable low-speed and low-acceleration operations due to the complex dynamic coupling between quadrotors and the load, limiting their use in time-critical missions such as search and rescue. In this work, we present a solution to significantly enhance the agility of cable-suspended multi-lifting systems. Unlike traditional cascaded solutions, we introduce a trajectory-based framework that solves the whole-body kinodynamic motion planning problem online, accounting for the dynamic coupling effects and constraints between the quadrotors and the load. The planned trajectory is provided to the quadrotors as a reference in a receding-horizon fashion and is tracked by an onboard controller that observes and compensates for the cable tension. Real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve at least eight times greater acceleration than state-of-the-art methods to follow agile trajectories. Our method can even perform complex maneuvers such as flying through narrow passages at high speed. Additionally, it exhibits high robustness against load uncertainties and does not require adding any sensors to the load, demonstrating strong practicality.</description>

      <title>Smart Exploration in Reinforcement Learning using Bounded Uncertainty Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We address this challenge by incorporating prior model knowledge to guide exploration and accelerate the learning process. Specifically, we assume access to a model set that contains the true transition kernel and reward function. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also prove finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under mild assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy, which we call BUMEX (Bounded Uncertainty Model-based Exploration), in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly accelerate learning in benchmark examples. A toolbox is available at https://github.com/JvHulst/BUMEX.</description>

      <title>Cryo-CMOS Antenna for Wireless Communications within a Quantum Computer Cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilization Using Prior Knowledge on Stabilizability and Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study data-driven stabilization of linear time-invariant systems using prior knowledge of system-theoretic properties, specifically stabilizability and controllability. To formalize this, we extend the concept of data informativity by requiring the existence of a controller that stabilizes all systems consistent with the data and the prior knowledge. We show that if the system is controllable, then incorporating this as prior knowledge does not relax the conditions required for data-driven stabilization. Remarkably, however, we show that if the system is stabilizable, then using this as prior knowledge leads to necessary and sufficient conditions that are weaker than those for data-driven stabilization without prior knowledge. In other words, data-driven stabilization is easier if one knows that the underlying system is stabilizable. We also provide new data-driven control design methods in terms of linear matrix inequalities that complement the conditions for informativity.</description>
