      <title>Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated on two systems that serve as well-known models exhibiting chaotic itinerancy: globally coupled logistic maps (GCM) and mutually coupled Gaussian maps. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as the coherent and intermittent phases.</description>

      <title>Self-organized biodiversity and species abundance distribution patterns in ecosystems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the emergence of self-organized biodiversity and species abundance distribution patterns remians a fundamental challenge in ecology. While classical frameworks, such as neutral theory and models based on pairwise species interactions, have provided valuable insights, they often neglect higher-order interactions (HOIs), whose role in stabilizing ecological communities is increasingly recognized. Here, we extend the Generalized Lotka-Volterra framework to incorporate HOIs and demonstrate that these interactions can enhance ecosystem stability and prevent collapse. Our model exhibits a diverse range of emergent dynamics, including self-sustained oscillations, quasi-periodic (torus) trajectories, and intermittent chaos. Remarkably, it also reproduces empirical species abundance distributions observed across diverse natural communities. These results underscore the critical role of HOIs in structuring biodiversity and offer a broadly applicable theoretical framework for capturing complexity in ecological systems</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echo state networks (ESNs) are a class of recurrent neural networks in which only the readout layer is trainable, while the recurrent and input layers are fixed. This architectural constraint enables computationally efficient processing of time-series data. Traditionally, the readout layer in ESNs is trained using supervised learning with target outputs. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), where the readout layer is trained to reconstruct the input time series fed into the ESN. We show that IR can be achieved through unsupervised learning (UL), without access to supervised targets, provided that the ESN parameters are known a priori and satisfy invertibility conditions. This formulation allows applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, to be reformulated within the UL framework via straightforward integration with existing algorithms. Our results suggest that prior knowledge of ESN parameters can reduce reliance on supervision, thereby establishing a new principle: not only by fixing part of the network parameters but also by exploiting their specific values. Furthermore, our UL-based algorithms for input reconstruction and related tasks are suitable for autonomous processing, offering insights into how analogous computational mechanisms might operate in the brain in principle. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of ESNs and their relevance to models in computational neuroscience.</description>
