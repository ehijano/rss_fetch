      <title>Language model driven: a PROTAC generation pipeline with dual constraints of structure and property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imperfect modeling of ternary complexes has limited the application of computer-aided drug discovery tools in PROTAC research and development. In this study, an AI-assisted approach for PROTAC molecule design pipeline named LM-PROTAC was developed, which stands for language model driven Proteolysis Targeting Chimera, by embedding a transformer-based generative model with dual constraints on structure and properties, referred to as the DCT. This study utilized the fragmentation representation of molecules and developed a language model driven pipeline. Firstly, a language model driven affinity model for protein compounds to screen molecular fragments with high affinity for the target protein. Secondly, structural and physicochemical properties of these fragments were constrained during the generation process to meet specific scenario requirements. Finally, a two-round screening of the preliminary generated molecules using a multidimensional property prediction model to generate a batch of PROTAC molecules capable of degrading disease-relevant target proteins for validation in vitro experiments, thus achieving a complete solution for AI-assisted PROTAC drug generation. Taking the tumor key target Wnt3a as an example, the LM-PROTAC pipeline successfully generated PROTAC molecules capable of inhibiting Wnt3a. The results show that DCT can efficiently generate PROTAC that targets and hydrolyses Wnt3a.</description>

      <title>Let Curves Speak: A Continuous Glucose Monitor based Large Sensor Foundation Model for Diabetes Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While previous studies of AI in diabetes management focus on long-term risk, research on near-future glucose prediction remains limited but important as it enables timely diabetes self-management. Integrating AI with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) holds promise for near-future glucose prediction. However, existing models have limitations in capturing patterns of blood glucose fluctuations and demonstrate poor generalizability. A robust approach is needed to leverage massive CGM data for near-future glucose prediction. We propose large sensor models (LSMs) to capture knowledge in CGM data by modeling patients as sequences of glucose. CGM-LSM is pretrained on 15.96 million glucose records from 592 diabetes patients for near-future glucose prediction. We evaluated CGM-LSM against state-of-the-art methods using the OhioT1DM dataset across various metrics, prediction horizons, and unseen patients. Additionally, we assessed its generalizability across factors like diabetes type, age, gender, and hour of day. CGM-LSM achieved exceptional performance, with an rMSE of 29.81 mg/dL for type 1 diabetes patients and 23.49 mg/dL for type 2 diabetes patients in a two-hour prediction horizon. For the OhioT1DM dataset, CGM-LSM achieved a one-hour rMSE of 15.64 mg/dL, halving the previous best of 31.97 mg/dL. Robustness analyses revealed consistent performance not only for unseen patients and future periods, but also across diabetes type, age, and gender. The model demonstrated adaptability to different hours of day, maintaining accuracy across periods of various activity intensity levels. CGM-LSM represents a transformative step in diabetes management by leveraging pretraining to uncover latent glucose generation patterns in sensor data. Our findings also underscore the broader potential of LSMs to drive innovation across domains involving complex sensor data.</description>

      <title>MiCull2 -- simulating mastitis transmission through milking order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contagious mastitis pathogens can be transmitted through milking. However, previously published simulation models, such as MiCull, have not directly taken this into account. We have reimplemented the MiCull model to model transmission of contagious mastitis pathogens through milking in a milking parlor. This additional complexity requires a substantial increase in computations and a need to structure the program code to make it more flexible for future use. The aim of this paper was threefold: First, to implement the new model in a faster programming language; secondly, to describe the new model, in particular transmission of a contagious mastitis pathogen through milking; and thirdly, to compare three different milking order strategies in regards to prevalence and incidence of intramammary infections. For each scenario, 500 herds with 200 cows each were simulated over 10 years. The model was calibrated using available mastitis parameters from the literature. We hypothesized that milking order should have a considerable effect on disease transmission, especially if the infected cows with clinical enter the milking parlor first and thereby have a high risk of infecting the following cows. The milking order scenarios examined were random milking order and milking clinical cases first, or last. Unexpectedly, there were no large differences between these scenarios for reasonably sized infection rates corresponding to a herd with a moderate level of clinical mastitis in the herd. Larger differences are expected to be found in herds with very high infection rates. We have developed a transmission simulation model of mastitis pathogens using a new mode of transmission by milking order. We expect that this new version of MiCull will be useful for both researchers and advisors since it is flexible, can be fitted to various in-herd situations and the computations are fast.</description>

      <title>waveOrder: generalist framework for label-agnostic computational microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlative computational microscopy is accelerating the mapping of dynamic biological systems by integrating morphological and molecular measurements across spatial scales, from organelles to entire organisms. Visualization, measurement, and prediction of interactions among the components of biological systems can be accelerated by generalist computational imaging frameworks that relax the trade-offs imposed by multiplex dynamic imaging. This work reports a generalist framework for wave optical imaging of the architectural order (waveOrder) among biomolecules for encoding and decoding multiple specimen properties from a minimal set of acquired channels, with or without fluorescent labels. waveOrder expresses material properties in terms of elegant physically motivated basis vectors directly interpretable as phase, absorption, birefringence, diattenuation, and fluorophore density; and it expresses image data in terms of directly measurable Stokes parameters. We report a corresponding multi-channel reconstruction algorithm to recover specimen properties in multiple contrast modes. With this framework, we implement multiple 3D computational microscopy methods, including quantitative phase imaging, quantitative label-free imaging with phase and polarization, and fluorescence deconvolution imaging, across scales ranging from organelles to whole zebrafish. These advances are available via an extensible open-source computational imaging library, waveOrder, and a napari plugin, recOrder.</description>

      <title>deepNoC: A deep learning system to assign the number of contributors to a short tandem repeat DNA profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common task in forensic biology is to interpret and evaluate short tandem repeat DNA profiles. The first step in these interpretations is to assign a number of contributors to the profiles, a task that is most often performed manually by a scientist using their knowledge of DNA profile behaviour. Studies using constructed DNA profiles have shown that as DNA profiles become more complex, and the number of DNA-donating individuals increases, the ability for scientists to assign the target number. There have been a number of machine learning algorithms developed that seek to assign the number of contributors to a DNA profile, however due to practical limitations in being able to generate DNA profiles in a laboratory, the algorithms have been based on summaries of the available information. In this work we develop an analysis pipeline that simulates the electrophoretic signal of an STR profile, allowing virtually unlimited, pre-labelled training material to be generated. We show that by simulating 100 000 profiles and training a number of contributors estimation tool using a deep neural network architecture (in an algorithm named deepNoC) that a high level of performance is achieved (89% for 1 to 10 contributors). The trained network can then have fine-tuning training performed with only a few hundred profiles in order to achieve the same accuracy within a specific laboratory. We also build into deepNoC secondary outputs that provide a level of explainability to a user of algorithm, and show how they can be displayed in an intuitive manner.</description>

      <title>RAID-Database: human Responses to Affine Image Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image quality databases are used to train models for predicting subjective human perception. However, most existing databases focus on distortions commonly found in digital media and not in natural conditions. Affine transformations are particularly relevant to study, as they are among the most commonly encountered by human observers in everyday life. This Data Descriptor presents a set of human responses to suprathreshold affine image transforms (rotation, translation, scaling) and Gaussian noise as convenient reference to compare with previously existing image quality databases. The responses were measured using well established psychophysics: the Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling method. The set contains responses to 864 distorted images. The experiments involved 105 observers and more than 20000 comparisons of quadruples of images. The quality of the dataset is ensured because (a) it reproduces the classical Pi\'eron's law, (b) it reproduces classical absolute detection thresholds, and (c) it is consistent with conventional image quality databases but improves them according to Group-MAD experiments.</description>
