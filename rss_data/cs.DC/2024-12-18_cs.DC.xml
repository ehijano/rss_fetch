      <title>Seamless Optical Cloud Computing across Edge-Metro Network for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles, necessitating a revolutionary architecture to support the growing demands for computational power. Cloud computing has become the driving force behind this transformation. However, it consumes significant power and faces computation security risks due to the reliance on extensive data centers and servers in the cloud. Reducing power consumption while enhancing computational scale remains persistent challenges in cloud computing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical cloud computing system that can be seamlessly deployed across edge-metro network. By modulating inputs and models into light, a wide range of edge nodes can directly access the optical computing center via the edge-metro network. The experimental validations show an energy efficiency of 118.6 mW/TOPs (tera operations per second), reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional electronic-based cloud computing solutions. Furthermore, it is experimentally validated that this architecture can perform various complex generative AI models through parallel computing to achieve image generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Priority-Aware Model-Distributed Inference at Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed inference techniques can be broadly classified into data-distributed and model-distributed schemes. In data-distributed inference (DDI), each worker carries the entire Machine Learning (ML) model but processes only a subset of the data. However, feeding the data to workers results in high communication costs, especially when the data is large. An emerging paradigm is model-distributed inference (MDI), where each worker carries only a subset of ML layers. In MDI, a source device that has data processes a few layers of ML model and sends the output to a neighboring device, i.e., offloads the rest of the layers. This process ends when all layers are processed in a distributed manner. In this paper, we investigate the design and development of MDI when multiple data sources co-exist. We consider that each data source has a different importance and, hence, a priority. We formulate and solve a priority-aware model allocation optimization problem. Based on the structure of the optimal solution, we design a practical Priority-Aware Model- Distributed Inference (PA-MDI) algorithm that determines model allocation and distribution over devices by taking into account the priorities of different sources. Experiments were conducted on a real-life testbed of NVIDIA Jetson Xavier and Nano edge devices as well as in the Colosseum testbed with ResNet-50, ResNet- 56, and GPT-2 models. The experimental results show that PA-MDI performs priority-aware model allocation successfully while reducing the inference time as compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>A System for Microserving of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advances in LLMs bring a strong demand for efficient system support to improve overall serving efficiency. As LLM inference scales towards multiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns, such as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving systems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level API with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to customize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we propose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and programming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective microserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A programmable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution patterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV compute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM microserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation orchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows us to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion time compared to the existing strategies.</description>

      <title>TrainMover: Efficient ML Training Live Migration with No Memory Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning training has emerged as one of the most prominent workloads in modern data centers. These training jobs are large-scale, long-lasting, and tightly coupled, and are often disrupted by various events in the cluster such as failures, maintenance, and job scheduling. To handle these events, we rely on cold migration, where we first checkpoint the entire cluster, replace the related machines, and then restart the training. This approach leads to disruptions to the training jobs, resulting in significant downtime. In this paper, we present TrainMover, a live migration system that enables machine replacement during machine learning training. TrainMover minimizes downtime by leveraging member replacement of collective communication groups and sandbox lazy initialization. Our evaluation demonstrates that TrainMover achieves 16x less downtime compared to all baselines, effectively handling data center events like straggler rebalancing, maintenance, and unexpected failures.</description>

      <title>C-FedRAG: A Confidential Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizations seeking to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge querying and analysis often encounter challenges in maintaining an LLM fine-tuned on targeted, up-to-date information that keeps answers relevant and grounded. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible solution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining proprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query responses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data pipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources. In many scenarios, it is necessary to query beyond a single data silo to provide richer and more relevant context for an LLM. Analyzing data sources within and across organizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing policies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast and effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions. In this paper, we introduce Confidential Computing (CC) techniques as a solution for secure Federated Retrieval Augmented Generation (FedRAG). Our proposed Confidential FedRAG system (C-FedRAG) enables secure connection and scaling of a RAG workflows across a decentralized network of data providers by ensuring context confidentiality. We also demonstrate how to implement a C-FedRAG system using the NVIDIA FLARE SDK and assess its performance using the MedRAG toolkit and MIRAGE benchmarking dataset.</description>

      <title>Scam Detection for Ethereum Smart Contracts: Leveraging Graph Representation Learning for Secure Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of scams within Ethereum smart contracts is a critical challenge due to their increasing exploitation for fraudulent activities, leading to significant financial and reputational damages. Existing detection methods often rely on contract code analysis or manually extracted features, which suffer from scalability and adaptability limitations. In this study, we introduce an innovative method that leverages graph representation learning to examine transaction patterns and identify fraudulent contracts. By transforming Ethereum transaction data into graph structures and employing advanced machine learning models, we achieve robust classification performance. Our method addresses label imbalance through SMOTE-ENN techniques and evaluates models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Experimental results indicate that the MLP model surpasses the GCN in this context, with real-world evaluations aligning closely with domain-specific analyses. This study provides a scalable and effective solution for enhancing trust and security in the Ethereum ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Preserving Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing quantum computers can only operate with hundreds of qubits in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) state, while quantum distributed computing (QDC) is regarded as a reliable way to address this limitation, allowing quantum computers to achieve their full computational potential. However, similar to classical distributed computing, QDC also faces the problem of privacy leakage. Existing research has introduced quantum differential privacy (QDP) for privacy protection in central quantum computing, but there is no dedicated privacy protection mechanisms for QDC. To fill this research gap, our paper introduces a novel concept called quantum R\'enyi differential privacy (QRDP), which incorporates the advantages of classical R\'enyi DP and is applicable in the QDC domain. Based on the new quantum R\'enyi divergence, QRDP provides delicate and flexible privacy protection by introducing parameter $\alpha$. In particular, the QRDP composition is well suited for QDC, since it allows for more precise control of the total privacy budget in scenarios requiring multiple quantum operations. We analyze a variety of noise mechanisms that can implement QRDP, and derive the lowest privacy budget provided by these mechanisms. Finally, we investigate the impact of different quantum parameters on QRDP. Through our simulations, we also find that adding noise will make the data less usable, but increase the level of privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Methodology for Fine-Grain GPU Power Visibility and Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ubiquity of AI coupled with its steep power demands make optimizing GPU power a priority as large GPU-based clusters are often employed to train and serve AI models. An important first step in optimizing GPU power consumption is high-fidelity and fine-grain power measurement of key AI computations on GPUs. To this end, we observe that as GPUs get more powerful, the resulting sub-millisecond to millisecond executions make fine-grain power analysis challenging. In this work, we first carefully identify the challenges in obtaining fine-grain GPU power profiles. To address these challenges, we devise FinGraV methodology where we employ execution time binning, careful CPU-GPU time synchronization, and power profile differentiation to collect fine-grain GPU power profiles across prominent AI computations and across spectrum of scenarios. Using FinGraV power profiles, we make several observations pertaining to GPU power variation over executions and over time, GPU sub-component power consumptions across different scenarios, and power behavior over interleaved executions of multiple computations. Equipped with these observations, we conclude with several recommendations to optimize the power for these ubiquitous accelerators.</description>

      <title>Echo: Simulating Distributed Training At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation offers unique values for both enumeration and extrapolation purposes, and is becoming increasingly important for managing the massive machine learning (ML) clusters and large-scale distributed training jobs. In this paper, we build Echo to tackle three key challenges in large-scale training simulation: (1) tracing the runtime training workloads at each device in an ex-situ fashion so we can use a single device to obtain the actual execution graphs of 1K-GPU training, (2) accurately estimating the collective communication without high overheads of discrete-event based network simulation, and (3) accounting for the interference-induced computation slowdown from overlapping communication and computation kernels on the same device. Echo delivers on average 8% error in training step -- roughly 3x lower than state-of-the-art simulators -- for GPT-175B on a 96-GPU H800 cluster with 3D parallelism on Megatron-LM under 2 minutes.</description>

      <title>Round and Communication Efficient Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of communication complexity, we explore randomized protocols for graph coloring, focusing specifically on the vertex and edge coloring problems in $n$-vertex graphs $G$ with a maximum degree $\Delta$. We consider a scenario where the edges of $G$ are partitioned between two players. Our first contribution is a randomized protocol that efficiently finds a $(\Delta + 1)$-vertex coloring of $G$, utilizing $O(n)$ bits of communication in expectation and completing in $O(\log \log n \cdot \log \Delta)$ rounds in the worst case. This advancement represents a significant improvement over the work of Flin and Mittal [PODC 2024], who achieved the same communication cost but required $O(n)$ rounds in expectation, thereby making a significant reduction in the round complexity. We also present a randomized protocol for a $(2\Delta - 1)$-edge coloring of $G$, which maintains the same $O(n)$ bits of communication in expectation over $O(\log^\ast \Delta)$ rounds in the worst case. We complement the result with a tight $\Omega(n)$-bit lower bound on the communication complexity of the $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring, while a similar $\Omega(n)$ lower bound for the $(\Delta+1)$-vertex coloring has been established by Flin and Mittal [PODC 2024].</description>

      <title>Exploring AI-Enabled Cybersecurity Frameworks: Deep-Learning Techniques, GPU Support, and Future Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional rule-based cybersecurity systems have proven highly effective against known malware threats. However, they face challenges in detecting novel threats. To address this issue, emerging cybersecurity systems are incorporating AI techniques, specifically deep-learning algorithms, to enhance their ability to detect incidents, analyze alerts, and respond to events. While these techniques offer a promising approach to combating dynamic security threats, they often require significant computational resources. Therefore, frameworks that incorporate AI-based cybersecurity mechanisms need to support the use of GPUs to ensure optimal performance.
  Many cybersecurity framework vendors do not provide sufficiently detailed information about their implementation, making it difficult to assess the techniques employed and their effectiveness. This study aims to overcome this limitation by providing an overview of the most used cybersecurity frameworks that utilize AI techniques, specifically focusing on frameworks that provide comprehensive information about their implementation. Our primary objective is to identify the deep-learning techniques employed by these frameworks and evaluate their support for GPU acceleration. We have identified a total of \emph{two} deep-learning algorithms that are utilized by \emph{three} out of 38 selected cybersecurity frameworks. Our findings aim to assist in selecting open-source cybersecurity frameworks for future research and assessing any discrepancies between deep-learning techniques used in theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12687v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>

      <title>AsyncSC: An Asynchronous Sidechain for Multi-Domain Data Exchange in Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sidechain techniques improve blockchain scalability and interoperability, providing decentralized exchange and cross-chain collaboration solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) data across various domains. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) schemes for IoT multi-domain data exchange are constrained by the need for synchronous networks, hindering efficient cross-chain interactions in discontinuous networks and leading to suboptimal data exchange. In this paper, we propose AsyncSC, a novel asynchronous sidechain construction. It employs a committee to provide Cross-Blockchain as a Service (C-BaaS) for data exchange in multi-domain IoT. To fulfill the need for asynchronous and efficient data exchange, we combine the ideas of aggregate signatures and verifiable delay functions to devise a novel cryptographic primitive called delayed aggregate signature (DAS), which constructs asynchronous cross-chain proofs (ACPs) that ensure the security of cross-chain interactions. To ensure the consistency of asynchronous transactions, we propose a multilevel buffered transaction pool that guarantees the transaction sequencing. We analyze and prove the security of AsyncSC, simulate an asynchronous communication environment, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation. The results show that AsyncSC outperforms SOTA schemes, improving throughput by an average of 1.21 to 3.96 times, reducing transaction latency by 59.76% to 83.61%, and maintaining comparable resource overhead.</description>

Abstract: The primary promise of decentralized learning is to allow users to engage in the training of machine learning models in a collaborative manner while keeping their data on their premises and without relying on any central entity. However, this paradigm necessitates the exchange of model parameters or gradients between peers. Such exchanges can be exploited to infer sensitive information about training data, which is achieved through privacy attacks (e.g Membership Inference Attacks -- MIA). In order to devise effective defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the factors that increase/reduce the vulnerability of a given decentralized learning architecture to MIA. In this study, we extensively explore the vulnerability to MIA of various decentralized learning architectures by varying the graph structure (e.g number of neighbors), the graph dynamics, and the aggregation strategy, across diverse datasets and data distributions. Our key finding, which to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is heavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each node upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing properties of the communication graph. We illustrate these results experimentally using four datasets and by theoretically analyzing the mixing properties of various decentralized architectures. Our paper draws a set of lessons learned for devising decentralized learning systems that reduce by design the vulnerability to MIA.</description>

      <title>Cuckoo Heavy Keeper and the balancing act of maintaining heavy-hitters in stream processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding heavy hitters in databases and data streams is a fundamental problem, with applications ranging from network monitoring to database query optimization, anomaly detection, and more. Approximation algorithms offer practical solutions, but they present multi-faceted trade-offs involving throughput, memory usage, and accuracy. Moreover, evolving applications demand capabilities beyond sequential processing - they require both parallel performance scaling and support for concurrent queries/updates.
  To address these challenges holistically, we first propose a new algorithm, Cuckoo Heavy Keeper, that combines careful algorithmic design with system-aware perspectives, to effectively balance competing trade-offs. Recognizing the diverse needs of different applications, we then propose two parallel algorithms optimized for different workload patterns: one prioritizes insertion throughput while the other targets efficient heavy hitter queries, both achieving high performance via efficient parallel scaling while supporting concurrent operations. Besides discussing the algorithms' bounds, through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that Cuckoo Heavy Keeper improves throughput by 1.7X to 5.6X and accuracy by 1.9X to 27,542X compared to state-of-the-art methods under tight memory constraints, maintaining these advantages even with low-skew datasets. The parallel variants achieve near-linear scaling up to 70 threads while maintaining heavy hitters query latencies as low as 36 {\mu}sec to 350 {\mu}sec.</description>

      <title>Temporal Parallelisation of the HJB Equation and Continuous-Time Linear Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical formulation to perform temporal parallelisation of continuous-time optimal control problems, which can be solved via the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. We divide the time interval of the control problem into sub-intervals, and define a control problem in each sub-interval, conditioned on the start and end states, leading to conditional value functions for the sub-intervals. By defining an associative operator as the minimisation of the sum of conditional value functions, we obtain the elements and associative operators for a parallel associative scan operation. This allows for solving the optimal control problem on the whole time interval in parallel in logarithmic time complexity in the number of sub-intervals. We derive the HJB-type of backward and forward equations for the conditional value functions and solve them in closed form for linear quadratic problems. We also discuss numerical methods for computing the conditional value functions. The computational advantages of the proposed parallel methods are demonstrated via simulations run on a multi-core central processing unit and a graphics processing unit.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Domain Bias for Federated Learning in Representation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14975</link>

Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) is popular for its privacy-preserving and collaborative learning abilities. However, under statistically heterogeneous scenarios, we observe that biased data domains on clients cause a representation bias phenomenon and further degenerate generic representations during local training, i.e., the representation degeneration phenomenon. To address these issues, we propose a general framework Domain Bias Eliminator (DBE) for FL. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DBE can promote bi-directional knowledge transfer between server and client, as it reduces the domain discrepancy between server and client in representation space. Besides, extensive experiments on four datasets show that DBE can greatly improve existing FL methods in both generalization and personalization abilities. The DBE-equipped FL method can outperform ten state-of-the-art personalized FL methods by a large margin. Our code is public at https://github.com/TsingZ0/DBE.</description>

      <title>Residual-INR: Communication Efficient On-Device Learning Using Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that collects and processes data at or near the source of data generation. The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharc-lab/Residual-INR.</description>

      <title>TRAIL: Trust-Aware Client Scheduling for Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the sensitivity of data, federated learning (FL) is employed to enable distributed machine learning while safeguarding data privacy and accommodating the requirements of various devices. However, in the context of semi-decentralized federated learning (SD-FL), clients' communication and training states are dynamic. This variability arises from local training fluctuations, heterogeneous data distributions, and intermittent client participation. Most existing studies primarily focus on stable client states, neglecting the dynamic challenges present in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a trust-aware client scheduling mechanism (TRAIL) that assesses client states and contributions, enhancing model training efficiency through selective client participation. Our focus is on a semi-decentralized federated learning framework where edge servers and clients train a shared global model using unreliable intra-cluster model aggregation and inter-cluster model consensus. First, we develop an adaptive hidden semi-Markov model (AHSMM) to estimate clients' communication states and contributions. Next, we address a client-server association optimization problem to minimize global training loss. Using convergence analysis, we propose a greedy client scheduling algorithm. Finally, our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an improvement of 8.7\% in test accuracy and a reduction of 15.3\% in training loss.</description>
