      <title>On $k$-planar Graphs without Short Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of forbidding short cycles to the edge density of $k$-planar graphs; a $k$-planar graph is one that can be drawn in the plane with at most $k$ crossings per edge. Specifically, we consider three settings, according to which the forbidden substructures are $3$-cycles, $4$-cycles or both of them (i.e., girth $\ge 5$). For all three settings and all $k\in\{1,2,3\}$, we present lower and upper bounds on the maximum number of edges in any $k$-planar graph on $n$ vertices. Our bounds are of the form $c\,n$, for some explicit constant $c$ that depends on $k$ and on the setting. For general $k \geq 4$ our bounds are of the form $c\sqrt{k}n$, for some explicit constant $c$. These results are obtained by leveraging different techniques, such as the discharging method, the recently introduced density formula for non-planar graphs, and new upper bounds for the crossing number of $2$-- and $3$-planar graphs in combination with corresponding lower bounds based on the Crossing Lemma.</description>

      <title>Degree-balanced decompositions of cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every cubic graph on $n$ vertices contains a spanning subgraph in which the number of vertices of each degree deviates from $\frac{n}{4}$ by at most $\frac{1}{2}$, up to three exceptions. This resolves the conjecture of Alon and Wei (Irregular subgraphs, Combin. Probab. Comput. 32(2) (2023), 269--283) for cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa property for non-null $S$-$T$ paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a group $\Gamma$, a $\Gamma$-labelled graph is an undirected graph $G$ where every orientation of an edge is assigned an element of $\Gamma$ so that opposite orientations of the same edge are assigned inverse elements. A path in $G$ is non-null if the product of the labels along the path is not the neutral element of $\Gamma$. We prove that for every finite group $\Gamma$, non-null $S$-$T$ paths in $\Gamma$-labelled graphs exhibit the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. More precisely, there is a function $f$, depending on $\Gamma$, such that for every $\Gamma$-labelled graph $G$, subsets of vertices $S$ and $T$, and integer $k$, one of the following objects exists: a family $\cal F$ consisting of $k$ non-null $S$-$T$ paths in $G$ such that every vertex of $G$ participates in at most two paths of $\cal F$; or a set $X$ consisting of at most $f(k)$ vertices that meets every non-null $S$-$T$ path in $G$. This in particular proves that in undirected graphs $S$-$T$ paths of odd length have the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property.</description>

      <title>HYGENE: A Diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are powerful mathematical structures that can model complex, high-order relationships in various domains, including social networks, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. However, generating realistic and diverse hypergraphs remains challenging due to their inherent complexity and lack of effective generative models. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation (HYGENE) method that addresses these challenges through a progressive local expansion approach. HYGENE works on the bipartite representation of hypergraphs, starting with a single pair of connected nodes and iteratively expanding it to form the target hypergraph. At each step, nodes and hyperedges are added in a localized manner using a denoising diffusion process, which allows for the construction of the global structure before refining local details. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of HYGENE, proving its ability to closely mimic a variety of properties in hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ deep learning models for hypergraph generation, and our work aims to lay the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Correlated Knapsack Orienteering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the {\em correlated knapsack orienteering} (CSKO) problem: we are given a travel budget $B$, processing-time budget $W$, finite metric space $(V,d)$ with root $\rho\in V$, where each vertex is associated with a job with possibly correlated random size and random reward that become known only when the job completes. Random variables are independent across different vertices. The goal is to compute a $\rho$-rooted path of length at most $B$, in a possibly adaptive fashion, that maximizes the reward collected from jobs that processed by time $W$. To our knowledge, CSKO has not been considered before, though prior work has considered the uncorrelated problem, {\em stochastic knapsack orienteering}, and {\em correlated orienteering}, which features only one budget constraint on the {\em sum} of travel-time and processing-times.
  We show that the {\em adaptivity gap of CSKO is not a constant, and is at least $\Omega\bigl(\max\sqrt{\log{B}},\sqrt{\log\log{W}}\}\bigr)$}. Complementing this, we devise {\em non-adaptive} algorithms that obtain: (a) $O(\log\log W)$-approximation in quasi-polytime; and (b) $O(\log W)$-approximation in polytime. We obtain similar guarantees for CSKO with cancellations, wherein a job can be cancelled before its completion time, foregoing its reward. We also consider the special case of CSKO, wherein job sizes are weighted Bernoulli distributions, and more generally where the distributions are supported on at most two points (2-CSKO). Although weighted Bernoulli distributions suffice to yield an $\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log B})$ adaptivity-gap lower bound for (uncorrelated) {\em stochastic orienteering}, we show that they are easy instances for CSKO. We develop non-adaptive algorithms that achieve $O(1)$-approximation in polytime for weighted Bernoulli distributions, and in $(n+\log B)^{O(\log W)}$-time for the more general case of 2-CSKO.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property of tripods in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a directed graphs with distinguished sets of sources $S\subseteq V(D)$ and sinks $T\subseteq V(D)$. A tripod in $D$ is a subgraph consisting of the union of two $S$-$T$-paths that have distinct start-vertices and the same end-vertex, and are disjoint apart from sharing a suffix.
  We prove that tripods in directed graphs exhibit the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. More precisely, there is a function $f\colon \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that for every digraph $D$ with sources $S$ and sinks $T$, if $D$ does not contain $k$ vertex-disjoint tripods, then there is a set of at most $f(k)$ vertices that meets all the tripods in $D$.</description>

      <title>On extended 1-perfect bitrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended $1$-perfect codes in the Hamming scheme $H(n,q)$ can be equivalently defined as codes that turn to $1$-perfect codes after puncturing in any coordinate, as completely regular codes with certain intersection array, as uniformly packed codes with certain weight coefficients, as diameter perfect codes with respect to a certain anticode, as distance-$4$ codes with certain dual distances. We define extended $1$-perfect bitrades in $H(n,q)$ in five different manners, corresponding to the different definitions of extended $1$-perfect codes, and prove the equivalence of these definitions of extended $1$-perfect bitrades. For $q=2^m$, we prove that such bitrades exist if and only if $n=lq+2$. For any $q$, we prove the nonexistence of extended $1$-perfect bitrades if $n$ is odd.
  Keywords: Perfect code, Extended perfect code, Bitrade, Completely regular code, Uniformly packed code.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree ($k$), even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of $g$-cycles traversing a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of some Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding slightly tighter lower bounds of the diameters than those for random $k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\'{a}s and de la Vega. They range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>
