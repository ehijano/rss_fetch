      <title>A note on the maximum probability of ultra log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jakimiuk et al. (2024) have proved that, if $X$ is an ultra log-concave random variable with integral mean, then $$\max_n \mathbb{P}\{X=n\} \geq \max_n \mathbb{P} \{Z=n\}\,,$$ where $Z$ is a Poisson random variable with the parameter $\mathbb{E}[X]$. In this note, we show that this inequality does not always hold true when $X$ is ultra log-concave with $\mathbb{E}[X]&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional $q$-Jacobi Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Jacobi polynomials on the interval $[-1,1]$ are eigenfunctions of a second order differential operator. It is well known that this operator generates a diffusion process on $[-1,1]$. Further, this fact admits an extension to $N$ dimensions (Demni (2010), Remling-R\"osler (2011)) leading to a $3$-parameter family of diffusion processes $X_N$ on the space of $N$-particle configurations in $[-1,1]$. The generators of the processes $X_N$ are related to Heckman-Opdam's Jacobi polynomials attached to the root system $BC_N$.
  The first result of the paper shows that the processes $X_N$ have a $q$-analog, the $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi processes. These are Feller Markov processes related to the $N$-variate symmetric big $q$-Jacobi polynomials. The later polynomials were introduced and studied by Stokman (1997) and Stokman-Koornwinder (1997); they depend on two Macdonald parameters $(q,t)$ and $4$ extra continuous parameters.
  The $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi processes are still defined on a space of $N$-particle configurations, only now the particles live not on $[-1,1]$ but on certain one-dimensional $q$-grids.
  The second result (the main one) asserts that the $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi processes survive a limit transition as $N$ goes to infinity and two of the extra parameters vary together with $N$ in a certain way. In the limit, one obtains a family of Feller Markov processes which are infinite-dimensional in the sense that they live on configurations with infinitely many particles. The proof uses a lifting of the multivariate big $q$-Jacobi polynomials to the algebra of symmetric functions -- a construction that does not hold for the Heckman-Opdam's Jacobi polynomials.
  Note also that the large-$N$ limit transition is carried out without any space scaling, which would be impossible in the continuous case.</description>

      <title>Weak Error of Dean-Kawasaki Equation with Smooth Mean-Field Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the weak-error rate of the SPDE approximation by regularized Dean-Kawasaki equation with It\^o noise for particle systems with mean-field interactions both on the drift and the noise. The global existence and uniqueness of the corresponding SPDEs are established using the variational approach to SPDEs, and the weak-error rate is estimated using the technique of Kolmogorov equations on the space of probability measures. In particular, the rate derived in this paper coincides with that is the previous work arXiv:2212.11714, which considered free Brownian particles using Laplace duality.</description>

      <title>Moment generating functions and moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Aistleitner, Gantert, Kabluchko, Prochno and Ramanan studied large deviation principles (LDPs) for lacunary trigonometric sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2 \pi n_k x)$, where the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ satisfies the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1} / n_k \geq q &gt; 1$ for $k \geq 1$. A crucial ingredient in their work were asymptotic estimates for the moment generating function (MGF) of such sums, which turned out to depend on the fine arithmetic structure of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ in an intricate way. In the present paper we carry out a detailed study of the MGF for lacunary trigonometric sums (without any structural assumptions on the underlying sequence, other than lacunarity), and we determine the sharp threshold where arithmetic effects start to play a role. As an application, we prove moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums, and show that the tail probabilities are in accordance with Gaussian behavior throughout the whole range between the central limit theorem and the LDP regime.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for functionals of linear processes in critical regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=\{X_n: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ be the linear process defined by $X_n=\sum^{\infty}_{j=1} a_j\varepsilon_{n-j}$, where the coefficients $a_j=j^{-\beta}\ell(j)$ are constants with $\beta&gt;0$ and $\ell$ a slowly varying function, and the innovations $\{\varepsilon_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ are i.i.d. random variables belonging to the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law with $\alpha\in(0,2]$. Limit theorems for the partial sum $ S_{[Nt]}=\sum^{[Nt]}_{n=1}[K(X_n)-\mathbb{E}K(X_n)]$ with proper measurable functions $K$ have been extensively studied, except for two critical regions: I. $\alpha\in(1,2),\beta=1$ and II. $\alpha\beta=2,\beta\geq1$. In this paper, we address these open scenarios and identify the asymptotic distributions of $S_{[Nt]}$ under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Unifying Directed and Undirected Random Graph Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore mathematical tools that can be used to relate directed and undirected random graph models to each other. We identify probability spaces on which a directed and an undirected graph model are equivalent, and investigate which graph events can subsequently be translated between equivalent models. We finally give coupling techniques that can be used to establish an approximate equivalence between directed and undirected random graph models. As an application of these tools, we give conditions under which two broad classes of random graph models are equivalent. In one of these classes the presence of edges/arcs is determined by independent Bernoulli random variables, while in the other class a fixed number of edges/arcs is placed in between vertices according to some probability measure. We finally use these equivalences to extend a previously established relationship between the directed versions of these model classes to their undirected counterparts.</description>

      <title>Sub-elliptic diffusions on compact groups via Dirichlet form perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides an extension of parts of the classical finite dimensional sub-elliptic theory in the context of infinite dimensional compact connected metrizable groups. Given a well understood and well behaved bi-invariant Laplacian, $\Delta$, and a sub-Laplacian, $L$, to which intrinsic distances, $d_\Delta$, $d_L$, are naturally attached, we show that a comparison inequality of the form $d_L\le C(d_\Delta)^c$ (for some $0&lt;c\le 1$) implies that the Dirichlet form of a fractional power of $\Delta$ is dominated by the Dirichlet form associated with $L$. We use this result to show that, under additional assumptions, certain good properties of the heat kernel for $\Delta$ are then passed to the heat kernel associated with $L$. Explicit examples on the infinite product of copies of $SU(2)$ are discussed to illustrate these results.</description>

      <title>Concentration around a stable equilibrium for the non-autonomous $\Phi_3^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-dependent singular stochastic partial differential equations on the three-dimensional torus. These equations are only well-posed after one adds renormalization terms. In order to construct a well-defined notion of solution, one should put the equation in a more general setting, like the one of regularity structures. In this article, we consider the alternative paradigm of paracontrolled distributions, and get concentration results around a stable deterministic equilibrium for solutions of non-autonomous generalizations of the $(\Phi_3^4)$ model.</description>

      <title>Competition in a system of Brownian particles: Encouraging achievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12692v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study analytically and numerically a simple model of inter-agent competition, where underachievement is strongly discouraged. We consider $N\gg 1$ particles performing independent Brownian motions on the line. Two particles are selected at random and at random times, and the particle closest to the origin is reset to it. We show that, in the limit of $N\to \infty$, the dynamics of the coarse-grained particle density field can be described by a nonlocal hydrodynamic theory which was encountered in a study of the spatial extent of epidemics in a critical regime. The hydrodynamic theory predicts relaxation of the system toward a stationary density profile of the "swarm" of particles, which exhibits a power-law decay at large distances. An interesting feature of this relaxation is a non-stationary "halo" around the stationary solution, which continues to expand in a self-similar manner. The expansion is ultimately arrested by finite-$N$ effects at a distance of order $\sqrt{N}$ from the origin, which gives an estimate of the average radius of the swarm. The hydrodynamic theory does not capture the behavior of the particle farthest from the origin -- the current leader. We suggest a simple scenario for typical fluctuations of the leader's distance from the origin and show that the mean distance continues to grow indefinitely as $\sqrt{t}$. Finally, we extend the inter-agent competition from $n=2$ to an arbitrary number $n$ of competing Brownian particles ($n\ll N$). Our analytical predictions are supported by Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Complete Integrability of the Problem of Full Statistics of Nonstationary Mass Transfer in the Simple Inclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19536v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simple Inclusion Process (SIP) interpolates between two well-known lattice gas models: the independent random walkers and the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model. Here we study large deviations of nonstationary mass transfer in the SIP at long times in one dimension. We suppose that $N\gg 1$ particles start from a single lattice site at the origin, and we are interested in the probability $\mathcal{P}(M,N,T)$ of observing $M$ particles, $0\leq M\leq N$, to the right of the origin at a specified time $T\gg 1$. At large times, the corresponding probability distribution has a large-deviation behavior, $-\ln \mathcal{P}(M,N,T) \simeq \sqrt{T} s(M/N,N/\sqrt{T})$. We determine the rate function $s$ exactly by uncovering and utilizing complete integrability, by the inverse scattering method, of the underlying equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. We also analyze different asymptotic limits of the rate function $s$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion in confining potentials: non-equilibrium distribution tails and optimal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08461v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At long times, a fractional Brownian particle in a confining external potential reaches a non-equilibrium (non-Boltzmann) steady state. Here we consider scale-invariant power-law potentials $V(x)\sim |x|^m$, where $m&gt;0$, and employ the optimal fluctuation method (OFM) to determine the large-$|x|$ tails of the steady-state probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(x)$ of the particle position. The calculations involve finding the optimal (that is, the most likely) path of the particle, which determines these tails, via a minimization of the exact action functional for this system, which has recently become available. Exploiting dynamical scale invariance of the model in conjunction with the OFM ansatz, we establish the large-$|x|$ tails of $\ln \mathcal{P}(x)$ up to a dimensionless factor $\alpha(H,m)$, where $0&lt;H&lt;1$ is the Hurst exponent. We determine $\alpha(H,m)$ analytically (i) in the limits of $H\to 0$ and $H\to 1$, and (ii) for $m=2$ and arbitrary $H$, corresponding to the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. Our results for the fOU process are in agreement with the previously known exact $\mathcal{P}(x)$ and autocovariance. The form of the tails of $\mathcal{P}(x)$ yields exact conditions, in terms of $H$ and $m$, for the particle confinement in the potential. For $H\neq 1/2$, the tails encode the non-equilibrium character of the steady state distribution, and we observe violation of time reversibility of the system except for $m=2$. To compute the optimal paths and the factor $\alpha(H,m)$ for arbitrary permissible $H$ and $m$, one needs to solve an (in general nonlinear) integro-differential equation. To this end we develop a specialized numerical iteration algorithm which accounts analytically for an intrinsic cusp singularity of the optimal paths for $H&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Risk-sensitive Planning via Entropic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive planning aims to identify policies maximizing some tail-focused metrics in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Such an optimization task can be very costly for the most widely used and interpretable metrics such as threshold probabilities or (Conditional) Values at Risk. Indeed, previous work showed that only Entropic Risk Measures (EntRM) can be efficiently optimized  through dynamic programming, leaving a hard-to-interpret parameter to choose.     We show that the computation of the full set of optimal policies for EntRM across parameter values leads to tight approximations for the metrics of interest. We prove that this optimality front can be computed effectively thanks to a novel structural analysis and smoothness properties of entropic risks.     Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance in a variety of decision-making scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the value function in the time-optimal problem for a continuity equation in the space of probability measures. We derive the dynamic programming principle for this problem. In particular, we prove that the Kruzhkov transform of the value function coincides with a unique discontinuous viscosity solution to the corresponding Dirichlet problem for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Finally, we establish the $\Gamma$-convergence of the value function in a perturbed problem to the value function in the unperturbed problem.</description>

Abstract: We study a stochastic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (SCGL) on compact surfaces with magnetic Laplacian and polynomial nonlinearity, forced by a space-time white noise. After renormalizing the equation in a suitable manner, we show that the dynamics is locally well-posed. Moreover, we prove deterministic global well-posedness for the defocusing SCGL in the weakly dispersive regime.</description>

      <title>A point process on the unit circle with antipodal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the point process \begin{align*} \frac{1}{Z_{n}}\prod_{1 \leq j &lt; k \leq n} |e^{i\theta_{j}}+e^{i\theta_{k}}|^{\beta}\prod_{j=1}^{n} d\theta_{j}, \qquad \theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{n} \in (-\pi,\pi], \quad \beta &gt; 0, \end{align*} where $Z_{n}$ is the normalization constant. This point process is attractive: it involves $n$ dependent, uniformly distributed random variables on the unit circle that attract each other. (For comparison, the well-studied C$\beta$E involves $n$ uniformly distributed random variables on the unit circle that repel each other.)
  We consider linear statistics of the form $\sum_{j=1}^{n}g(\theta_{j})$ as $n \to \infty$, where $g\in C^{1,q}$ and $2\pi$-periodic. We prove that the leading order fluctuations around the mean are of order $n$ and given by $\smash{\big(g(U)-\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}g(\theta) \frac{d\theta}{2\pi}}\big)n$, where $U \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(-\pi,\pi]$. We also prove that the subleading fluctuations around the mean are of order $\sqrt{n}$ and of the form $\mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{R}}(0,4g'(U)^{2}/\beta)\sqrt{n}$, i.e. that the subleading fluctuations are given by a Gaussian random variable that itself has a random variance.
  Our proof uses techniques developed by McKay and Isaev [8,6] to obtain asymptotics of related $n$-fold integrals.</description>

      <title>The random field Ising chain domain-wall structure in the large interaction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the configurations of the nearest neighbor Ising ferromagnetic chain with IID centered and square integrable external random field in the limit in which the pairwise interaction tends to infinity. The available free energy estimates for this model show a strong form of disorder relevance, i.e., a strong effect of disorder on the free energy behavior, and our aim is to make explicit how the disorder affects the spin configurations. We give a quantitative estimate that shows that the infinite volume spin configurations are close to one explicit disorder dependent configuration when the interaction is large. Our results confirm predictions on this model obtained in D. S. Fisher, P. Le Doussal and C. Monthus (Phys. Rev. E 2001) by applying the renormalization group method introduced by D. S. Fisher (Phys. Rev. B 1995).</description>

      <title>From 1 to infinity: The log-correction for the maximum of variable-speed branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the extremes of variable speed branching Brownian motion (BBM) where the time-dependent "speed functions", which describe the time-inhomogeneous variance, converge to the identity function.
  We consider general speed functions lying strictly below their concave hull and piecewise linear, concave speed functions.
  In the first case, the log-correction for the order of the maximum depends only on the rate of convergence of the speed function near 0 and 1 and exhibits a smooth interpolation between the correction in the i.i.d. case, $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \ln t$, and that of standard BBM, $\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} \ln t$.
  In the second case, we describe the order of the maximum in dependence of the form of speed function and show that any log-correction larger than $\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} \ln t$ can be obtained.
  In both cases, we prove that the limiting law of the maximum and the extremal process essentially coincide with those of standard BBM, using a first and second moment method which relies on the localisation of extremal particles.
  This extends the results of Bovier and Hartung for two-speed BBM.</description>

      <title>Strong asymptotic freeness of Haar unitaries in quasi-exponential dimensional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove almost sure strong asymptotic freeness of i.i.d. random unitaries with the following law: sample a Haar unitary matrix of dimension $n$ and then send this unitary into an irreducible representation of $U(n)$. The strong convergence holds as long as the irreducible representation arises from a pair of partitions of total size at most $n^{\frac{1}{42}-\varepsilon}$ and is uniform in this regime.
  Previously this was known for partitions of total size up to $\asymp\log n/\log\log n$ by a result of Bordenave and Collins.</description>

      <title>Gelation in Vector Multiplicative Coalescence and Extinction in Multi-Type Poisson Branching Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the set of equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process.</description>

      <title>On the shape of the connected components of the complement of two-dimensional Brownian random interlacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limiting shape of the connected components of the vacant set of two-dimensional Brownian random interlacements: we prove that the connected component around $x$ is close in distribution to a rescaled \emph{Brownian amoeba} in the regime when the distance from $x\in\mathbb{C}$ to the closest trajectory is small (which, in particular, includes the cases $x\to\infty$ with fixed intensity parameter $\alpha$, and $\alpha\to\infty$ with fixed $x$). We also obtain a new family of martingales built on the conditioned Brownian motion, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics: the memory-dependent probability density evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the non-Markovian dynamics. The governing equations are derived for the probability density functions (PDFs) of non-Markovian stochastic responses to Langevin equation excited by combined fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) and Gaussian white noise (GWN). The main difficulty here is that the Langevin equation excited by FGN cannot be augmented by a filter excited by GWN, leading to the inapplicability of It\^o stochastic calculus theory. Thus, in the present work, based on the fractional Wick It\^o Skorohod integral and rough path theory, a new non-Markovian probability density evolution method is established to derive theoretically the memory-dependent probability density evolution equation (PDEEs) for the PDFs of non-Markovian stochastic responses to Langevin equation excited by combined FGN and GWN, which is a breakthrough to stochastic dynamics. Then, we extend an efficient algorithm, the local discontinuous Galerkin method, to numerically solve the memory-dependent PDEEs. Remarkably, this proposed method attains a higher accuracy compared to the prevalent methods such as finite difference, path integral (PI) and Monte Carlo methods, and boasts a broader applicability than the PI method, which fails to solve the memory-dependent PDEEs. Finally, several numerical examples are illustrated to verify the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>On absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein space over R and their representation by an optimal Markov process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ = ($\mu$t)t$\in$R be a 1-parameter family of probability measures on R. In [11] we introduced its ``Markov-quantile''process: a process X= (Xt)t$\in$R that resembles as much as possible the quantile process attached to $\mu$, among the Markov processesattached to $\mu$, i.e. whose family of marginal laws is $\mu$.In this article we look at the case where $\mu$ is absolutely continuous in the Wasserstein space P2(R). Then X is solution of adynamical transport problem with marginals ($\mu$t)t. It provides a Markov minimal Lagrangian probabilistic representative of $\mu$, whichis moreover unique among the processes obtained as certain types of limits: limits for the finite dimensional topology of quantileprocesses where the past is made independent of the future conditionally on the present at finitely many times, or limits of processeslinearly interpolating $\mu$.This raises new questions about ways to obtain Markov Lagrangian representatives, and to seek uniqueness properties in thisframework.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of McKean-Vlasov SDEs via stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to numerically approximate McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDE) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) while avoiding the use of interacting particle systems. The SGD technique is deployed to solve a Euclidean minimization problem, obtained by first representing the MV-SDE as a minimization problem over the set of continuous functions of time, and then approximating the domain with a finite-dimensional subspace. Convergence is established by proving certain intermediate stability and moment estimates of the relevant stochastic processes, including the tangent processes. Numerical experiments illustrate the competitive performance of our SGD based method compared to the IPS benchmarks. This work offers a theoretical foundation for using the SGD method in the context of numerical approximation of MV-SDEs, and provides analytical tools to study its stability and convergence.</description>

      <title>Tensorial free convolution, semicircular, free Poisson and R-transform in high order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work builds on our previous developments regarding a notion of freeness for tensors. We aim to establish a tensorial free convolution for compactly supported measures. First, we define higher-order analogues of the semicircular (or Wigner) law and the free Poisson (or Marcenko-Pastur) law, giving their moments and free cumulants. We prove the convergence of a Wishart-type tensor to the free Poisson law and recall the convergence of a Wigner tensor to the semicircular law. We also present a free Central Limit Theorem in this context. Next, we introduce a tensorial free convolution, define the $R$-transform, and provide the first examples of free convolution of measures.</description>
