      <title>Review of Passenger Flow Modelling Approaches Based on a Bibliometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the field of short-term passenger flow forecasting within local public transit, covering 814 publications that span from 1984 to 2024. In addition to common bibliometric analysis tools, a variant of a citation network was developed, and topic modelling was conducted. The analysis reveals that research activity exhibited sporadic patterns prior to 2008, followed by a marked acceleration, characterised by a shift from conventional statistical and machine learning methodologies (e.g., ARIMA, SVM, and basic neural networks) to specialised deep learning architectures. Based on this insight, a connection to more general fields such as machine learning and time series modelling was established. In addition to modelling, spatial, linguistic, and modal biases were identified and findings from existing secondary literature were validated and quantified. This revealed existing gaps, such as constrained data fusion, open (multivariate) data, and underappreciated challenges related to model interpretability, cost-efficiency, and a balance between algorithmic performance and practical deployment considerations. In connection with the superordinate fields, the growth in relevance of foundation models is also noteworthy.</description>

      <title>US Code growth 1991-2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first scientific article since 2010 counting the words which are effective and permanent federal law in the United States (US) Code. The latest version of the US Code --published in 2025-- is the largest since 1991, encompassing over 24.4 million words. The low since 1991 was 1993 at roughly 15 million words. The word count grew in 30 out of 33 years. The average characters per word --potentially indicative of complexity-- grew even in all 33 years. The research also touches upon why it is undesirable for laws to be longer and longer and mentions possible remedies.</description>

      <title>The current state of open access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents reflections from the perspective of a university librarian involved in the establishment and management of institutional repositories in Japan. It examines the historical evolution of scholarly communication, from the oral exchanges of ancient Greek philosophers, through the advent of printing and the rise of academic journals, to the contemporary digital era. The origins of the open access movement are emphasized as rooted in authors' desire to disseminate knowledge globally, rather than merely opening access for readers. The article critically discusses current practices in Japan, including institutional repositories, open access journals, and "read-and-publish" agreements, highlighting that many digital innovations still imitate the conventions of print-based scholarly communication. Furthermore, it explores the challenges and opportunities posed by electronic information dissemination, including the limitations of the Version of Record and the potential of diamond open access models. The article argues that genuine progress in scholarly communication requires rethinking publication practices, embracing the modifiability of digital content, and developing new communication models fully suited to the internet era. Ultimately, the goal is to realize a global, real-time, trustworthy scholarly communication system that transcends the historical constraints of print media.</description>

      <title>PRITES: An integrative framework for investigating and assessing web-scraped HTTP-response datasets for research applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to programmatically retrieve vast quantities of data from online sources has given rise to increasing usage of web-scraped datasets for various purposes across government, industry and academia. Contemporaneously, there has also been growing discussion about the statistical qualities and limitations of collecting from online data sources and analysing web-scraped datasets. However, literature on web-scraping is distributed across computer science, statistical methodology and application domains, with distinct and occasionally conflicting definitions of web-scraping and conceptualisations of web-scraped data quality. This work synthesises technical and statistical concepts, best practices and insights across these relevant disciplines to inform documentation during web-scraping processes, and quality assessment of the resultant web-scraped datasets.
  We propose an integrated framework to cover multiple processes during the creation of web-scraped datasets including 'Plan', 'Retrieve', 'Investigate', 'Transform', 'Evaluate' and 'Summarise' (PRITES). The framework groups related quality factors which should be monitored during the collection of new web-scraped data, and/or investigated when assessing potential applications of existing web-scraped datasets. We connect each stage to existing discussions of technical and statistical challenges in collecting and analysing web-scraped data. We then apply the framework to describe related work by the co-authors to adapt web-scraped retail prices for alcoholic beverages collected by an industry data partner into analysis-ready datasets for public health policy research. The case study illustrates how the framework supports accurate and comprehensive scientific reporting of studies using web-scraped datasets.</description>

      <title>Rdgai: Classifying transcriptional changes using Large Language Models with a test case from an Arabic Gospel tradition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application of phylogenetic methods to textual traditions has traditionally treated all changes as equivalent even though it is widely recognized that certain types of variants were more likely to be introduced than others. While it is possible to give weights to certain changes using a maximum parsimony evaluation criterion, it is difficult to state a priori what these weights should be. Probabilistic methods, such as Bayesian phylogenetics, allow users to create categories of changes, and the transition rates for each category can be estimated as part of the analysis. This classification of types of changes in readings also allows for inspecting the probability of these categories across each branch in the resulting trees. However, classification of readings is time-consuming, as it requires categorizing each reading against every other reading at each variation unit, presenting a significant barrier to entry for this kind of analysis. This paper presents Rdgai, a software package that automates this classification task using multi-lingual large language models (LLMs). The tool allows users to easily manually classify changes in readings and then it uses these annotations in the prompt for an LLM to automatically classify the remaining reading transitions. These classifications are stored in TEI XML and ready for downstream phylogenetic analysis. This paper demonstrates the application with data an Arabic translation of the Gospels.</description>

      <title>SciRAG: Adaptive, Citation-Aware, and Outline-Guided Retrieval and Synthesis for Scientific Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating growth of scientific publications has intensified the need for scalable, trustworthy systems to synthesize knowledge across diverse literature. While recent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have improved access to scientific information, they often overlook citation graph structure, adapt poorly to complex queries, and yield fragmented, hard-to-verify syntheses. We introduce SciRAG, an open-source framework for scientific literature exploration that addresses these gaps through three key innovations: (1) adaptive retrieval that flexibly alternates between sequential and parallel evidence gathering; (2) citation-aware symbolic reasoning that leverages citation graphs to organize and filter supporting documents; and (3) outline-guided synthesis that plans, critiques, and refines answers to ensure coherence and transparent attribution. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks such as QASA and ScholarQA demonstrate that SciRAG outperforms prior systems in factual accuracy and synthesis quality, establishing a new foundation for reliable, large-scale scientific knowledge aggregation.</description>

      <title>The Drain of Scientific Publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The domination of scientific publishing in the Global North by major commercial publishers is harmful to science. We need the most powerful members of the research community, funders, governments and Universities, to lead the drive to re-communalise publishing to serve science not the market.</description>

      <title>NAIST Academic Travelogue Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have constructed NAIST Academic Travelogue Dataset (ATD) and released it free of charge for academic research. This dataset is a Japanese text dataset with a total of over 31 million words, comprising 4,672 Japanese domestic travelogues and 9,607 overseas travelogues. Before providing our dataset, there was a scarcity of widely available travelogue data for research purposes, and each researcher had to prepare their own data. This hinders the replication of existing studies and fair comparative analysis of experimental results. Our dataset enables any researchers to conduct investigation on the same data and to ensure transparency and reproducibility in research. In this paper, we describe the academic significance, characteristics, and prospects of our dataset.</description>
