      <title>Proof of Light-Induced Electron Pairing in a Bilayer Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous experimental and theoretical work has given evidence of the existence of doubly charged exciton states in strongly screened bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layers. These complexes are important because they are performed electron pairs that can, in principle, undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), in which case they would also form a new type of superconductor, consisting of stable bosons with net charges. In this paper, we present key electrostatic and magnetic measurements that definitively confirm the existence of these charged bosons. These measurements include 1) continuous control of the doping density with both positive and negative carriers, showing the expected population dependencies on the free carrier density, and 2) measurement of the dependence on the magnetic field, showing that this new bound state is a spin triplet. These results imply that it is promising to look for BEC and superconductivity in this system.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconductivity Mediated by Nematic Fluctuations in a Multi-Orbital System -- Application to doped FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze superconductivity in a multi-orbital fermionic system near the onset of a nematic order, using doped FeSe as an example. We associate nematicity with a spontaneous polarization between $d_{\text{xz}}$ and $d_{\text{yz}}$ orbitals (a Pomeranchuk-type order) and analyze the pairing mediated by soft nematic fluctuations. Such a pairing gives rise to a highly anisotropic gap function whose structure strongly varies with temperature, and leads to strongly non-BCS behavior in thermodynamics, spectroscopy and transport. We compute the specific heat and its directional variation with a magnetic field, magnetic susceptibility, density of states, tunneling conductance, Raman intensity, superfluid stiffness and penetration depth without and with impurity scattering and for the latter computed also optical conductivity and $T_c$ variation. We find good agreement with the existing data for FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ and FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ and suggest new experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the ladder-like Josephson junction array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper theoretical analysis of the ladder-like multirow array of inductively coupled Josephson junctions is presented. An external dc current is applied at the top to each of the columns of the array and is extracted at the bottom of that column. The density of states of the Josephson plasma waves has a $\delta$-function term due to the flat band and $3N-2$ singularities where $N$ is the number of rows. The spatial distribution of the amplitudes of the plasmon wave is computed analytically for any given value of the wavenumber $q$. It is expressed through the orthogonal polynomials that are similar but not identical to the Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>Chiral finite-momentum superconductivity in the tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in tetralayer graphene, we investigate the pairing mechanism arising from density-density interactions within the random phase approximation. This approach successfully highlights the dominance of chiral $p$-wave pairing between electrons with the same spin and valley at low electron densities, while also predicting the superconducting range in agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, we examine the characteristics of distinct superconducting regions: SC1 and SC2 exhibit chiral finite-momentum superconductivity with pronounced phase fluctuations, whereas SC4 displays nematic zero-momentum superconductivity, with its transition temperature constrained by the pairing strength. Additionally, we delve into the exotic features of chiral finite-momentum superconductivity, underscoring its potential significance for realizing a charge-4e exotic metal with time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Electron microscopy and spectroscopy investigation of atomic, electronic, and phonon structures of NdNiO2/SrTiO3 interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infinite-layer nickelates, proposed as analogs to superconducting cuprates, provide a promising platform for exploring the mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity. However, the superconductivity under atmospheric pressure has only been observed in thin films, indicating the heterointerface is essential. Here, we employed the advanced Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy-Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) technique to thoroughly investigate the atomic configuration, layer-resolved electronic states and phonon across the NdNiO2/SrTiO3 interface. We found the Sr atoms diffusion at the interface, which results in hole doping into oxygen and nickel band to form a p-type interface. A pronounced redshift of the highest-energy optical phonon (HEOP) of NdNiO2 (~78 meV) is observed at the interface, which is primarily attributed to the epitaxial strain. Our work clarifies that the effects of the interface on electron and phonon states are mainly due to elemental intermixing and epitaxial strain, which could lay the foundation for future investigations into superconducting mechanisms of infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Response of a Cold-Electron Bolometer in a coplanar antenna system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold electron bolometers have shown their suitability for use in modern fundamental physical experiments. Fabrication and measurements of the samples with cold-electron bolometers integrated into coplanar antennas are performed in this study. The bolometric layer was made using combined aluminum-hafnium technology to improve quality of aluminum oxide layer and decrease the leakage current. The samples of two types were measured in a dilution cryostat at various temperatures from 20 to 300 mK. The first sample with Ti/Au/Pd antenna shows response in the two frequency bands, at 7--9 GHz with bandwidth of about 20%, and also at 14 GHz with 10% bandwidth. The NEP below 10 aW/Hz^1/2 is reached at 300 mK for 7.7 GHz signal. The second sample with aluminum made antenna shows response in the frequency range 0.5--3 GHz due to the effect of kinetic inductance of superconducting aluminum.</description>

      <title>Bending-strain effects in conventional superconductors and superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effect of bending-strain in thin films of clean, conventional superconductors (S), and the proximity-induced effect of this strain in SN bilayers with a normal metal (N), and SNS junctions with equal curvatures in each superconductor. We find that the effective spin-orbit coupling due to strain in the superconductor induces both spin-polarized and unequal-spin even-frequency p-wave triplet pairings throughout the superconductor. When interfaced with a normal metal, additional odd-frequency pairings are induced, and their magnitudes can be tuned with the strain. In SNS junctions, the strain alone can induce a superconducting spin current in the junction. The spin-polarized current can undergo a $0-\pi$-transition, resulting in an in-plane, strain-induced magnetization that switches sign as a function of the strain. We discuss the underlying physics and its implications for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Absence of ferromagnetic instability and weak spin-orbit coupling effect in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, Rb, and K)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of V-based kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, Rb, K) presents an intriguing platform for exploring the interplay of time-reversal symmetry breaking, nontrivial topological bands, and electron correlations, resulting in a range of exotic quantum states, including the anomalous Hall effect, unconventional charge density waves, and superconductivity. These features prompt critical questions regarding the roles of magnetism and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in these systems. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate a notable sensitivity of the magnetic properties to the choice of $k$-point mesh used in Brillouin zone integrations. Specifically, we find that using a dense $k$-point mesh yields a nonmagnetic pristine phase characterized by paramagnetic susceptibility, consistent with the recently observed Pauli paramagnetic behavior in single crystalline samples at high temperatures. In contrast, a coarser $k$-point mesh significantly increases the density of states at the Fermi level, inducing a ferromagnetic instability that satisfies the Stoner criterion. Moreover, our results show that the effect of SOC on both the geometric and electronic structures is minimal, with only a slight gap opening at the Dirac points, indicating a weak SOC influence in these materials. Importantly, our DFT band structure calculations closely align with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data, reinforcing the notion of weak electron correlations in these kagome metals. This refined understanding challenges recent theoretical assertions that the interplay of magnetism, SOC, and electron correlations is essential for determining the nature of charge density waves in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Linear spectroscopy of collective modes and the gap structure in two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optical response in multi-band, multi-layer two-dimensional superconductors. Within a simple model, we show that linear response to AC gating can detect collective modes of the condensate, such as Leggett and clapping modes. We show how trigonal warping of the superconducting order parameter can help facilitate detection of clapping modes. Taking rhombohedral trilayer graphene as an example, we consider several possible pairing mechanisms and show that all-electronic mechanisms may produce in-gap clapping modes. These modes, if present, should be detectable in the absorption of microwaves applied via the gate electrodes, which are necessary to enable superconductivity in this and many other settings; their detection would constitute strong evidence for unconventional pairing. Last, we show that absorption at frequencies above the superconducting gap $2 |\Delta|$ also contains a wealth of information about the gap structure. Our results suggest that linear spectroscopy can be a powerful tool for the characterization of unconventional two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Thermal Grooving Effects on Vortex Penetration in Vapor-Diffused Nb3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Nb3Sn theoretically offers better superconducting RF cavity performance (Q0 and Eacc) to Nb at any given temperature, peak RF magnetic fields consistently fall short of the 400 mT prediction. The relatively rough topography of vapor-diffused Nb3Sn is widely conjectured to be one of the factors that limit the attainable performance of Nb3Sn-coated Nb cavities prepared via Sn vapor diffusion. Here we investigate the effect of coating duration on the topography of vapor-diffused Nb3Sn on Nb and calculate the associated magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors using atomic force microscopy topographies. It is shown that the thermally grooved grain boundaries are major defects which may contribute to a substantial decrease in the achievable accelerating field. The severity of these grooves increases with total coating duration due to the deepening of thermal grooves during the coating process.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations in the Spin-triplet Superconductor Candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ ($T_{\rm c}=0.3$ K) exhibits an exceptionally high critical field of 14 T for $\textbf{B} \parallel \textbf{c}$. It undergoes a field-driven first-order phase transition between superconducting (SC) states, potentially transitioning from spin-singlet to spin-triplet superconductivity. To elucidate the underlying pairing mechanism, we probe spin fluctuations in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ using neutron scattering. We find dynamic $(\pi,\pi)$ antiferromagnetic spin correlations with an anisotropic quasi-two-dimensional correlation volume. Our data place an upper limit of 0.31 $\mu_{\rm B}$ on the staggered magnetization of corresponding N\'{e}el orders at $T=0.08$ K. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, treating Ce $4f$ electrons as core states, show that the AFM wave vector connects significant areas of the Fermi surface. Our findings show the dominant excitations in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ for $\hbar\omega&lt; 1.2$~meV are magnetic and indicate superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is mediated by AFM spin fluctuations associated with a proximate quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Vortex structure in a $d$-wave superconductor obtained by a confinement transition from the pseudogap metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the structure of flux $h/(2e)$ vortices in a d-wave superconductor which emerges from a higher temperature pseudogap metal. Such a transition is described by a continuum theory of the Higgs condensation of 2 flavors of charge $e$ bosons which are fundamentals of an emergent SU(2) gauge field. Period-2 charge order is present near the vortex center. Upon coupling the electrons to the superconducting and charge order parameters, we find that the electronic local density of states does not have a zero-bias peak, in contrast to BCS theory. But there are sub-gap peaks at positive and negative bias, and these exhibit anti-phase periodic spatial modulations, similar to observations in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments in the underdoped cuprates (K. Matsuba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 063704 (2007)).</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity beyond paring in Fermi-liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions for flat dispersion $\varepsilon \sim k^4$, without using pairing instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. These topological chiral superconductors can be fully or partially spin-valley polarized. For partial spin-valley polarization, the ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation, neutral quasiparticles with fractional statistics, and/or gapless chiral edge states. Two of the topological chiral superconductors are in the same phases as the ``spin''-triplet or spinless $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>
