      <title>Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be respected even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators and the anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. We then generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstate can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Thus, eta-pairing may represent a new mechanism for skin effects in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in higher dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry. To realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena, we construct a general two-sublattice model defined on an arbitrary lattice, which can exhibit anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates; besides, this model can reveal the eta-pairing structure [e.g., the $SO(4)$ symmetry] in systems with Hermitian hoppings.</description>

      <title>Giant coercivity and enhanced intrinsic anomalous Hall effect at vanishing magnetization in a compensated kagome ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets that can be driven to magnetic compensation show promise for use in spintronics as they exhibit a finite anomalous Hall effect at zero magnetic field without having a significant magnetic moment. Compensated ferrimagnet spintronic devices with both a large anomalous Hall effect and a high coercivity would be simultaneously easy to read and difficult to erase. The kagome ferrimagnet TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ has been reported to host a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Here, we demonstrate that doping the Mn sites with Cr drives the system towards magnetic compensation. For nearly compensated compositions at low temperatures, giant coercive fields exceeding 14 T are observed. Additionally, Cr doping significantly enhances the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, which can be attributed to a shift in the Fermi level. Our results extend the range of unique magnetic states observed in kagome materials, demonstrating that chemical doping is an effective strategy to tune and realize these states.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Bethe-Salpeter equation in DFT based computational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that accurately describes resonances beyond the reach of both multiplet-based and density-functional-theory (DFT)-based codes. When a resonance acquires strong continuum character, multiplet approaches struggle with the exponential growth of the Hilbert space driven by the increasing number of relevant orbitals, if they extend beyond a few atomic and ligand orbitals. Conversely, existing \emph{ab initio} codes, supplemented by diagrammatic techniques, remain largely confined to the Bethe--Salpeter equation, which tracks only two-particle excitations. However, many systems of interest, particularly those containing open $d$ or $f$ shells, require the propagation of an $N$-particle system, yielding a richer spectral landscape dominated by significant continuum effects. Here, we propose a theoretical framework, together with its numerical implementation, that bridges this gap and enables the rigorous exploration of such resonances.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Kondo Physics with Incommensurate Charge Density Waves in CeTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeTe$_3$ is a 2-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals (VdW) material with incommensurate charge density waves (CDW), extremely high transition temperature ($T_{CDW}$) and a large momentum-dependent CDW gap that leaves a significant portion of the Fermi surface intact. It is also considered to be a weak Kondo system, a property unexpected for a material with incommensurate CDW, where each atomic site is slightly different. Here, we study the properties of the CDW state in several RTe$_3$ (R is rare earth) materials and examine the hybridization of itinerant states with the localized Ce $4f$ multiplet in CeTe$_3$ by using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that the renormalization of the itinerant states originating from the hybridization with the localized $4f$ states at $-260$ meV extends to the Fermi level. This, with remnants of another localized state at the Fermi level, supports the characterization of CeTe$_3$ as a weak Kondo material. Furthermore, we uncover a $k$-dependence of the hybridization with the states $-260$ meV, indicating that similar effect could be the reason for discrepancy between the heavy masses in specific heat and light ones in Shubnikov de Haas oscillations observed in other heavy fermion materials.</description>

      <title>Crossover from Wannier-Stark localization to charge density waves for interacting spinless fermions in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spinless fermions on a finite chain with nearest-neighbor repulsion and in the presence of a Wannier-Stark linearly-varying electric field potential. In the absence of the interaction, the eigenstates are localized for the system's sizes larger than the localization length. We present several analytical expressions for the localization length, which is proportional to the inverse of the electric field. Using the density matrix renormalization group numerical technique, we observe that the ground state exhibits a decrease of the occupation on the chain sites from the `bulk', with occupation 1, to the vacuum, with occupation 0. The width of this intermediate `edge' region is also inversely proportional to the electric field, increasing linearly with the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion. For strong interactions, the occupations in the intermediate region exhibit a charge density wave. We also present the local density of states for sites in the `edge' region. For the non-interacting case, the spectrum shows an increasing energy-localized structure as the field is increased, which is a consequence of the uniform energy distribution of the localized states (Wannier-Stark ladder). This structure survives for small interactions, and it smears out in the strongly interacting limit. Experimental variations of the slope of the potential (the electric field) on cold atom chains may test these predictions.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics and magnetic excitations of quasi-1D spin chain Ca$_3$ZnMnO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reveal the structure-property relationship in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) spin-chain system Ca$_3$ZnMnO$_6$, we present comprehensive results, combining basic physical characterizations such as muon spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical calculations. Ca$_3$ZnMnO$_6$ features a dominant intrachain coupling $J_1$ and two distinct interchain interactions $J_2$ and $J_3$, and it undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=25$~K, as revealed by dc magnetic susceptibility and specific-heat measurements. Zero-field $\mu$SR shows persistent spin dynamics below $T_{\mathrm{N}}$, suggesting unconventional magnetic excitations in the ordered state. NPD results indicate a commensurate magnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{k}=0$, where the Mn spins lie in the $ab$-plane. INS spectra display dispersive magnetic excitations extending up to about 5~meV, with an energy gap smaller than 0.5~meV. Notably, these spectra exhibit three-dimensional (3D) gapped features rather than the expected 1D behavior, yet spin-wave dispersion analysis confirms an underlying quasi-1D energy hierarchy. We discuss this apparent paradox of 3D-like magnetic excitations in a quasi-1D system in terms of the energy hierarchy modified by nonmagnetic-ion substitution and finite-temperature first-principles calculations. We also suggest that Ca$_3$ZnMnO$_6$ could be a potential candidate for an M-type altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall domains in a Quenched Topological Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an interacting spinless quadratic band touching model that realizes a topological Mott insulating state. We quench the interaction from a value corresponding to the nematic insulator to that of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) ordered phase. We perform time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulations and show that after the quench the system realizes an excited Dirac semimetal state, which is however unstable and spontaneously evolves to a state with inhomogeneous nematic and QAH order parameters. The modulations form a stripe pattern that grows exponentially with time until the local Chern marker reaches unity. The alternating QAH order defines a domain structure with boundaries that host chiral sublattice currents.</description>

      <title>Stability of dipolar bosons in a quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials and dipolar interactions each impose long-range order in quantum systems, but their interplay unlocks a rich landscape of unexplored quantum phases. In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic crystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic potentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables - including order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body coherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic lattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a complex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and crystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions, kinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that influence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the presence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous claims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full crystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits appear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a direct transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of many-body quantum phases in complex environments and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum states in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral Instabilities in Driven-Dissipative Quantum Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodically driven Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) coupled to a thermal bath using a Floquet-Lindblad approach. When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fermionic quantum field theories using functional renormalisation. In the limit of many fermion flavours $N$, we demonstrate that theories have exact solutions for their quantum effective actions given by quasi-local interaction functionals of fermion bilinears. The structure implies that local potential approximations are exact, exactly solvable, and that field anomalous dimensions vanish. Theories with non-trivial anomalous dimensions may also arise under conditions that are identified. We further demonstrate that higher derivative interactions are inevitably induced by point-like ones, including at large-$N$. The local potential flows for fermionic theories with the most general $U(N)$ symmetric interactions are provided. For sample theories with scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, or axial-vector interactions, we identify conformal fixed points, scaling dimensions, conformal manifolds, and quantum-induced shifts in scaling dimensions of higher derivative interactions. We also study fermion mass generation, and subleading modifications due to finite $N$ corrections. Implications for conformal field theories, and applications in condensed matter and particle physics are indicated.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven Ultrafast Dynamics of a Fractional Quantum Hall System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</description>

      <title>Probing the flat-band limit of the superconducting proximity effect in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While extensively studied in normal metals, semimetals and semiconductors, the superconducting (SC) proximity effect remains elusive in the emerging field of flat-band systems. In this study we probe proximity-induced superconductivity in Josephson junctions (JJs) formed between superconducting NbTiN electrodes and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) weak links. Here the TBG acts as a highly tunable topological flat-band system, which due to its twist-angle dependent bandwidth, allows to probe the SC proximity effect at the crossover from the dispersive to the flat-band limit. Contrary to our original expectations, we find that the SC remains strong even in the flat-band limit, and gives rise to broad, dome shaped SC regions, in the filling dependent phase diagram. In addition, we find that unlike in conventional JJs, the critical current Ic strongly deviates from a scaling with the normal state conductance GN. We attribute these findings to the onset of strong electron interactions, which can give rise to an excess critical current, and also work out the potential importance of quantum geometric terms as well as multiband pairing mechanisms. Our results present the first detailed study of the SC proximity effect in the flat-band limit and shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the formation of SC domes in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In particular, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a Pfaffian of a matrix based on qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that links the amplitudes of systems with different qubit counts, enabling scalable calculations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for applications in global entanglement, Shannon-R\'enyi entropy, formation probabilities, and quantum tomography, significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Proper analysis of electron collisions in two spatial dimensions leads to the conclusion, that the odd harmonics of the electron distribution function decay much slower than the even ones at finite temperatures. The number of long-lived odd harmonics quickly shrinks with increasing temperature. Focusing on a channel geometry with boundary scattering, we show that such behavior of the odd decay rates leads to a characteristic behaviour of the conductance that we dub anomalous Knudsen effect: it initially grows with temperature but then starts to decrease, forming a peak. Further increase of the temperature forces the conductance to grow again due to the Gurzhi effect, associated with the crossover from ballistic to hydrodynamic transport. The simultaneous observation of the Gurzhi dip preceded by the anomalous Knudsen peak constitutes a particular signature of the long-lived modes in 2D electron transport at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Sign-reversal and non-monotonicity of chirality-related anomalous Hall effect in highly conductive metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-monotonic temperature dependence and sign reversal of chirality-related anomalous Hall effect in highly conductive metals are studied. Through the analysis of scattering rate, we find that the non-monotonicity and sign reversal have two major origins: (1) competition between the contribution from short-range and long-range spin correlations and (2) non-monotonic spin correlation in the high field. The former mechanism gives rise to non-monotonic temperature dependence in a wide range of electron density and, in some cases, a sign reversal of Hall resistivity as the temperature decreases. On the other hand, the latter mechanism is responsible for the sign reversal of Hall conductivity in the high field, which sign reversal generally occurs in magnets with antiferromagnetic interactions. The results demonstrate how the Hall effect reflects local spin correlation and provide insights into the mechanism of non-monotonicity and sign reversal of the anomalous Hall effect by spin chirality.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced spin selectivity based on orbital Edelstein effect in an analytically solvable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity, a phenomenon wherein chiral structures selectively determine the spin polarization of electron currents flowing through the material, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in areas such as spintronics, enantioseparation, and catalysis. The underlying physical effect is the Edelstein effect that converts charge to angular momentum but the precise mechanism remains yet to be understood. Here, we introduce the minimal model for explaining the phenomenon based on the orbital Edelstein effect. We consider inter-site contributions to the current-induced orbital angular momentum and reveal the underlying mechanism by analytically calculating the Edelstein susceptibilities in a tight-binding and Boltzmann approach. While the orbital angular momentum is directly generated by the chirality of the crystal, the spin contribution of each spin-split band pair relies on spin-orbit coupling. Using tellurium as an example, we show that the orbital contribution surpasses the spin contribution by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>

      <title>Programming optical-lattice Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a native implementation of Fermi-Hubbard (FH) models that can be used as analog quantum simulators of many-body fermionic systems. Recent experimental advances include the time-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus enable to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator. Here, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation algorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement both single-particle and many-body, high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided by the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational, pre-compiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively implemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic protocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables to target extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized on the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor tunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of $d$-wave superconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the imaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an alternative state-preparation strategy, and as a subroutine for the Quantum Lanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our protocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to 2D experimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current classical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing programmable fermionic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Dynamical Heterogeneity in a Supercooled Magnetic Monopole Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical heterogeneity, in which transitory local fluctuations occur in the conformation and dynamics of constituent particles, is widely hypothesized to be essential to evolution of supercooled liquids into the glass state. Yet its microscopic spatiotemporal phenomenology has remained unobservable in virtually all molecular glass forming liquids. Because recent theoretical advances predict that corresponding dynamical heterogeneity could occur in supercooled magnetic monopole fluids, we searched for such phenomena in Dy2Ti2O7. By measuring its microsecond-resolved spontaneous magnetization fluctuations $M(t,T)$ we discovered a sharp bifurcation in monopole noise characteristics below $T \approx 1500$ mK, with the appearance of powerful spontaneous monopole current bursts. This intense dynamics emerges upon entering the supercooled monopole fluid regime, reaches maximum strength near $T \approx 500$ mK and then terminates along with coincident loss of ergodicity near $T \lesssim 250$ mK. Moreover, the four-point dynamical susceptibility $\chi_4(T, t)$ is observed directly and evolves as predicted when dynamical heterogeneity is present, clearly revealing its diverging length scales $\xi(T)$. This overall phenomenology greatly expands our empirical knowledge of supercooled monopole fluids and, more generally, demonstrates direct detection of the time sequence, magnitude, statistics and correlations of dynamical heterogeneity, access to which may greatly accelerate fundamental vitrification studies.</description>

Abstract: We find that the double-threshold voltage-current characteristics in the insulating regime in the ultra-clean two-valley two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are promoted by perpendicular magnetic fields, persisting to an order of magnitude lower voltages and considerably higher electron densities compared to the zero-field case. This observation indicates the perpendicular-magnetic-field stabilization of the quantum electron solid.</description>

      <title>Cu NMR study of lightly doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a single crystal Cu NMR study of the cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with hole doping levels between $x=2$\% and $8$\%. Measurements with short spin echo times enable us to systematically study the local properties of the electronic spin system in the region of the phase diagram where the material evolves from the insulating antiferromagnetic parent phase to the superconducting state. We find evidence for qualitative changes as the Sr concentration increases through $x=5$\% in both NMR spectra and relaxation times, which we interpret as signatures of a low-temperature transition from a state with disconnected metallic islands to a granular metal with tunneling between the grains. These results provide microscopic insight into the physics of a doped charge-transfer insulator in the presence of quenched substitutional disorder, indicate that a connectivity transition occurs, and demonstrate that complex nanoscale electronic phase separation is ubiquitous in LSCO around the doping level where superconductivity first appears in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>
