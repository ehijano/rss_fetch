      <title>Computable $K$-theory for $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras: UHF algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the effective content of $K$-theory for $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We prove that there are computable functors which associate, to a computably enumerable presentation of a $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra $\boldA$, computably enumerable presentations of the abelian groups $K_0(\boldA)$ and $K_1(\boldA)$. When $\boldA$ is stably finite, we show that the positive cone of $K_0(\boldA)$ is computably enumerable. We strengthen the results in the case that $\boldA$ is a UHF algebra by showing that the aforementioned presentation of $K_0(\boldA)$ is actually computable. In the UHF case, we also show that $\boldA$ has a computable presentation precisely when $K_0(\boldA)$ has a computable presentation, which in turn is equivalent to the supernatural number of $\boldA$ being lower semicomputable; we give an example that shows that this latter equivalence cannot be improved to requiring that the supernatural number of $\boldA$ is computable. Finally, we prove that every UHF algebra is computably categorical.</description>

      <title>Reals in the Matet and Willow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we try to complete the regularity implications between the regularitites of the well-known tree forcing notions at the $\boldsymbol{\Delta}^1_2$ level of the projective hierarchy. The missing links in this case were the regularities corresponding to Matet and Willow tree Forcings. Some of the techniques yield more general results related to locally countable closed graphs too, which we mention as corollaries.</description>

      <title>Separation of congruence intervals and implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.07237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) has been intensively studied in many areas of computer science and mathematics. The approach to the CSP based on tools from universal algebra turned out to be the most successful one to study the complexity and algorithms for this problem. Several techniques have been developed over two decades. One of them is through associating edge-colored graphs with algebras and studying how the properties of algebras are related with the structure of the associated graphs. This approach has been introduced in our previous two papers (A.Bulatov, Local structure of idempotent algebras I,II. arXiv:2006.09599, arXiv:2006.10239, 2020). In this paper we further advance it by introducing new structural properties of finite idempotent algebras omitting type 1 such as separation congruences, collapsing polynomials, and their implications for the structure of subdirect products of finite algebras. This paper also provides the algebraic background for our proof of Feder-Vardi Dichotomy Conjecture (A. Bulatov, A Dichotomy Theorem for Nonuniform CSPs. FOCS 2017: 319-330).</description>

      <title>Computable classifications of continuous, transducer, and regular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.09499v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic algorithmic framework that unites global and local classification problems using index sets. We prove that the classification problem for continuous (binary) regular functions among almost everywhere linear, pointwise linear-time Lipschitz functions is $\Sigma^0_2$-complete. (Every regular function is pointwise linear-time Lipschitz.) We show that a function $f\colon [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is (binary) transducer if and only if it is continuous regular. As one of many consequences, our $\Sigma^0_2$-completeness result covers the class of transducer functions as well. Finally, we show that the Banach space $C[0,1]$ of real-valued continuous functions admits an arithmetical classification among separable Banach spaces. Our proofs combine methods of abstract computability theory, automata theory, and functional analysis.</description>

      <title>Borel fractional perfect matchings in quasi-transitive amenable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if a locally finite Borel graph with quasitransitive amenable components admits a fractional perfect matching, it will admit a Borel fractional perfect matching. In particular, if a countable amenable quasitransitive graph admits a fractional perfect matching then its Bernoulli graph admits a Borel fractional perfect matching.</description>

      <title>Local structure of idempotent algebras I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09599v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine and advance the study of the local structure of idempotent finite algebras started in [A.Bulatov, The Graph of a Relational Structure and Constraint Satisfaction Problems, LICS, 2004]. We introduce a graph-like structure on an arbitrary finite idempotent algebra including those admitting type 1. We show that this graph is connected, its edges can be classified into 4 types corresponding to the local behavior (set, semilattice, majority, or affine) of certain term operations. We also show that if the variety generated by the algebra omits type 1, then the structure of the algebra can be `improved' without introducing type 1 by choosing an appropriate reduct of the original algebra. Taylor minimal idempotent algebras introduced recently is a special case of such reducts. Then we refine this structure demonstrating that the edges of the graph of an algebra omitting type 1 can be made `thin', that is, there are term operations that behave very similar to semilattice, majority, or affine operations on 2-element subsets of the algebra. Finally, we prove certain connectivity properties of the refined structures.
  This research is motivated by the study of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem, although the problem itself does not really show up in this paper.</description>

      <title>A Fra\"iss\'e theory for partial orders of a fixed finite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each $n\geq 2$, we show that the class of all finite $n$-dimensional partial orders, when expanded with $n$ linear orders which realize the partial order, forms a Fra\"iss\'e class and identify its Fra\"iss\'e limit $(D_n,&lt;,&lt;_1,\ldots,&lt;_n)$. We give a finite axiomatization of this limit which specifies it uniquely up to isomorphism among countable structures. We then show that the aforementioned class of finite structures satisfies the Ramsey property and conclude, by the Kechris-Pestov-Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} correspondence, that the automorphism group of its Fra\"iss\'e limit is extremely amenable. Finally, we identify the universal minimal flow of the automorphism group of the reduct $(D_n,&lt;)$.</description>
