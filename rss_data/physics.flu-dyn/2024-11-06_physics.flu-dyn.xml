      <title>An Efficient Hierarchical Preconditioner-Learner Architecture for Reconstructing Multi-scale Basis Functions of High-dimensional Subsurface Fluid Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling subsurface fluid flow in porous media is crucial for applications such as oil and gas exploration. However, the inherent heterogeneity and multi-scale characteristics of these systems pose significant challenges in accurately reconstructing fluid flow behaviors. To address this issue, we proposed Fourier Preconditioner-based Hierarchical Multiscale Net (FP-HMsNet), an efficient hierarchical preconditioner-learner architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) with multi-scale neural networks to reconstruct multi-scale basis functions of high-dimensional subsurface fluid flow. Using a dataset comprising 102,757 training samples, 34,252 validation samples, and 34,254 test samples, we ensured the reliability and generalization capability of the model. Experimental results showed that FP-HMsNet achieved an MSE of 0.0036, an MAE of 0.0375, and an R2 of 0.9716 on the testing set, significantly outperforming existing models and demonstrating exceptional accuracy and generalization ability. Additionally, robustness tests revealed that the model maintained stability under various levels of noise interference. Ablation studies confirmed the critical contribution of the preconditioner and multi-scale pathways to the model's performance. Compared to current models, FP-HMsNet not only achieved lower errors and higher accuracy but also demonstrated faster convergence and improved computational efficiency, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. This model offers a novel method for efficient and accurate subsurface fluid flow modeling, with promising potential for more complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Revisit Liu and Katz (2006) and Zigunov and Charonko (2024b), Part (I): on the Equivalence of the Omnidirectional Integration and the Pressure Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the equivalency of the Rotating Parallel Ray Omnidirectional Integration (RPR-ODI) and the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE) for pressure field reconstruction from corrupted image velocimetry data. Building on the work by Zigunov and Charonko (2024b), we show that performing the ODI is equivalent to pursuing the minimum norm least square solution to a Poisson equation with all Neumann boundary conditions, which is an ill-posed problem. Looking through the lenses of the well-posedness of the Poisson equation, linear algebra, as well as regression and optimization, we provide a comprehensive and integrated framework to analyze ODI/PPE-based pressure field reconstruction methods. The new comprehensions on the equivalence of ODI and PPE not only can reduce the immense computational cost of ODI to that of PPE, but more importantly, unveil their shared strengths and limitations. This paves the way for further improvements in ODI/PPE-based pressure field reconstruction by utilizing the extensive literature on fast, robust elliptic solvers and their associated regularization methods. Throughout this work, we include remarks and notes offering theoretical and computational insights valuable to experimentalists. Some of these notes illustrate a ``minimalist" regularization strategy, serving as ``minimal reproducible examples" that provide a foundation for further refinement. Numerical experiments are presented to support and illustrate these arguments.</description>

      <title>Dominant balance-based adaptive mesh refinement for incompressible fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method that utilizes dominant balance analysis (DBA) for efficient and accurate grid adaptation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The proposed method leverages a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to classify grid cells into active and passive regions based on the dominant physical interactions in the equation space. Unlike traditional AMR strategies, this approach does not rely on heuristic-based sensors or user-defined parameters, providing a fully automated and problem-independent framework for AMR. Applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for unsteady flow past a cylinder, the DBA-based AMR method achieves comparable accuracy to high-resolution grids while reducing computational costs by up to 70%. The validation highlights the method's effectiveness in capturing complex flow features while minimizing grid cells, directing computational resources toward regions with the most critical dynamics. This modular and scalable strategy is adaptable to a range of applications, presenting a promising tool for efficient high-fidelity simulations in CFD and other multiphysics domains.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic limits of the attached eddy model derived from an adiabatic atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attached-eddy model (AEM) predicts mean velocity and streamwise velocity variance profiles that follow a logarithmic shape in the overlap region of high Reynolds number wall-bounded turbulent flows. Moreover, the AEM coefficients are presumed to attain asymptotically constant values at very high Reynolds numbers. Here, the logarithmic behaviour of the AEM predictions in the near-neutral atmospheric surface layer is examined using sonic anemometer measurements from a 62-m meteorological tower located in the Eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho, US. Utilizing an extensive 210-day dataset, the inertial sublayer (ISL) is first identified by analyzing the measured momentum flux and mean velocity profile. The logarithmic behaviour of the streamwise velocity variance and the associated `-1' scaling of the streamwise velocity energy spectra are then investigated. The findings indicate that the Townsend-Perry coefficient ($A_1$) is influenced by mild non-stationarity that manifests itself as a Reynolds number dependence. After excluding non-stationary runs and requiring a Reynolds number higher than $4 \times 10^7$, the inferred $A_1$ converges to values ranging between 1 and 1.25, consistent with laboratory experiments. Moreover, the independence of the normalized vertical velocity variance from the wall-normal distance in the ISL is further checked and the constant coefficient value agrees with reported laboratory experiments at very high Reynolds numbers as well as many surface layer experiments. Furthermore, nine benchmark cases selected through a restrictive quality control reveal a closer relationship between the `-1' scaling in the streamwise velocity energy spectrum and the logarithmic behaviour of streamwise velocity variance at higher Reynolds numbers, though no direct equivalence between them is observed.</description>

      <title>Suppressing parasitic flow in membraneless diffusion-based microfluidic gradient generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based microfluidic gradient generators (DMGGs) are essential for various in-vitro studies due to their ability to provide a convection-free concentration gradient. However, these systems, often referred to as membrane-based DMGGs, exhibit delayed gradient formation due to the incorporated flow-resistant membrane. This limitation substantially hinders their application in dynamic and time-sensitive studies. Here, we accelerate the gradient response in DMGGs by removing the membrane and implementing new geometrical configurations to compensate for the membrane's role in suppressing parasitic flows. We introduce these novel configurations into two microfluidic designs: the H-junction and the Y-junction. In the H-junction design, parasitic flow is redirected through a bypass channel following the gradient region. The Y-junction design features a shared discharge channel that allows converging discharge flow streams, preventing the buildup of parasitic pressure downstream of the gradient region. Using hydraulic circuit analysis and fluid dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the H-junction and Y-junction designs in suppressing parasitic pressure flows. These computational results, supported by experimental data from particle image velocimetry, confirm the capability of our designs to generate a highly stable, accurate, and convection-free gradient with rapid formation. These advantages make the H-junction and Y-junction designs ideal experimental platforms for a wide range of in-vitro studies, including drug testing, cell chemotaxis, and stem cell differentiation.</description>

      <title>A numerical study on temperature destratification induced by bubble plumes in idealized reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An in-house numerical model has been developed to study the temperature destratification induced by bubble plumes in reservoirs. The mean flow of the mixed fluid phase is solved using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations, while the bubble phase is calculated by employing the advection-diffusion equation of air concentration. The change of water temperature is tracked by solving the energy equation. The two-equation turbulence model, considering the effect of bubble buoyancy and the change of temperature, is adopted to model the turbulent dissipation in two-phase fluid. To validate the accuracy of the numerical model, the numerical results are compared with available experimental data. In addition, the destratification of temperature-layered water in a tank by bubble plumes is simulated by the numerical model, which is also validated by experimental data and the numerical results of another model. This three-dimensional model can reflect various physical quantities in the entire computed filed, such as thermal structure, gas concentration distribution, velocity distribution and turbulence intensity. Furthermore, by utilizing the validated model, a series of factors on reservoir destratification, including the aeration rate and the aeration location are analyzed and discussed in this study. A non-dimensional number Nt is introduced to determine the optimal aeration rate of the fasted destratification. The extent to which bubble plumes can affect the destratification is also simulated and discussed. Meanwhile, the mechanism of destratification in a large water area is described in detail. Suggestions on how to apply bubble plumes to improve the water quality of a reservoir are given.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of buoyancy-aided mixed convective flow past a square cylinder inclined at 45 degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study numerically investigates two-dimensional mixed convective flow of air past a square cylinder placed at an angle of incidence of $\alpha = 45^{\circ}$ to the free-stream. We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) for a Reynolds number (Re) of 100 and a range of Richardson numbers (Ri) between 0.0 and 1.0 and a Prandtl number (Pr) of 0.7. The critical Richardson number at which the near-field becomes a steady flow from an unsteady one, using Stuart-Landau analysis, is found to be Ri $=0.68$, and simultaneously, the far-field unsteadiness emerges. There is no range of Ri for which the entire flow field is seen to be steady. At a relatively moderate Ri, the flow field reveals the presence of vorticity inversion through the momentum deficit/addition in the downstream region. We discuss the dual wake-plume nature of the flow beyond the cylinder. The wake exhibits characteristics similar to those of a buoyant jet in the far-field at increased buoyancy. We explore the cause of the far-field unsteadiness, and discuss the mechanism of the observed flow physics using instantaneous and time-averaged flow fields. The important flow quantities, such as force coefficients, vortex shedding frequency, and Nusselt number, are discussed at various Richardson numbers.</description>

      <title>A data-driven study on Implicit LES using a spectral difference method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a data-driven filter to analyze the relationship between Implicit Large-Eddy Simulations (ILES) and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) in the context of the Spectral Difference method. The proposed filter is constructed from a linear combination of sharp-modal filters where the weights are given by a convolutional neural network trained to replicate ILES results from filtered DNS data. In order to preserve the compactness of the discretization, the filter is local in time and acts at the elementary cell level. The neural network is trained on the data generated from the Taylor-Green Vortex test-case at Re=1600. In order to mitigate the temporal effects and highlight the influence of the spatial discretization, the ILES are periodically restarted from DNS data for different time windows. Smaller time windows result in higher cross-correlations between ILES and the filtered DNS snapshots using the data-driven filters. The modal decay of the filter for the smallest time window considered aligns with classical eigenanalysis, showing better energy conservation for higher orders of approximation. Similarly, an analysis of the filter's kernel in the Fourier space confirms that higher polynomial orders are less dissipative compared to lower orders. As large time windows are considered, the trained filter encounters difficulties in representing the data due to significant non linear effects. Additionally, the impact of the data-driven filter on the resolved kinetic energy has been assessed through the evaluation of the sub-grid production term which results in both direct and inverse cascades with the former being more likely on average. The presence of backscatter suggests that ILES based on Discontinuous Spectral Element Methods might be equipped with an intrinsic mechanisms to transfer energy in both directions with a predominance of direct kinetic energy cascade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using \textit{hydrodynamic entropy} we quantify the multiscale disorder in Euler and hydrodynamic turbulence. These examples illustrate that the hydrodynamic entropy is not extensive because it is not proportional to the system size. Consequently, we cannot add hydrodynamic and thermodynamic entropies, which measure disorder at macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. In this paper, we also discuss the hydrodynamic entropy for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Simulating incompressible flows over complex geometries using the shifted boundary method with incomplete adaptive octree meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the shifted boundary method (SBM) to the simulation of incompressible fluid flow using immersed octree meshes. Previous work on SBM for fluid flow primarily utilized two- or three-dimensional unstructured tetrahedral grids. Recently, octree grids have become an essential component of immersed CFD solvers, and this work addresses this gap and the associated computational challenges. We leverage an optimal (approximate) surrogate boundary constructed efficiently on incomplete and adaptive octree meshes. The resulting framework enables the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in complex geometries without requiring boundary-fitted grids. Simulations of benchmark tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate that the Octree-SBM framework is a robust, accurate, and efficient approach to simulating fluid dynamics problems with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Coalescence induced late departure of bubbles improves water electrolysis efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In water electrolysis, bubbles form on the electrode and interact through processes such as collision and coalescence. However, the impact of bubble coalescence a fundamental process governing electrolytic bubble behaviour-on electrolysis efficiency remains unclear. Here, we show that enhancing bubble coalescence improves electrolysis efficiency by more than 30% compared to systems where coalescence is inhibited. One key feature is the continuous coalescence of a newly detached bubble with microbubbles on the electrode, which delays the former from departing. Experimental observations and numerical simulations reveal two key benefits of bubble coalescence for electrolysis efficiency: (1) it liberates surface bubbles from the electrode at much smaller sizes, reducing their diameter from approximately 60-80 um to less than 10 um, thus freeing the active sites of the electrode from bubble coverage; (2) it induces strong agitation, with velocities reaching 1m/s in a small region near the electrode (at a depth of 10-5 m), thereby significantly improving the heat/mass transfer locally. Importantly, the chaotic agitation effect lasts for approximately 10 ms, two orders of magnitude longer than the coalescence process, which occurs in around 0.2 ms. This work provides valuable insight into bubble management in water electrolysis and other gas-evolution electrochemical reactions.</description>
