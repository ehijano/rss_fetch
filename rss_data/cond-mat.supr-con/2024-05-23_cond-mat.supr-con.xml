      <title>Why Scanning Tunneling Microscopy on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ sometimes doesn't see the superconducting gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is perhaps the most promising way to detect the superconducting gap size and structure in the canonical unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ directly. However, in many cases, researchers have reported being unable to detect the gap at all in simple STM conductance measurements. Recently, an investigation of this issue on various local topographic structures on a Sr-terminated surface found that superconducting spectra appeared only in the region of small nanoscale canyons, corresponding to the removal of one RuO surface layer. Here, we analyze the electronic structure of various possible surface structures using first principles methods, and argue that bulk conditions favorable for superconductivity can be achieved when removal of the RuO layer suppresses the RuO$_4$ octahedral rotation locally. We further propose alternative terminations to the most frequently reported Sr termination where superconductivity surfaces should be observed.</description>

      <title>Exotic d-wave Bose Metal in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau Fermi liquid theory, a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, encounters limitations in explaining certain phenomena, like the peculiar behavior of strange metals in high-temperature superconductors. Non-Fermi liquids, like Bose metals with uncondensed bosonic ground state, offer potential explanations, yet constructing an elusive Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a formidable challenge. Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal in a highly anisotropic regime (a &lt; 0.30) with wide range of filling, most notably at a filling fraction of n~0.8. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of dxy correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>

      <title>Superconducting meron phase in locally noncentrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory of the superconducting parity transition is extended by incorporating the vortex degree of freedom. We employ the bilayer Rashba model representing locally noncentrosymmetric layered superconductors and derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional. This formulation reveals the parity transition, where the even-parity superconducting state changes to the odd-parity one upon increasing the magnetic field under the vortex states. The H-T phase diagram of CeRh${}_{2}$As${}_{2}$ is quantitatively reproduced and a novel superconducting state with a meron (half-skyrmion) lattice pseudospin texture is predicted.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity near 70 K in boron-carbon clathrates MB$_2$C$_8$ (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the first boron-carbon (B-C) clathrate SrB$_3$C$_3$ and the ternary borohydride KB$_2$H$_8$ [Miao et al., Phys. Rev. B 104 L100504 (2021)], we have performed first-principles density functional theory calculations of the electronic and phonon band structures for B-C compounds MB$_2$C$_8$ (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs). Our calculations reveal that these materials are dynamically stable and can potentially exhibit superconductivity at ambient pressure. However, only the K, Rb, and Cs compounds exhibit thermodynamic stability below 50 GPa, while NaB$_2$C$_8$ remains thermodynamically unstable at all pressures considered. Based on the Allen and Dynes modified McMillan equation, we predict the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of these compounds to be over 65 K at ambient pressure, with $T_c$ decreasing under higher pressures. Remarkably, we find CsB$_2$C$_8$ possesses the highest predicted $T_c$ of 68.76 K. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of high temperature superconductivity in cubic MB$_2$C$_8$ at ambient pressure, expanding the B-C clathrate superconductor family. These results provide valuable insights to guide the identification of new atmospheric pressure superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional topological insulators often rely on band inversions driven by nonuniform hopping textures and spin-orbit coupling, as exemplified in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Kane-Mele models. We present a novel approach utilizing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry to induce nontrivial topological insulating properties characterized by second-order corner states without band inversion. To substantiate our proposal, we design a photonic crystal with non primitive translational symmetry, demonstrating unique directional waveguide edge modes and localized corner modes.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency pairing of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductor junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a superconductor Josephson junction with a Bogoliubov Fermi surface, employing McMillan's Green's function technique. The low-energy degrees of freedom are described by spinless fermions (bogolons), where the characteristic feature appears as an odd-frequency pair potential. The differential equation of the Green's function is reduced to the eigenvalue problem of the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. The physical quantities such as the density of states and pair amplitude are then extracted from the obtained Green's function. We find that the zero energy local density of states at the interface decreases as the relative phase of the Josephson junction increases. This decrease is accompanied by the generation of an even-frequency pair amplitude near the interface. We also clarify that the $\pi$-junction-like current phase relation is realized in terms of bogolons. In contrast to conventional $s$-wave superconductor junctions, where even-frequency pairs dominate in the bulk and odd-frequency pairs are generated near the interface, our findings illuminate the distinct behaviors of junctions with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We further explore spatial dependences of these physical quantities systematically using quasiclassical Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spatial patterns and synchronization in superconducting time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a time crystal phase characterized by a frequency half of the driving frequency in disordered superconductors by employing the time dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism at zero temperature with a periodically driven coupling constant. After a period of exponential increase of spatial inhomogeneities and exponential suppression of the order parameter amplitude, the time crystal develops islands of different sizes. Each of these islands is a time crystal with the same frequency albeit with a phase shift $\pi$ with respect to the homogeneous time crystal. After its emergence, the island gradually becomes smaller, though the phase shift persists, until it is abruptly synchronized at a time that it depends on its initial size. We find a critical disorder strength, still deep in the metallic phase, at which the time crystal phase terminates. For even stronger disorder, the order parameter oscillates with the driving frequency in regions where localization effects are not important.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductors: The role of long-range Coulomb interaction and signatures in density response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate collective excitations in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states of Pauli-limited superconducting films. When the long-range Coulomb interaction is absent, excitation spectra consist of two gapless and three gapped modes. The gapless modes are the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of the ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry and the translational symmetry. The gapped modes include the Higgs mode and the twofold degenerate modes that cause the oscillation of the domain width and grayness of FFLO nodal planes. We find that the long-range Coulomb interaction only gaps out the gapless phase mode through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, while the other modes remain unaffected. Furthermore, the field evolution of the dispersion of the gapless elastic mode, the Nambu-Goldstone mode associated with the translational symmetry breaking, is associated with that of the bandwidth of the mid-gap Andreev bound states. We demonstrate that the signature of the elastic mode can be detected by measuring the density-density response function.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear paraconductivity in bilayer multiphase superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film multiphase superconductors are attracting much attention, and it is an important issue to propose how to detect them in experiments. In this work, we study the linear and nonlinear paraconductivity of a bilayer model with staggered Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling with and without the potential gradient. This model shows the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer phase, pair-density-wave phase, and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, and we focus on how their properties are encoded to the charge transport. We show that the linear paraconductivity has a peak associated with the phase transitions between different superconducting states due to the degeneracy of the transition temperatures as well as the paramagnetic depairing effect. We also show that the FFLO superconducting state shows a sizable nonlinear paraconductivity once the degeneracy of Cooper pairs is lifted by applying the potential gradient. Observation of the peaked linear and nonlinear paraconductivity can be used as a probe of multiphase superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Search for inhomogeneous Meissner screening in Nb induced by low-temperature surface treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical surface treatments, such as low-temperature baking (LTB) in a gaseous atmosphere or in vacuum, are important for the surface preparation of Nb superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. These treatments inhomogeneously dope the first $\sim$50 nm of Nb's subsurface and are expected to impart depth-dependent characteristics to its Meissner response; however, direct evidence supporting this remains elusive, suggesting the effect is subtle. In this work, we revisit the Meissner profile data for several LTB treatments obtained from low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mu$SR) experiments [A. Romanenko et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 072601 (2014) and R. M. L. McFadden et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 044018 (2023)], and search for signatures of inhomogeneous field screening. Using a generalized London expression with a recently proposed empirical model for a depth-dependent magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(z)$, we obtain improved fits to the Meissner data, revealing that the presence of a non-superconducting surface "dead layer" $d \geq 25$ nm is a strong indicator of a reduced supercurrent density at shallow subsurface depths. Our analysis supports the notion that vacuum annealing at 120 $^{\circ}$C for 48 h induces a depth-dependent Meissner response, which has consequences for Nb's ability to maintain a magnetic-flux-free state. Evidence of similar behavior from a "nitrogen infusion" treatment is less compelling. Suggestions for further investigation into the matter are provided.</description>

      <title>Tuning monolayer superconductivity in twisted NbSe$_2$ graphene heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advent of artificial structures has triggered the emergence of fascinating phenomena that could not exist in natural compounds. A prime example is twisted multilayers, i.e., moir\'e superlattices represented by magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). As in the case of MATBG, unconventional band hybridization can induce a new type of superconductivity: artificial band engineering by twist induces properties different from the original systems. Here, we apply this perspective to a monolayer superconductor NbSe$_2$ stacked with a twist on doped graphene. We show that the superconducting states of the NbSe$_2$ layer change dramatically by varying the twist angle. Our result shows that twist tuning, in addition to substrate effects, will provide a strategy for designing monolayer superconductors with high controllability.</description>

      <title>Twisted Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the superconducting NbSe$_2$ monolayer on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting properties of layered materials can be controlled by thinning, stacking, and twisting, demanding investigation of electronic states by spectroscopic means at the nanometer scale. Here, we reveal the spatial variations of the electronic states in heterostructures of the superconducting monolayer NbSe$_2$/graphene using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. The NbSe$_2$ monolayer grown by molecular beam epitaxy is naturally twisted with respect to the graphene substrate and exhibits interference patterns of Bogoliubov quasiparticles twisted with respect to the NbSe$_2$ and graphene lattices. We find that the twisted interference patterns originate from a sextet of regions in momentum space where the Fermi surfaces of NbSe$_2$ and graphene overlap. The Fermi surface overlap is sensitive to the twist angle, providing a knob to tune superconductivity.</description>

      <title>The Non-collinear Path to Topological Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining spin textures in ultra-thin films with conventional superconductors has emerged as a powerful and versatile platform for designing topologically non-trivial superconducting phases as well as spin-triplet Cooper pairs. As a consequence, two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrids (2D MSHs) are promising candidate systems to realize devices for topology-based quantum technologies and superconducting spintronics. So far, studies have focused mostly on systems hosting collinear ferromagnets or antiferromagnets. However, topologically non-trivial phases have been predicted to emerge in MSH systems with non-collinear spin textures as well. In this article, we present the experimental discovery of topological superconductivity in the MSH system Fe/Ta(110) where a magnetic spiral is realized in the Fe monolayer on the surface of the s-wave superconductor Ta. By combining low-temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements with theoretical modeling, we are able to conclude that the system is in a topological nodal-point superconducting phase with low-energy edge modes. Due to the non-collinear spin texture in our MSH system, these edge modes exhibit a magnetization direction-dependent dispersion. Furthermore, we identify direct signatures of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the experimentally measured differential tunneling conductance. The present work realizes a non-collinear spin texture-based path to topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating charge-density-wave correlations in the three-band Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature superconducting cuprates host unidirectional spin- and charge-density-wave orders that can intertwine with superconductivity in non-trivial ways. While the charge components of these stripes have now been observed in nearly all cuprate families, their detailed evolution with doping varies across different materials and at high and low temperatures. We address this problem using non-perturbative determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the three-band Hubbard model. Using an efficient implementation, we can resolve the model's fluctuating spin and charge modulations and map their evolution as a function of the charge transfer energy and doping. We find that the incommensurability of the charge modulations is decoupled from the spin modulations and decreases with hole doping, consistent with experimental measurements at high temperatures. These findings support the proposal that the high-temperature charge correlations are distinct from the intertwined stripe order observed at low-temperature and in the single-band Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Gate and flux tunable $\sin(2\varphi)$ Josephson element in proximitized junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson field-effect transistors (JoFETs) function as Josephson junctions with a gate-tunable critical current. Additionally, they can feature a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation (CPR) containing multiple harmonics of the superconducting phase difference, a so-far underutilized property. In this work, we exploit this multi-harmonicity to create a Josephson circuit element with an almost perfectly $\pi$-periodic CPR, indicative of a largely dominant charge-4e supercurrent transport. Such a Josephson element was recently proposed as the basic building block of a protected superconducting qubit. Here, it is realized using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with low-inductance aluminum arms and two nominally identical JoFETs. The latter are fabricated from a SiGe/Ge/SiGe quantum-well heterostructure embedding a high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas. By carefully adjusting the JoFET gate voltages and finely tuning the magnetic flux through the SQUID close to half a flux quantum, we achieve a regime where the $\sin(2\varphi)$ component accounts for more than \SI{95}{\percent} of the total supercurrent. This result demonstrates a new promising route for the realization of superconducting qubits with enhanced coherence properties.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e materials have enabled the realization of flat electron bands and quantum phases that are driven by strong correlations associated with flat bands. Superconductivity has been observed, but solely, in graphene moir\'e materials. The absence of robust superconductivity in moir\'e materials beyond graphene, such as semiconductor moir\'e materials, has remained a mystery and challenged our current understanding of superconductivity in flat bands. Here, we report the observation of robust superconductivity in 3.65-degree twisted bilayer WSe2 which hosts a honeycomb moir\'e lattice. Superconductivity emerges at half-band filling and under small sublattice potential differences, where the moir\'e band is a flat Chern band. The optimal superconducting transition temperature is about 220 mK and constitutes 2% of the effective Fermi temperature; the latter is comparable to the value in high-temperature cuprate superconductors and suggests strong pairing. The superconductor borders on two distinct metals below and above half-band filling; it undergoes a continuous transition to a correlated insulator by tuning the sublattice potential difference. The observed superconductivity on the verge of Coulomb-induced charge localization suggests roots in strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Molecular Hydrogen in the N-doped LuH3 System: a Possible Path to Superconductivity?</title>

Abstract: The discovery of ambient superconductivity would mark an epochal breakthrough long-awaited for over a century, potentially ushering in unprecedented scientific and technological advancements. The recent findings on high-temperature superconducting phases in various hydrides under high pressure have ignited optimism, suggesting that the realization of near-ambient superconductivity might be on the horizon. However, the preparation of hydride samples tends to promote the emergence of various metastable phases, marked by a low level of experimental reproducibility. Identifying these phases through theoretical and computational methods entails formidable challenges, often resulting in controversial outcomes. In this paper, we consider N-doped LuH3 as a prototypical complex hydride: By means of machine-learning-accelerated force-field molecular dynamics, we have identified the formation of H2 molecules stabilized at ambient pressure by nitrogen impurities. Importantly, we demonstrate that this molecular phase plays a pivotal role in the emergence of a dynamically stable, low-temperature, experimental-ambient-pressure superconductivity. The potential to stabilize hydrogen in molecular form through chemical doping opens up a novel avenue for investigating disordered phases in hydrides and their transport properties under near-ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal superconductivity, also known as the superconducting diode effect, has been extensively studied in the presence of a magnetic field or some form of ferromagnetic order breaking time-reversal symmetry. We here show that another class of magnetic order known as altermagnetism, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry but does not exhibit a finite net magnetic moment, can also give rise to a superconducting diode effect. Whether this is the case depends on the combination of the system's point group and altermagnetic order parameter which we explore systematically for two-dimensional crystalline systems. If the superconducting electrons are in a centrosymmetric crystalline environment, an electric field $E_z$ (or other sources of inversion symmetry breaking) can be used to turn on and tune the non-reciprocity, yielding an electric-field tunable diode effect; there are also non-centrosymmetric point groups, which are not reached by applying $E_z \neq 0$ in a centrosymmetric crystal, but still allow for an altermagnetic order parameter with non-reciprocal superconductivity. Depending on the residual magnetic point group, the zeros of the critical current asymmetry, $J_c(\hat{n}) - J_c(-\hat{n})$, are pinned along high-symmetry crystalline directions $\hat{n}=\hat{e}_j$ or are free to rotate in the plane of the system. In some cases, the zeros can be rotated by tuning the electric field $E_z$. We discuss all of these phenomena both on the general level using exact symmetry arguments and more explicitly by constructing and solving minimal lattice models. We provide experimental setups to realize the altermagnetic superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the superconducting diode effect through inhomogeneous magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting diode device comprising a central superconducting film flanked by two wires carrying an applied DC bias, suitably chosen so as to generate different asymmetric field profiles. Through numerical simulations of the coupled Ginzburg-Landau and heat-diffusion equations, we show that this design is capable of efficiently breaking the reciprocity of the critical current in the central superconductor, thus promoting the diode effect in response to an applied AC current. By adjusting the DC bias in the wires, we find the optimum inhomogeneous field profile that facilitates the entrance of vortices and antivortices in a given polarity of the applied AC current and impede their entrance in the other polarity. This way, the system behaves as an ideal superconducting half-wave rectifier, with diode efficiencies surpassing 70%. Furthermore, we detail the behavior and diode efficiency of the system under different experimental conditions, such as the substrate heat transfer coefficient and the sweep rate of the external current.</description>

      <title>A universal phenomenology of charge-spin interconversion and dynamics in diffusive systems with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory for a unified description of transport in normal and superconducting metals in the presence of generic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The structure of the quantum kinetic theory in the diffusive regime is determined by a set of fundamental constraints -- charge conjugation symmetry, the causality principle, and the crystal symmetry of a material. These symmetries uniquely fix the action of the Keldysh non-linear $\sigma$ model (NLSM), which at the saddle point yields the quantum kinetic Usadel-type equation. Our phenomenological approach is reminiscent of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, but is valid for superconductors in the whole temperature range, describes the diffusive transport in the normal state, and naturally captures the effects of superconducting fluctuations. As an application, we derive the NLSM and quantum transport equations which include all effects of spin-orbit coupling, allowed by the crystal symmetry, for example, the spin Hall, spin current swapping or spin-galvanic effects. Our approach can be extended to systems with broken time reversal symmetry, as well as to the description of hybrid interfaces, where the spin-charge interconversion can be enhanced due to strong interfacial SOC.</description>

      <title>Photon-Pressure with an Effective Negative Mass Microwave Mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harmonic oscillators belong to the most fundamental concepts in physics and are central to many current research fields such as circuit QED, cavity optomechanics and photon-pressure systems. Here, we engineer a microwave mode in a superconducting LC circuit that mimics the dynamics of a negative mass oscillator, and couple it via photon-pressure to a second low-frequency circuit. We demonstrate that the effective negative mass dynamics lead to an inversion of dynamical backaction and to sideband-cooling of the low-frequency circuit by a blue-detuned pump field, which can be intuitively understood by the inverted energy ladder of a negative mass oscillator.</description>

      <title>Programmable XY-type couplings through parallel spin-dependent forces on the same trapped ion motional modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an analog scheme for generating XY-type ($J_{ij}^x \sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ + $J_{ij}^y \sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$) Hamiltonians on trapped ion spins with independent control over the $J_{ij}^x$ and $J_{ij}^y$ terms. The Ising-type interactions $\sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ and $\sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$ are simultaneously generated by employing two spin-dependent forces operating in parallel on the same set of normal modes. We analytically calculate the region of validity of this scheme, and provide numerical and experimental validation with $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+\;$ ions. This scheme inherits the programmability and scalability of the Ising-type interactions with trapped ions that have been explored in numerous quantum simulation experiments. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing trapped ion quantum simulators to access a large class of spin Hamiltonians relevant for exploring exotic quantum phases such as superfluidity and spin liquids.</description>

      <title>First principle prediction of structural distortions in the cuprates and their impact on the electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials-realistic microscopic theoretical descriptions of copper-based superconductors are challenging due to their complex crystal structures combined with strong electron interactions. Here, we demonstrate how density functional theory can accurately describe key structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the normal state of the prototypical cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212). We emphasize the importance of accounting for energy-lowering structural distortions, which then allows us to: (a) accurately describe the insulating antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the undoped parent compound (in contrast to the metallic state predicted by previous {\it ab initio} studies); (b) identify numerous low-energy competing spin and charge stripe orders in the hole-overdoped material nearly degenerate in energy with the AFM ordered state, indicating strong spin fluctuations; (c) predict the lowest-energy hole-doped crystal structure including its long-range structural distortions and oxygen dopant positions that match high-resolution scanning microscopy measurements; and (d) describe electronic bands near the Fermi energy with flat antinodal dispersions and Fermi surfaces that in agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and provide a clear explanation for the structural origins of the so-called ``shadow bands''. We also show how one must go beyond band theory and include fully dynamic spin fluctuations via a many-body approach when aiming to make quantitative predictions to measure the ARPES spectra in the overdoped material.</description>

      <title>Robust $T$-Linear Resistivity due to SU(4) Valley + Spin Fluctuation Mechanism in Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), non-Fermi liquid like transport phenomena are universally observed. To understand their origin, we perform the self-consistent analysis of the self-energy due to SU(4) valley + spin fluctuations induced by the electron-electron correlation. In the SU(4) fluctuation mechanism, the fifteen channels of fluctuations contribute additively to the self-energy. Therefore, the SU(4) fluctuation mechanism gives much higher electrical resistance than the spin fluctuation mechanism. By the same reason, SU(4) fluctuations of intermediate strength provide $T$-linear resistivity down to $\sim1$K. Interestingly, the $T$-linear resistivity is robustly realizedfor wide range of electron filling, even away from the van-Hove filling. This study provides a strong evidence for the importance of electron-electron correlation in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Majorana modes in trapped-ion system and their Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obeying non-Abelian statistics, Majorana fermions holds a promise to implement fault-tolerant quantum computing. It was found that Majorana fermions can be simulated by the zero-energy excitation in a nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling interacting with an $s$-wave superconductor under a magnetic field. However, the signal of Majorana fermion in that system is obscured by the disorder in the nanowire and the confinement potential at the wire end. Thus, more controllable platforms are desired to simulate Majorana fermions. We here propose an alternative scheme to simulate the Majorana fermions in a trapped-ion system. Our dimerized-ion configuration permits us to generate the Majorana modes not only at zero energy but also at the nonzero ones, which enlarge the family of Majorana modes and supply another qubit carrier for quantum computing. We also investigate the controllability of the Majorana modes by Floquet engineering. It is found that a widely tunable number of Majorana modes are created on demand by applying a periodic driving on the trapped-ion system. Enriching the platforms for simulating Majorana fermions, our result would open another avenue for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>
