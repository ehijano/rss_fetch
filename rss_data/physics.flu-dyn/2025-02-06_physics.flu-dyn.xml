      <title>Classical 1/3 Nusselt number scaling in highly turbulent compressible convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary and stellar convection, which are compressible and turbulent, remain poorly understood. In this paper, we report numerical results on the scaling of Nusselt number ($\mathrm{Nu}$) and Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re}$) for extreme convection. Using computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD finite difference method, we simulate compressible turbulent convection in a two-dimensional Cartesian box up to $\mathrm{Ra} = 10^{16}$, the highest $\mathrm{Ra}$ achieved so far, and in a three-dimensional box up to $\mathrm{Ra} = 10^{11}$. We show adiabatic temperature drop in the bulk flow, leading to the Reynolds number scaling $\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$. More significantly, we show classical $1/3$ Nusselt number scaling: $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{0.32}$ in 2D, and $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{0.31}$ in 3D up to the highest $\mathrm{Ra}$.</description>

      <title>Scalar probability density function mixing models need not comply with the linearity and independence hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a mixture of scalar fields undergoing diffusive processes governed by Fick's law, the concentration at each point evolves linearly in the concentrations at all points and independently from the other concentrations, when one considers a finite differences integration of their evolution equations. However, these properties must not necessarily be enforced in probability density function models, since they are relaxed when conditional expected values are taken.</description>

      <title>Response of liquid metal in a fusion reactor blanket to rapid variation of magnetic field during a transient plasma event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient plasma events, such as plasma disruptions, are anticipated in the future magnetic-confinement nuclear fusion reactors. The events are accompanied by a rapid change in the magnetic field generated by the plasma current and, accordingly, induction of strong eddy currents and Lorentz forces within the reactor structure. This work targets processes within liquid-metal components of the reactor's breeding blankets. Order-of-magnitude analysis and numerical simulations are performed to understand the response of liquid metal to a rapidly changing magnetic field and to evaluate the accuracy of commonly used simplifying model assumptions. The response is found to consist of two stages: an initial brief stage ($\sim 1$ ms) characterized by a rapid increase in the induced currents, forces, and fluid velocity; and a subsequent stage, which is triggered by the growing velocity of the metal and marked by reversals of Lorentz force, and oscillations and decreases in the amplitude of the induced fields. The transition to the second stage sets the upper limit of the velocity ($\sim 0.5$ m/s in our tests), to which an initially quiescent metal can be accelerated during the event. The simulations indicate that many widely used model assumptions, such as the negligible role of Joule dissipation in the heat balance and the constancy of physical property coefficients, remain valid during the response. However, the assumption of liquid metal incompressibility is found to be questionable due to the potential significant effects of pressure waves.</description>

      <title>Implementation of integral surface tension formulations in a volume of fluid framework and their applications to Marangoni flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate numerical modeling of surface tension has been a challenging aspect of multiphase flow simulations. The integral formulation for modeling surface tension forces is known to be consistent and conservative, and to be a natural choice for the simulation of flows driven by surface tension gradients along the interface. This formulation was introduced by Popinet and Zaleski (1999) for a front-tracking method and was later extended to level set methods by Al-Saud et al. (2018). In this work, we extend the integral formulation to a volume of fluid (VOF) method for capturing the interface. In fact, we propose three different schemes distinguished by the way we calculate the geometric properties of the interface, namely curvature, tangent vector and surface fraction from VOF representation. We propose a coupled level set volume of fluid (CLSVOF) method in which we use a signed distance function coupled with VOF, a height function (HF) method in which we use the height functions calculated from VOF, and a height function to distance (HF2D) method in which we use a sign-distance function calculated from height functions. For validation, these methods are rigorously tested for several problems with constant as well as varying surface tension. It is found that from an accuracy standpoint, CLSVOF has the least numerical oscillations followed by HF2D and then HF. However, from a computational speed point of view, HF method is the fastest followed by HF2D and then CLSVOF. Therefore, the HF2D method is a good compromise between speed and accuracy for obtaining faster and correct results.</description>

      <title>Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. Instead, one could require the continuity of all components of the viscous stress tensor on the interface without exception. In this paper, it is shown that this approach gives a droplet velocity that coincides with the Stokes drag force formula for a sphere of a given radius.</description>

      <title>Turbulent transport in a non-Markovian velocity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commonly used quasilinear approximation allows one to calculate the turbulent transport coefficients for the mean of a passive scalar or a magnetic field in a given velocity field. Formally, the quasilinear approximation is exact when the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. We calculate the lowest-order corrections to the transport coefficients due to the correlation time being nonzero. For this, we use the Furutsu-Novikov theorem, which allows one to express the turbulent transport coefficients in a Gaussian random velocity field as a series in the correlation time. We find that the turbulent diffusivities of both the mean passive scalar and the mean magnetic field are suppressed. Nevertheless, contradicting a previous study, we show that the turbulent diffusivity of the mean magnetic field is smaller than that of the mean passive scalar. We also find corrections to the $\alpha$ effect.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Gromeka Acceleration Vector for Dimensionless Womersley Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02969v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents an analytical and theoretical investigation of the Gromeka acceleration field in a dimensionless Womersley flow, derived through the exact solution of the governing Navier-Stokes equations in phase space. By decomposing the convective acceleration into rotational and nonrotational components, the derivation highlights the dominant role of vorticity dynamics near the wall, where steep velocity gradients interact with the oscillatory axial velocity to produce localized radial accelerations. The solution reveals that the Gromeka acceleration mediates nonlinear interactions between harmonics, driving energy redistribution and boundary layer development under multi-harmonic boundary conditions. Complementary analysis of the kinetic energy gradient further delineates inertial effects, demonstrating their role in phase-dependent flow separation and reattachment. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding momentum transport and instability generation in pulsatile wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing 3D Flow from 2D Data with Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid flow is a widely applied physical problem, crucial in various fields. Due to the highly nonlinear and chaotic nature of fluids, analyzing fluid-related problems is exceptionally challenging. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the best tool for this analysis but involves significant computational resources, especially for 3D simulations, which are slow and resource-intensive. In experimental fluid dynamics, PIV cost increases with dimensionality. Reconstructing 3D flow fields from 2D PIV data could reduce costs and expand application scenarios. Here, We propose a Diffusion Transformer-based method for reconstructing 3D flow fields from 2D flow data. By embedding the positional information of 2D planes into the model, we enable the reconstruction of 3D flow fields from any combination of 2D slices, enhancing flexibility. We replace global attention with window and plane attention to reduce computational costs associated with higher dimensions without compromising performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our model can efficiently and accurately reconstruct 3D flow fields from 2D data, producing realistic results.</description>

      <title>Physically Interpretable Representation and Controlled Generation for Turbulence Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays a pivotal role in fluid mechanics, enabling precise simulations of fluid behavior through partial differential equations (PDEs). However, traditional CFD methods are resource-intensive, particularly for high-fidelity simulations of complex flows, which are further complicated by high dimensionality, inherent stochasticity, and limited data availability. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a data-driven approach that leverages a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) to encode high-dimensional scientific data into low-dimensional, physically meaningful representations. The GMVAE learns a structured latent space where data can be categorized based on physical properties such as the Reynolds number while maintaining global physical consistency. To assess the interpretability of the learned representations, we introduce a novel metric based on graph spectral theory, quantifying the smoothness of physical quantities along the latent manifold. We validate our approach using 2D Navier-Stokes simulations of flow past a cylinder over a range of Reynolds numbers. Our results demonstrate that the GMVAE provides improved clustering, meaningful latent structure, and robust generative capabilities compared to baseline dimensionality reduction methods. This framework offers a promising direction for data-driven turbulence modeling and broader applications in computational fluid dynamics and engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative thermodynamic analyses of nucleation, evolution and stabilization of surface nanobubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface nanobubbles are complex micro- and nanoscale fluid systems. While thermodynamics is believed to dominate nanobubble dynamics, the precise mechanism by which nanobubble evolution is driven by thermodynamics remains unclear. It is essential to understand how nanobubble nucleation and growth, nanoscale contact line movement, and gas diffusion across the liquid-bubble interface are simultaneously driven by the change in free energy, leading to the ultimate thermodynamic equilibrium of surface nanobubble systems. In this paper, we first propose a quantitative theoretical model to elucidate the thermodynamic dominance behind the dynamics and stability of the fluid system with surface nanobubbles. The present model demonstrates that thermodynamic non-equilibrium drives the gas diffusion and the contact line motion of surface nanobubbles. Overcoming the nucleation energy barrier is crucial for bubble nucleation and growth. Surface nanobubbles evolve towards the reduction of the system's free energy and stabilize at the state with minimum free energy. The thermodynamic equilibrium is accompanied by the mechanical equilibrium at the contact line and the gas diffusion equilibrium at the liquid-bubble interface, and the theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the nanobubble morphology observed in experiments. The study highlights the significant influence of gas properties and ambient conditions in promoting bubble nucleation and stability.</description>

      <title>Flashback propensity due to hydrogen blending in natural gas: sensitivity to operating and geometrical parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen has emerged as a promising option for promoting decarbonization in various sectors by serving as a replacement for natural gas while retaining the combustion-based conversion system. However, its higher reactivity compared to natural gas introduces a significant risk of flashback. This study investigates the impact of operating and geometry parameters on flashback phenomena in multi-slit burners fed with hydrogen-methane-air mixtures. For this purpose, transient numerical simulations, which take into account conjugate heat transfer between the fluid and the solid walls, are coupled with stochastic sensitivity analysis based on Generalized Polynomial Chaos. This allows deriving comprehensive maps of flashback velocities and burner temperatures within the parameter space of hydrogen content, equivalence ratio, and slit width, using a limited number of numerical simulations. Moreover, we assess the influence of different parameters and their interactions on flashback propensity. The ranges we investigate encompass highly H2-enriched lean mixtures, ranging from 80\% to 100\% H2 by volume, with equivalence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.0. We also consider slit widths that are typically encountered in burners for end-user devices, ranging from 0.5 mm to 1.2 mm. The study highlights the dominant role of preferential diffusion in affecting flashback physics and propensity as parameters vary, including significant enrichment close to the burner plate due to the Soret effect. These findings hold promise for driving the design and optimization of perforated burners, enabling their safe and efficient operation in practical end-user applications.</description>

      <title>Spectrum correction on Ekman-Navier-Stokes equation in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of a linear friction drag affects significantly the dynamics of turbulent flows in two-dimensions. At small scales, it induces a correction to the slope of the energy spectrum in the range of wavenumbers corresponding to the direct enstrophy cascade. Simple arguments predict that this correction is proportional to the ratio of the friction coefficient to the characteristic deformation rate of the flow. In this work, we examine this phenomenon by means of a set of GPU-accelerated numerical simulations at high resolutions, varying both the Reynolds number and the friction coefficient. Exploiting the relation between the energy spectrum and the enstrophy flux, we obtain accurate measurements of the spectral scaling exponents. Our results show that the exponent of the spectral correction follows a universal linear law in which the friction coefficient is rescaled by the enstrophy injection rate.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of vortex cap solutions on the rotating unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analytically study the existence of periodic vortex cap solutions for the homogeneous and incompressible Euler equations on the rotating unit 2-sphere, which was numerically conjectured by Dritschel-Polvani and Kim-Sakajo-Sohn. Such solutions are piecewise constant vorticity distributions, subject to the Gauss constraint and rotating uniformly around the vertical axis. The proof is based on the bifurcation from zonal solutions given by spherical caps. For the one--interface case, the bifurcation eigenvalues correspond to Burbea's frequencies obtained in the planar case but shifted by the rotation speed of the sphere. The two--interfaces case (also called band type or strip type solutions) is more delicate. Though, for any fixed large enough symmetry, and under some non-degeneracy conditions to avoid spectral collisions, we achieve the existence of at most two branches of bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Droplet impact on elastic substrates: force scaling crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet impacts are fundamental to fluid-structure interactions, shaping processes from erosion to bioprinting. While previous scaling laws have provided insights into droplet dynamics, force scaling laws remain insufficiently understood, particularly for soft substrates where both the droplet and substrate deform significantly. Here, we show that droplet impacts on elastic substrates exhibit a scaling crossover in maximum impact force, transitioning from inertial force scaling, typical for rigid substrates under high inertia, to Hertzian impact scaling, characteristic of rigid spheres on elastic substrates. Using high-speed photoelastic tomography, we captured high-resolution dynamic stress fields and identified a similarity parameter governing the interplay between droplet inertia, substrate elasticity, and deformation time scales. Our findings redefine how substrate properties influence impact forces, demonstrating that droplets under high inertia -- long thought to follow inertial force scaling -- can instead follow Hertzian impact scaling on soft substrates. This framework provides practical insights for designing soft, impact-resistant materials.</description>
