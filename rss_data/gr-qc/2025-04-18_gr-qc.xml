      <title>The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work [Van de Moortel, The breakdown of weak null singularities, Duke Mathematical Journal 172 (15), 2957-3012, 2023], we showed that dynamical black holes formed in charged spherical collapse generically feature both a null weakly singular Cauchy horizon and a stronger (presumably spacelike) singularity, confirming a longstanding conjecture in the physics literature. However, this previous result, based on a contradiction argument, did not provide quantitative estimates on the stronger singularity.
  In this study, we adopt a new approach by analyzing local initial data inside the black hole that are consistent with a breakdown of the Cauchy horizon. We prove that the remaining portion is spacelike and obtain sharp spacetime estimates near the null-spacelike transition. Notably, we show that the Kasner exponents of the spacelike portion are positive, in contrast to the well-known Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse. Moreover, these exponents degenerate to (1,0,0) towards the null-spacelike transition.
  Our result provides the first quantitative instances of a null-spacelike singularity transition inside a black hole. In our companion paper, we moreover apply our analysis to carry out the construction of a large class of asymptotically flat one or two-ended black holes featuring coexisting null and spacelike singularities.</description>

      <title>Data-driven extraction, phenomenology and modeling of eccentric harmonics in binary black hole merger waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newtonian and post-Newtonian (PN) calculations suggest that each spherical harmonic mode of the gravitational waveforms (radiation) emitted by eccentric binaries can be further decomposed into several eccentricity-induced modes (indexed by $j=1$ to $j=\infty$), referred to as eccentric harmonics. These harmonics exhibit monotonically time-varying amplitudes and instantaneous frequencies, unlike the full eccentric spherical harmonic modes. However, computing or extracting these harmonics are not straightforward in current numerical relativity (NR) simulations and eccentric waveform models. To address this, Patterson \textit{et al} have developed a framework to extract the eccentric harmonics directly from effective-one-body formalism waveforms. In this paper, we build on the ideas presented in Patterson \textit{et al} and propose a data-driven framework, utilizing singular-value decomposition (SVD), that incorporates additional features based on PN intuition to ensure monotonicity in the extracted harmonics. We further demonstrate that the phase (frequency) of these harmonics is simply $j\phi_{\lambda}+\phi_{\rm ecc}$ ($jf_{\lambda}+f_{\rm ecc}$) where $\phi_{\lambda}$ ($f_{\lambda}$) is related to the secular orbital phase (frequency) and $\phi_{\rm ecc}$ ($f_{\rm ecc}$) is an additional phase (frequency) that only depends on the eccentricity. We also provide simple analytical fits to obtain the harmonics as a function of the mean anomaly. These relations may prove useful in constructing faithful models that can be employed in cheap and efficient searches and parameter estimation of eccentric mergers. Our framework is modular and can be extended for any other eccentric waveform models or simulation frameworks. The framework is available through the \texttt{gwMiner} package.</description>

      <title>Taming systematics in distance and inclination measurements with gravitational waves: role of the detector network and higher-order modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of compact binaries have the potential to unlock several remarkable applications in astrophysics, cosmology, and nuclear physics through accurate measurements of the source luminosity distance and inclination. However, these parameters are strongly correlated when performing parameter estimation, which may hamper the enormous potential of GW astronomy. We comprehensively explore this problem by performing Bayesian inference on synthetic data for a network of current and planned second-generation GW detectors, and for the third-generation interferometer Einstein Telescope~(ET). We quantify the role of the network alignment factor, detector sensitivity, and waveform higher-order modes in breaking this degeneracy. We discuss the crucial role of the binary mass ratio: in particular, we find that ET can efficiently remove the error in the distance as long as the compact binary is asymmetric in mass.</description>

      <title>Circular orbits and accretion disk around a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and electrically charged particles in the vicinity of a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To examine the motion of an electrically charged test particle, we propose an expression for electromagnetic 4-potential that contains the impacts of loop quantum gravity. This electromagnetic 4-potential satisfies approximately the covariant Maxwell's equations to first order in the loop quantum effects. We explore the effects of the loop quantum correction parameter on the particle geodesics. We investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for both neutral and electrically charged particles in detail, demonstrating that the loop quantum parameter significantly influences on the ISCO radius, causing it to shrink. Finally, we explore the accretion disk around the loop quantum black hole. We delve into the electromagnetic radiation flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and the spectral luminosity as radiation properties of the accretion disk in detail. We show that the loop quantum correction parameter shifts the profile of the electromagnetic flux and accretion disk temperature towards the central object, leading to a slight increase in these quantities.</description>

      <title>The Sky as a Killing Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group and related topics in infrared physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons (or "asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes"). New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Quasinormal Modes of Brane-Localized Reissner-Nordstr\"om--de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field propagating on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om--de Sitter (RNdS) black hole black hole background on a 3+1-dimensional brane embedded in a higher-dimensional world. Using the WKB method supplemented with Pad\'e approximants and validated by time-domain integration via the Prony method, we compute the dominant quasinormal frequencies for a wide range of black hole and field parameters. We show that the presence of the cosmological constant, black hole charge, and bulk dimensionality significantly affect the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of the scalar perturbations. In particular, we observe the emergence of long lived modes and slowly decaying oscillatory tails in the regime of large field mass. The results demonstrate good agreement between the frequency- and time-domain methods, reinforcing the reliability of the semi-analytic approach in this context.</description>

      <title>Hodge Dual Gauge Symmetry in Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein-aether gravity is a theory that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry by introducing a preferred direction via a vector field, which is considered to play the role of an aether. The theory is identified by four coupling constants between the aether and gravity. Minimal Einstein-aether is the special case in which only one of the couplings is non-zero. We show that the aether vector field in its minimal version is Hodge dual to a gauge field. The gauge symmetry in the dual description has been known for decades and has been used to implement a cosmological constant into the Lagrangian. As a result, solutions to the well-established gauge theory can be transferred into the minimal Einstein-aether theory straightforwardly. On the other hand, some of the proposed solutions to the minimal Einstein-aether theory could be discarded as pure gauges of the vanishing aether. We prove as a theorem that this holds true for all divergence-less aether fields.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving accelerated detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111, 045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of former Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in shifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift parameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift parameter, provided it is non-vanishing. We investigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Greybody Factors of Scalar Field Perturbations in the NED Corrected Charged Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the quark-antiquark confinement potential, Mazharimousavi et al. \cite{Mazharimousavi:2023okd} proposed a nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) model, and based on this model, they constructed a charged black hole solution that includes a logarithmic correction term ($\propto \frac{\zeta \ln r}{r}$). On the basis of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, this solution realizes a long-range confinement correction by introducing the NED parameter $\zeta$, providing a new theoretical perspective for explaining the anomalies in galaxy rotation curves. To deeply explore the dynamic properties of this black hole solution, this paper combines two complementary methods, namely, time-domain evolution and the WKB approximation, to calculate the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of its scalar field perturbations. The research results show that the oscillation frequencies and decay rates of the low-order QNM modes decrease monotonically with the increase of the NED parameter $\zeta$, and exhibit an approximately linear dependence. The analysis of the greybody factor (GF) indicates that as $\zeta$ increases, the transmittance of the low-frequency scalar field also increases. The enhanced long-range confinement effect caused by the increase of $\zeta$ makes low-frequency perturbations more likely to survive and propagate in space-time on the one hand, and at the same time enhances the transmission ability of the low-frequency scalar field. These characteristics provide key theoretical predictions and potential observational features for testing and constraining such NED models in a strong gravitational field environment in the future using the observational data of gravitational wave astronomy or Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Thermodynamics and Lyapunov Exponents of Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS black holes via the Euclidean path integral method, incorporating appropriate boundary and counterterms. By analyzing unstable timelike and null circular geodesics, we demonstrate that their Lyapunov exponents reflect the thermodynamic phase structure obtained from the Euclidean action. Specifically, the small-large black hole phase transition, analogous to a van der Waals fluid, is signaled by a discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent. Treating this discontinuity as an order parameter, we observe a universal critical exponent of $1/2$, consistent with mean-field theory. These results extend previous insights from black hole spacetimes with Abelian charges to scenarios involving nonlinear, non-Abelian gauge fields, highlighting the interplay between black hole thermodynamics and chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Retarded Causal Set Propagator in 2D Anti de-Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of Causal Set Theory (CST) as a framework for discretizing $(1+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS$_{1+1}$). In CST, spacetime is modeled as a locally finite, partially ordered set that reflects the causal structure of events. This fundamentally discrete perspective has shown promise in flat spacetime scenarios, while its application to curved geometries is a current field of study. We address this by studying the retarded scalar field propagator on causal sets generated by Poisson sprinkling in AdS$_{1+1}$. We first show the solution of the continuum propagator using the Klein-Gordon equation, solved in terms of geodesic distance. On the discrete side, we employ Shumans path sum method to derive the corresponding propagator, emphasizing that it is valid even in curved manifolds. By performing numerical simulations, we compare the discrete propagator to its continuum counterpart across various curvature scales. Our results show strong agreement and confirm that the causal set propagator accurately captures the effects of curvature without requiring modifications to the flat-space jump amplitudes. These findings affirm the robustness of CST in approximating field propagation in curved spacetimes and strongly support the ability of causal sets to fully capture the geometry of Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Physical limits on information metrics and quantum gravity as gravitized quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long history in both general relativity and quantum mechanics of removing fixed background structures, thereby making observed objects and measurement processes dynamical. We continue this evolution by combining central insights from both theories to argue that physical limits on information collection resulting from quantum gravity coupled with general covariance preclude the fixed information geometry still assumed in both information theory and quantum mechanics. As a consequence there must be a gravitized, generally covariant extension of both theories. We also propose a novel experimental test involving intrinsic triple and higher order quantum interferences that would provide evidence for dynamical information metrics and a dynamical Born rule.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Geometric Invariants in the Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Setting: Energy and Linear Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of geometric invariants, as defined by Michel \cite{Michel}, in the context of asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets. Our focus lies on the charges of energy and linear momentum, and we study their behavior under the Einstein evolution equations. We construct foliations describing the evolution of asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets using hyperboloidal time function. We define E-P chargeability as a property of the initial data set, and we show that it is preserved under the evolution for our choice of time function. This ensures that the charges are well-defined along the evolution, which is crucial for our approach. Along such foliations, we recover the same energy-loss and linear momentum-loss formulae as those derived by Bondi, Sachs, and Metzner \cite{Bondi-vanderBurg-Metzner} while operating under weaker asymptotic assumptions. Our approach is distinct from previous work as we do not utilize conformal compactifications and work directly at the level of the initial data set.</description>

      <title>Palatini Linear Attractors Are Back in ACTion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.9743$, in excellent agreement with the prediction of linear inflation. However, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.0667$ is in tension with current observational bounds. In this work, we investigate how this tension can be alleviated in the Palatini formulation of gravity. We consider two classes of models based on simple monomial potentials: (i) models with a non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and gravity, and (ii) models including an $\alpha R^2$ term. In the first case, we find that a quadratic potential with a linear non-minimal coupling leads to the linear inflation attractor, with $r$ suppressed as $\xi$ increases. In the second case, we show that a linear potential can yield values of $r$ consistent with observations for sufficiently large $\alpha$. Our results demonstrate that simple monomial models can remain compatible with current observational constraints when embedded in the Palatini framework.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter, Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of ({\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of such {\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\bf qgcs} in inflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.</description>

      <title>Radiative properties of a nonsingular black hole: Hawking radiation and gray-body factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radiative properties of a spherical and singularity-free black-hole geometry recently proposed in the literature. Contrary to the Schwarzschild spacetime, this geometry is geodesically complete and regular, and, instead of the singularity, it presents a minimal surface that connects a trapped (black-hole) with an antitrapped (white-hole) region. The geometry is characterized by two parameters: the Schwarzschild radius and another parameter that measures the area of the minimal surface. This parameter is related to certain corrections expected in the context of loop quantum gravity to the classical general-relativistic dynamics. We explicitly compute the spectrum of the Hawking radiation and the gray-body factor. Since the gravitational potential is shallower than in Schwarzschild, the emission spectrum turns out be colder and purer (less gray). From this, we sketch the evaporation history of this geometry and conclude that, instead of completely evaporating, it naturally leads to a remnant, which provides a possible resolution of the information loss issue.</description>

      <title>Proca theory of four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet gravity and black holes with primary hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, well-defined four-dimensional regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity by applying a dimensional regularization procedure. The resulting theory is a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class. We then consider the static spherically symmetric solutions of this theory and find black hole solutions that acquire primary hair. Notably, one of the integration constants associated with the Proca field is not manifest in the original metric, but under a disformal transformation of the seed solution, it emerges as a second, independent primary hair. This additional hair acts as an effective cosmological constant in the disformed geometry, even in the absence of a bare cosmological constant term. We further generalize these black hole solutions to include electromagnetic charges and effects related to the scalar-tensor counterparts of the regularized Gauss-Bonnet theory. We discuss the implications of our findings to observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic study of the Starobinsky-Higgs inflation model in the presence of an additional cubic term of the Ricci scalar. We investigate, in particular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we show that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility with cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct observational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we discuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including the scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an independent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of Eccentricity on Accreting Binary Black Holes: MHD Simulations in Full GR Reveal Novel Periodicities in Jet Power and Synchrotron Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform simulations of magnetohydrodynamic accretion onto equal-mass, non-spinning binary black holes in 3+1 full general relativity addressing the effects of orbital eccentricity. We find that binary black holes with non-negligible eccentricity accrete matter with periodicity that matches the binary orbital period, whereas quasi-circular binaries exhibit accretion rate modulation at approximately $\sim 0.7\times$ their binary orbital period. Additionally, we find that the total jet luminosity is modulated at the orbital period for eccentric binaries, while quasi-circular binaries only exhibit long-term modulations. We perform a radiative transfer calculation of the dual jet synchrotron emission and demonstrate that the optically thin synchrotron emission varies on the binary orbital period for eccentric binaries. Moreover, eccentric binaries spend more time in a low state, where the synchrotron emission is minimum, than in a high state, where the synchrotron emission peaks. The quasi-circular binary also exhibits variability in its optically thin synchrotron emission but the exact frequency of variability does not appear robust against different parameters. Our suite of simulations is an essential step towards providing a comprehensive catalog of multi-messenger theoretical models that will enable studies of supermassive binary black holes detectable across the electromagnetic and gravitational wave spectra.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-\textbf{$c$} CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>gwharmone: first data-driven surrogate for eccentric harmonics in binary black hole merger waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present gwharmone, the first data-driven surrogate model for eccentric harmonics (as well as the full radiation content) of the dominant quadrupolar mode in eccentric, non-spinning binary black hole mergers. Our model is trained on 173 waveforms, each $100,000M$ long (where $M$ is the total mass), generated for mass ratios $q \in [1,3.5]$ and eccentricities $e_{\rm ref} \in [0,0.2]$ (at the start of the waveform). The eccentric harmonics are extracted from the effective-one-body waveforms using the \texttt{gwMiner} package. We apply a singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain a set of reduced basis vectors, necessary to construct a lower-dimensional representation of data, and use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to interpolate SVD coefficients across parameter space, allowing for prediction at new parameter points. The model includes the effect of mean anomaly, its evaluation cost is only $\sim 0.1$ second and it achieves an average time-domain (validation) error of ~0.001 and frequency-domain (validation) mismatches below 0.01 for advanced LIGO sensitivity. Our model can therefore be useful in efficient searches and parameter estimation of eccentric mergers. gwharmone will be publicly available through the gwModels package.</description>

      <title>Holographic phase transitions via thermally-assisted tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the thermal bounce solution in holographic models that describes first-order phase transitions between the deconfined and confined phases in strongly-coupled gauge theories. This new, periodic Euclidean solution represents transitions that occur via thermally-assisted tunneling and interpolates between the $O(4)$-symmetric vacuum bubble at zero temperature and the high temperature $O(3)$-symmetric critical bubble associated with classical thermal fluctuations. The exact thermal bounce solution can be used to obtain the bounce action at low temperatures which allows for a more accurate determination of vacuum decay rates, significantly improving previous estimates in holographic models. In particular, provided the phase transition is sufficiently supercooled, new predictions are obtained for the gravitational wave signal strength for critical temperatures ranging from the TeV scale up to $10^{12}$ GeV, some of which are within reach of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear evolution of matter overdensities using the spherical collapse model in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories beyond Horndeski, employing the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy approach. We investigate the impact of the EFT parameters characterising DHOST theories on the formation of large-scale structure. We identify the parameter space in which the collapse of the spherical overdensity is prevented by the scalar field turning imaginary at some moment, which allows us to place constraints on the model parameters. We show how the collapse time and the critical density contrast depend on the EFT parameters. To assess the observational implications, we compute the halo mass function using the Press-Schechter formalism. We find that the number density of halos is suppressed compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model due to ``beyond Horndeski'' effects, upon imposing the stability of linear perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the Kerr/CFT correspondence for magnetized black holes arising from Kaluza--Klein theory, demonstrating that Kerr/CFT holography persists beyond the traditional Einstein--Maxwell framework. Notably, unlike in the Einstein--Maxwell case, the massless neutral scalar field equation here is fully separable into radial and angular parts. This separability reveals a hidden conformal symmetry in the near--horizon, low--frequency regime, providing further support for the robustness of Kerr/CFT dualities in extended gravitational theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the statistical properties of noise is important in space-based gravitational wave data analysis. Traditional methods often assume uncorrelated noise or impose restrictive parametric forms on cross-channel correlations, which could lead to biased estimation in complex instrumental noise. This paper introduces a spline-based framework with trans-dimensional Bayesian inference to reconstruct the full noise covariance matrix, including frequency-dependent auto- and cross-power spectral densities, without prior assumptions on noise shapes. The developed software $\mathtt{NOISAR}$ can recover the features of the noise power spectrum curves with a relative error $\leq 10\%$ for both auto- and cross-one.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} &lt; 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: An important prediction of inflation is the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background. Observing this background is challenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of an astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. One possible way to distinguish between the two is to examine their anisotropies. In this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational wave anisotropies in the cosmological background generated by axion inflation, where the inflaton is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to gauge fields. In this scenario, tensor modes arise not only from the standard amplification of vacuum fluctuations present in any inflationary model, but also from the inverse decay process of the produced gauge fields. The correlator of gravitational wave anisotropies consists therefore of two main components: the contribution from vacuum tensor modes and the contribution from tensor modes sourced by the gauge fields. Our analysis shows that, while the former, previously studied in the literature, is negligible, the one arising from the sourced tensor modes, normalized by the fractional energy density at interferometer frequencies, can reach values as large as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This result shows that axion inflation can generate large anisotropies with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave detectors within a reasonable time frame.</description>

      <title>Greybody factor for an electrically charged regular-de Sitter black holes in $d$-dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of scalar fields in the gravitational background of higher-dimensional, electrically charged, regular de Sitter black holes. Using an approximate analytical approach, we derive expressions for the greybody factor for both minimally and non-minimally coupled scalar fields. In the low-energy regime, we find that the greybody factor remains non-zero for minimal coupling but vanishes for non-minimal coupling, indicating a significant influence of curvature coupling on the emission profile. Examining the greybody factor alongside the effective potential, we explore how particle parameters (the angular momentum number and the non-minimal coupling constant) and spacetime parameters (the dimension, the cosmological constant, and the non-linear charge parameter) affect particle emission. While non-minimal coupling and higher angular momentum modes generally suppress the greybody factor, the non-linear charge parameter enhances it. We then compute the Hawking radiation spectra for these black holes and observe that, despite the non-linear charge enhancing the greybody factor, both non-minimal coupling and the non-linear charge ultimately reduce the total energy emission rate. These results provide insights into how modifications to classical black hole solutions in higher dimensions, through the inclusion of non-linear electrodynamics, impact their quantum emission properties.</description>

      <title>Follow-up analyses of the binary-neutron-star signals GW170817 and GW190425 by using post-Newtonian waveform models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reanalyze the binary-neutron-star signals, GW170817 and GW190425, focusing on the inspiral regime to avoid uncertainties on waveform modeling in the postinspiral regime. We use post-Newtonian waveform models as templates, which are theoretically rigid and efficiently describe the inspiral regime. We study potential systematic difference in estimates of the binary tidal deformability $\tilde{\Lambda}$ by using different descriptions for the point-particle dynamics and tidal effects. We find that the estimates of $\tilde{\Lambda}$ show no significant systematic difference among three models for the point-particle parts: TF2, TF2g, and TF2+, when they employ the same tidal model. We compare different tidal descriptions given by different post-Newtonian orders in the tidal phase. Our results indicate that the estimates of $\tilde{\Lambda}$ slightly depend on the post-Newtonian order in the tidal phase and an increase in the tidal post-Newtonian order does not lead to a monotonic change in the estimate of $\tilde{\Lambda}$. We also compare the estimate of $\tilde{\Lambda}$ obtained by the post-Newtonian tidal model and numerical-relativity calibrated tidal models. We find that the post-Newtonian model gives slightly larger estimate of $\tilde{\Lambda}$ and wider posterior distribution than the numerical-relativity calibrated models. According to Bayesian model comparison, it is difficult to identify a preference among the post-Newtonian orders by relying on the GW170817 and GW190425 data. Our results indicate no preference among numerical-relativity calibrated tidal models over the post-Newtonian model. Additionally, we present constraints on equation-of-state models for neutron stars with the post-Newtonian model, which show that the GW170817 data disfavor less compact models, though they are slightly weaker constraints than the numerical-relativity calibrated tidal models.</description>

      <title>Multipole tidal effects in the post-Newtonian gravitational-wave phase of compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the multipole component form of the gravitational wave tidal phase for compact binary coalescences (MultipoleTidal), which consists of the mass quadrupole, the current quadrupole, and the mass octupole moments. We demonstrate the phase evolution and the phase difference between the tidal multipole moments (MultipoleTidal) and the mass quadrupole (PNTidal) as well as the numerical-relativity calibrated model (NRTidalv2). We find the MultipoleTidal gives a larger phase shift than the PNTidal, and is closer to the NRTidalv2. We compute the matches between waveform models to see the impact of the tidal multipole moments on the gravitational wave phases. We find the MultipoleTidal gives larger matches to the NRTidalv2 than the PNTidal, in particular, for high masses and large tidal deformabilities. We also apply the MultipoleTidal model to binary neutron star coalescence events GW170817 and GW190425. We find that the current quadrupole and the mass octupole moments give no significant impact on the inferred tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>Flattened bispectrum of the scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array collaborations have reported evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background. The gravitational waves induced by primordial curvature perturbations, referred to as scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), could potentially be the physical origins of the gravitational wave background. Due to nonlinearity of Einstein's gravity, there is non-Gaussianity of SIGWs even when the sourced primordial curvature perturbation is Gaussian. This paper investigates the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of SIGWs influenced by formation of primordial black holes. Specifically, we examine whether spectral width of Gaussian primordial curvature perturbations can affect non-Gaussianity of SIGWs. In order to ensure us to correctly quantify the degree of non-Gaussianity, we introduce an oscillation average scheme that can conserve the exact results of skewness of SIGWs. In this framework, the oscillation of SIGWs not only suppresses the bispectrum amplitude but also leads to a flattened-type bispectrum. Based on our results of skewness, it is found that the primordial curvature power spectrum with a narrower width can enhance the intrinsic non-Gaussianity.</description>

Abstract: We examine the vacuum state and its corresponding renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) in static horizonless regular spacetime in both two and four dimensions. Using the local field formulation of the anomaly-induced effective action, we show that the regularities of the spacetime and the RSET dictate the appropriate vacuum state. Furthermore, through a case study under the horizonless Bardeen-type spacetime, we demonstrate that the preferred vacuum state is not the Boulware vacuum, but a nontrivial one with a different RSET profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser interferometers has opened a new window to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the strong, dynamical, and non-linear regime. In this paper, we follow an agnostic approach and we study the quasi-normal modes of gravitational perturbations of Johannsen black holes under the assumptions of the validity of the Einstein Equations and of low values of the black hole spin parameter and deformation parameters. We find that the deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ has a stronger impact on the quasi-normal modes than the other leading order deformation parameters ($\alpha_{22}$, $\alpha_{52}$, and $\epsilon_{3}$). We derive a fitting formula for the fundamental modes with $l=2$ and $l=3$ for the deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ valid in the slow rotation approximation ($a_* &lt; 0.4$). Finally, we constrain $\alpha_{13}$ from the event GW170104; within our analysis, we find that the data of GW170104 are consistent with the predictions of GR.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the different steps to include the adiabatic tidal effects to the gravitational waveform amplitude for quasi-circular non-spinning compact binaries up to the second-and-a-half post-Newtonian (PN) order. The amplitude, that relates the two gravitational wave polarizations, is decomposed onto the basis of spin-weighted spherical harmonics of spin -2, parametrized by the two numbers $(\ell,m)$, where the modes of the waveform correspond to the coefficients of the decomposition. These modes are readily computed from the radiative multipole moments. They can be expressed in a PN-expanded form as well as in a factorized form, suitable to be directly included in effective-one-body models to describe more accurately the waveform of binary neutron stars. We also provide the energy flux and phasing evolution in time and frequency domain. The results presented in this article are collected in an ancillary file.</description>

      <title>Constraining the curvature-induced quantum gravity scales via gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters that govern curvature-induced quantum gravity time-of-flight (TOF) effects. These TOF delays, which occur due to modified dispersion relations of particles in the vacuum, could be a phenomenological signature of quantum gravity. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), short, high-energy events from distant galaxies, offer a unique opportunity to impose observational limits on TOF delays and, by extension, on the energy scales of quantum gravity. Using the standard Jacob-Piran relation, which assumes a locally-flat spacetime, the analysis of quantum gravity-induced TOF effects establishes a lower limit of approximately $10 E_{\rm Pl}$ on the energy scale of these effects. However, curvature-induced quantum gravity effects may introduce additional contributions. From current GRB observations, we find that, at a 95% credibility level, in the symmetry-deformed scenario, curvature-induced TOF effects may only arise at energies above $0.04 E_{\rm Pl}$. If we consider only curvature-induced effects, this limit is an order of magnitude stronger. Observing more GRBs at different redshifts could improve the constraints on the curvature-induced QG phenomena. However, given the capabilities of current telescopes and the current understanding of GRBs, it is unlikely that these constraints will be significantly extended beyond the present level.</description>

The derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking is approximated by the hyperbolic scarf potential, which allows for an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev about certain ``magical" amplitudes of the potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the motion of charged particles around the weakly magnetized Schwarzschild-like bumblebee black hole which has Lorentz symmetry breaking. Charged particles have curled orbits around the black hole which can only appear in the presence of external magnetic field. We investigate the effect of Lorentz violation factor on the curled orbit for both the case with and without cosmological constant. Furthermore, we investigate the harmonic oscillation behavior of the charged particles around the stable circular orbit. By using the epicyclic resonance model, we relate the harmonic oscillations of charged particles to the twin high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in micro-quasars. Based on the observations of quasi-periodic oscillation, we provide a stringent constraint on the Lorentz violating parameters by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. As the black hole shadow for Schwarzschild-like bumblebee black hole degenerates to the ordinary Schwarzschild black hole, the constraints we obtained from the quasi-period oscillation is crucial for further searching for the imprint of Lorentz symmetry breaking in our universe.</description>

Abstract: Spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of a combination of powers of 1/r and ln r are known as polyhomogeneous spacetimes. The asymptotic behaviour of the Newman-Penrose quantities for these spacetimes is presented under certain gauges. The Bondi mass is revisited via the Iyer-Wald formalism. The memory effect of the gravitational radiation in the polyhomogeneous spacetimes is also discussed. It is found that the appearance of the logarithmic terms does not affect the balance law and it remains unchanged as the one of spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of powers of 1/r.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.08934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pose and resolve a holographic puzzle regarding an apparent violation of causality in AdS/CFT. If a point in the bulk of $AdS$ moves at the speed of light, the boundary subregion that encodes it may need to move superluminally to keep up. With $AdS_3$ as our main example, we prove that the finite extent of the encoding regions prevents a paradox. We show that the length of the minimal-size encoding interval gives rise to a tortoise coordinate on $\mathrm{AdS}$ that measures the nonlocality of the encoding. We use this coordinate to explore circular and radial motion in the bulk before passing to the analysis of bulk null geodesics. For these null geodesics, there is always a critical encoding where the possible violation of causality is barely avoided. We show that in any other encoding, the possible violation is subcritical.</description>

      <title>New brane-like solutions in modified four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09503v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate solutions of a new $4D$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity ($4D$ $EGB$). We first describe the bulk vacuum solution, then we add a massive probe scalar field, and we follow considering a self-interacting scalar field which acts as a source to support thick brane solutions in the four-dimensional $EGB$ scenario with a single extra dimension of infinite extent. We illustrate our results with some distinct brane-like configurations engendering controllable thickness. It is noteworthy that such configurations are simultaneous solutions in both versions of the modified theory of gravity, the original Glavan and Lin formulation and the regularized $4D$ $EGB$.</description>

      <title>Infinite Temperature is Not So Infinite: The Many Temperatures of de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several distinct concepts of temperature appear in the holographic description of de Sitter space. Conflating these has led to confusion and inconsistent claims. The double-scaled limit of SYK is a concrete model in which we can examine and explain these different concepts of temperature. This note began as an addendum to our paper ``Comments on a Paper by Narovlansky and Verlinde" but in the process of writing it we learned new things -- interesting in their own right -- that we wish to report here.</description>

      <title>T-Minkowski noncommutative spacetimes II: classical field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that develops the mathematical framework necessary for studying field theories on ``T-Minkowski'' noncommutative spacetimes. These spacetimes constitute a class of noncommutative geometries, introduced in Part I, that are each invariant under distinct quantum group deformations of the Poincar\'e group. All these noncommutative geometries possess certain physically desirable characteristics, which allow me to develop all the tools of differential geometry and functional analysis, that are necessary in order to build consistent and T-Poincar\'e invariant noncommutative classical field theories.</description>

      <title>Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries near Neutron Star Disruption Limit in the Mass Regime of Event GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In May 2023, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected the likely black hole-neutron star (BHNS) merger GW230529_181500. That event is expected to be the merger of a 2.5-4.5 $M_{\odot}$ primary with a secondary compact object of mass between 1.2-2.0 $M_{\odot}$. This makes it the first BHNS merger with a significant potential for the production of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the suspected lower mass gap. To produce post-merger EM transients, the component of the black hole spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum must be sufficiently high, allowing the neutron star to be tidally disrupted. The disrupting BHNS binary may then eject a few percent of a solar mass of matter, leading to an observable kilonova driven by radioactive decays in ejecta, and/or a compact-binary GRB (cbGRB) resulting from the formation of an accretion disk and relativistic jet. Determining which mergers lead to disruption of the neutron star is necessary to predict the prevalence of EM signals from BHNS mergers, yet most BHNS simulations so far have been performed far from the minimum spin required for tidal disruption. Here, we use the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) to explore the behavior of BHNS mergers in a mass range consistent with GW230529_181500 close to that critical spin, and compare our results against the mass remnant model currently used by the LVK collaboration to predict the probability of tidal disruption. Our numerical results reveal the emergence of non-zero accretion disks even below the predicted NS disruption limit, of low mass but capable of powering cbGRBs. Our results also demonstrate that the remnant mass model underpredicts the disk mass for the DD2 EOS, while they are within expected modeling errors for SFHo. In all of our simulations, any kilonova signal would be dim and dominated by post-merger disk outflows.</description>

      <title>$p$-Chords, Wee-Chords, and de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of us (L.S.) and H. Verlinde independently conjectured a holographic duality between the double-scaled SYK model at infinite temperature and dimensionally reduced $(2+1)$-dimensional de Sitter space [1]-[8]. Beyond the statement that such a duality exists there was deep disagreement between the two proposals [9]. In this note, we trace the origin of the disagreement to a superficial similarity between two q-deformed algebraic structures: the algebra of "chords" in DSSYK, and the algebra of line operators in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D de Sitter gravity. Assuming that these two structures are the same requires an identification of parameters [7][10] which leads to a collapse of the separation of scales [9] -- the separation being required by the semiclassical limit [3][9]. Dropping that assumption restores the separation of scales but leaves unexplained the relation between chords and Chern-Simons line operators. In this note we point out the existence of a third q-deformed algebra that appears in DSSYK: the algebra of ``wee-chords." Identifying the Chern-Simons line operators with wee-chords removes the discrepancy and leads to a satisfying relation between the two sides of the duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity computations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. However, the one loop gravity correction contains a dimension dependent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$, which seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including an observer, this phase gets mostly cancelled for the quantity that should correspond to a count of states. However, an overall minus sign remains.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Conformal $BMS_3$ Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An enhanced version of the conformal BMS$_{3}$ algebra is presented. It is shown to emerge from the asymptotic structure of an extension of conformal gravity in 3D by Pope and Townsend that consistently accommodates an additional spin-2 field, once it is endowed with a suitable set of boundary conditions. The canonical generators of the asymptotic symmetries then span a precise nonlinear W$_{(2,2,2,2,1,1,1)}$ algebra, whose central extensions and coefficients of the nonlinear terms are completely determined by the central charge of the Virasoro subalgebra. The wedge algebra corresponds to the conformal group in four dimensions $SO(4,2)$ and therefore, enhanced conformal BMS$_{3}$ can also be regarded as an infinite-dimensional nonlinear extension of the AdS$_{5}$ algebra with nontrivial central extensions. It is worth mentioning that our boundary conditions might be considered as a starting point in order to consistently incorporate either a finite or an infinite number of conformal higher spin fields.</description>

      <title>The spinning self-force EFT: 1SF waveform recursion relation and Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on recent approaches, we develop an effective field theory for the interaction of spinning particles modeling Kerr black holes within the gravitational self-force expansion. To incorporate dimensional regularization into this framework, we analyze the Myers-Perry black hole and its particle description, obtaining a novel form of the corresponding linearized stress tensor. We then derive the 1SF self-force effective action up to quadratic order in the spin expansion, identifying a new type of spinning recoil term that arises from integrating out the heavy dynamics. Next, we study the 1SF metric perturbation both from the traditional self-force perspective and through the diagrammatic background field expansion, making contact with the radiative waveform. This leads us to consider a novel recursion relation for the curved space 1SF Compton amplitude, which we study up to one-loop in the wave regime and compare with the flat space one-loop Compton amplitude for Kerr up to quadratic order in spin. Finally, we investigate the 1SF spinning Compton amplitude in the eikonal regime, clarifying how strong-field effects -- such as the location of the separatrix -- emerge from the resummation of the perturbative weak-field expansion.</description>
