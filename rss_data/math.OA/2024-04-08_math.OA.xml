      <title>On the extension of positive maps to Haagerup non-commutative $L^p$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra, let $\varphi$ be a normal faithful state on $M$ and let $L^p(M,\varphi)$ be the associated Haagerup non-commutative $L^p$-spaces, for $1\leq p\leq\infty$. Let $D\in L^1(M,\varphi)$ be the density of $\varphi$. Given a positive map $T\colon M\to M$ such that $\varphi\circ T\leq C_1\varphi$ for some $C_1\geq 0$, we study the boundedness of the $L^p$-extension $T_{p,\theta}\colon D^{\frac{1-\theta}{p}} M D^{\frac{\theta}{p}}\to L^p(M,\varphi)$ which maps $D^{\frac{1-\theta}{p}} x D^{\frac{\theta}{p}}$ to $D^{\frac{1-\theta}{p}} T(x) D^{\frac{\theta}{p}}$ for all $x\in M$. Haagerup-Junge-Xu showed that $T_{p,\frac12}$ is always bounded and left open the question whether $T_{p,\theta}$ is bounded for $\theta\not=\frac12$. We show that for any $1\leq p&lt;2$ and any $\theta\in [0,2^{-1}(1-\sqrt{p-1})]\cup[2^{-1}(1+\sqrt{p-1}), 1]$, there exists a completely positive $T$ such that $T_{p,\theta}$ is unbounded. We also show that if $T$ is $2$-positive, then $T_{p,\theta}$ is bounded provided that $p\geq 2$ or $1\leq p&lt;2$ and $\theta\in[1-p/2,p/2]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study surjective maps between the sets of all self-adjoint elements of unital $C^*$-algebras which satisfy the multiplicatively spectrum-preserving property. We show that such maps are characterized by Jordan isomorphisms and central symmetries. This is an answer to a problem posed by Moln\'ar.</description>

      <title>Null projections and noncommutative function theory in operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study projections in the bidual of a $C^*$-algebra $B$ that are null with respect to a subalgebra $A$, that is projections $p\in B^{**}$ satisfying $|\phi|(p)=0$ for every $\phi\in B^*$ annihilating $A$. In the separable case, $A$-null projections are precisely the peak projections in the bidual of $A$ at which the subalgebra $A$ interpolates the entire $C^*$-algebra $B$. These are analogues of null sets in classical function theory, on which several profound results rely. This motivates the development of a noncommutative variant, which we use to find appropriate `quantized' versions of some of these classical facts. Through a delicate generalization of a theorem of Varopoulos, we show that, roughly speaking, sufficiently regular interpolation projections are null precisely when their atomic parts are. As an application, we give alternative proofs and sharpenings of some recent peak-interpolation results of Davidson and Hartz for algebras on Hilbert function spaces, also illuminating thereby how earlier noncommutative peak-interpolation theory may be applied. In another direction, given a convex subset of the state space of $B$, we characterize when the associated Riesz projection is null. This is then applied to various important topics in noncommutative function theory, such as the F.&amp; M. Riesz property, the existence of Lebesgue decompositions, the description of Henkin functionals, and Arveson's noncommutative Hardy spaces (maximal subdiagonal algebras).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture predicts that if the non-commutative Choquet boundary of a separable operator system $\mathcal{S}$ is the entire spectrum of its generated C*-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ then $\mathcal{S}$ is hyperrigid in $\mathcal{B}$. We provide a counterexample to the conjecture with a C*-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ of type I generated by a single operator.</description>

      <title>Foundations for operator algebraic tricategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An operator algebraic tricategory is a higher categorical analogue of an operator algebra. For algebraic tricategories, Gordon, Power, and Street proved that every algebraic tricategory is equivalent to a Gray-category, a result later refined by Gurski. We adapt this result to the context of functional analysis, showing that every operator algebraic tricategory is equivalent to an operator Gray-category. We then categorify the Gelfand-Naimark theorem for operator algebras, inductively proving that every (small) operator algebraic tricategory is equivalent to a concrete operator Gray-category. We also provide several examples of interest for operator algebraic tricategories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel construction of quantized universal enveloping $*$-algebras of real semisimple Lie algebras, based on Letzter's theory of quantum symmetric pairs. We show that these structures can be `integrated', leading to a quantization of the group C$^*$-algebra of an arbitrary semisimple algebraic real Lie group.</description>

      <title>Free Extreme points of free spectrahedrops and generalized free spectrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix convexity generalizes convexity to the dimension free setting and has connections to many mathematical and applied pursuits including operator theory, quantum information, noncommutative optimization, and linear control systems. In the setting of classical convex sets, extreme points are central objects which exhibit many important properties. For example, the Minkowski theorem shows that any element of a closed bounded convex set can be expressed as a convex combination of extreme points. Extreme points are also of great interest in the dimension free setting of matrix convex sets; however, here the situation requires more nuance.
  In the dimension free setting, there are many different types of extreme points. Of particular importance are free extreme points, a highly restricted type of extreme point that is closely connected to the dilation theoretic Arveson boundary. If free extreme points span a matrix convex set through matrix convex combinations, then they satisfy a strong notion of minimality in doing so. However, not all closed bounded matrix convex sets even have free extreme points. Thus, a major goal is to determine which matrix convex sets are spanned by their free extreme points.
  Building on a recent work of J. W. Helton and the author which shows that free spectrahedra, i.e., dimension free solution sets to linear matrix inequalities, are spanned by their free extreme points, we establish two additional classes of matrix convex sets which are the matrix convex hull of their free extreme points. Namely, we show that closed bounded free spectrahedrops, i.e, closed bounded projections of free spectrahedra, are the span of their free extreme points. Furthermore, we show that if one considers linear operator inequalities that have compact operator defining tuples, then the resulting ``generalized" free spectrahedra are spanned by their free extreme points.</description>

      <title>Irreducible representations of the crystallisation of the $C^{*}$-algebra $C(SU_{q}(n+1))$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystallization of the $C^*$-algebras $C(SU_{q}(n+1))$ was introduced by Giri \&amp; Pal in arXiv:2203.14665 [math.QA] as a $C^*$-algebra $A_{n}(0)$ given by a finite set of generators and relations. Here we study the irreducible representations of the $C^*$-algebra $A_{n}(0)$ and prove a factorization theorem for its irreducible representations. This leads to a complete classification of all irreducible representations of $A_{n}(0)$. As an important consequence, we prove that all the irreducible representations arise exactly as $q\to 0+$ limits of the irreducible representations of $C (SU_{q}(n+1))$ given by a result of Soibelman. As a consequence, we show that $A_{n}(0)$ is a type I $C^{*}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>On relative commutants of subalgebras in group and tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group acting on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Given $x\in X$, and $\mu\in\text{Prob}(X)$, we introduce the notion of contraction of $\mu$ towards $x$ with respect to unitary elements of a group von Neumann algebra not necessarily coming from group elements. Using this notion, we study relative commutants of subalgebras in tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras. The results are applied to negatively curved groups and $\text{SL}(d,\mathbb{Z})$, $d \geq 2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A commuting tuple of Hilbert space operators $(T_1, \dotsc, T_n)$ is said to be an \textit{$\mathbb{A}_r^n$-contraction} if the closure of the polyannulus
  \[
  \mathbb A_r^n=\left\{(z_1, \dotsc, z_n) \ : \ r&lt;|z_i|&lt;1, \ 1 \leq i \leq n \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n \qquad \quad (0&lt;r&lt;1)
  \]
  is a spectral set for $(T_1, \dotsc, T_n)$. We find characterizations for the $\mathbb A_r^n$-unitaries and $\mathbb A_r^n$-isometries and decipher their structures. We find Wold type decompositions for any number of commuting and doubly commuting $\mathbb A_r$-isometries. Then we generalize these results to any family of commuting and doubly commuting $\mathbb A_r$-contractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sabidussi's theorem [Duke Math. J. 28, 1961] gives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the automorphism group of a lexicographic product of two graphs is a wreath product of the respective automorphism groups. We prove a quantum version of Sabidussi's theorem for finite graphs, with the automorphism groups replaced by quantum automorphism groups and the wreath product replaced by the free wreath product of quantum groups. This extends the result of Chassaniol [J. Algebra 456, 2016], who proved it for regular graphs. Moreover, we apply our result to lexicographic products of quantum vertex transitive graphs, determining their quantum automorphism groups even when Sabidussi's conditions do not apply.</description>
