      <title>Orientation of Entrance and Burial Chamber in the Pyramids of the Egyptian Fourth and Fifth Dynasties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22682v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, arxiv:2412.20407, we have mentioned two Egyptian kings, Shepseskaf and Userkaf, of the IV and V Dynasties. Here we continue discussing their burial places, that is their pyramids, in a new framework based on the study of orientation of pyramid substructures (entrances, corridors, burial chambers). Shepseskaf and Userkaf opted for the same architectonic solutions, exhibiting a continuity in funerary architecture. After showing the substructure orientations of the pyramids of the IV and V Dynasties, we will stress that the substructure in the Shepseskaf's pyramid, the Mastabat Fara'un, is oriented as in the Fourth Dynasty architecture of pyramids and that it has a layout which is closer to that used by the following Fifth Dynasty. In our discussion, we will start with the first ruler of the Fourth Dynasty, Snefru, who introduced a new form of external and internal layout of the burial complexes of the king, through an evolution based on four attempts, the Seila, Meidum, Bent and Red pyramids. In the final model, the Snefru's Red pyramid, the substructure has a north entrance and a burial chamber east-west oriented. This orientation persisted in the pyramids of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties, and beyond. The Sekhemkhet (Djoserty) pyramid of the Third Dynasty is also illustrated for comparison, such as some earlier burial monuments. In the discussion here proposed the position of sarcophagus and of the body inside it is also investigated. The sarcophagus has its axis north-south. The body of the deceased king was lying on its left side, extended, head to the north, face towards the east. In this framework, we propose again what we told in arXiv 2016, arxiv:1604.05963, and the layout of pyramids with respect to sunrise on solstices.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained entropy balance of the Szilard engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to reconcile the entropy reduction of a system through external interventions that are linked to a measurement with the second law of thermodynamics, there are two main proposals: (i) The entropy reduction is compensated by the entropy increase as a result of the measurement on the system (``Szilard principle"). (ii) The entropy reduction is compensated by the entropy increase as a result of the erasure of the measurement results (``Landauer/Bennett principle"). It seems that the LB principle is widely accepted in the scientific debate. In contrast, in this paper we argue for a modified S principle and criticize the LB principle with regard to various points. Our approach is based on the concept of ``conditional action", which is developed in detail. To illustrate our theses, we consider the entropy balance of a variant of the well-known Szilard engine, understood as a classical mechanical system.</description>

      <title>Astronomers Getting Less Creative Over Time Is Why This Title Isn't Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For generations, people have complained that things used to be better in the past. In this paper, we investigate this change by specifically looking at creativity in astronomy. To do this,we explore if older constellations reflected a greater sense of creativity on the part of those designing them than more modern constellations do. We find that things really have become simplistic and less original over time.</description>

      <title>Which features of quantum physics are not fundamentally quantum but are due to indeterminism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is fundamentally quantum? We argue that most of the features, problems, and paradoxes -- such as the measurement problem, the Wigner's friend paradox and its proposed solutions, single particle nonlocality, and no-cloning -- allegedly attributed to quantum physics have a classical analogue if one is to interpret classical physics as fundamentally indeterministic. What really characterizes non-classical effects are incompatible physical quantities, which, in quantum quantum theory are associated to the fundamental constant $\hbar$.</description>
