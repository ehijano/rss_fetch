      <title>The Unreasonable Efficacy of the Lifting Condition in Higher Categorical Galois Theory I: a Quasi-categorical Galois Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In (Borceux-Janelidze 2001) they prove a Categorical Galois Theorem for ordinary categories, and establish the main result of (Joyal-Tierney 1984), along with the classical Galois theory of Rings, as instances of this more general result. The main result of the present work refines this to a Quasicategorical Galois Theorem, by drawing heavily on the foundation laid in (Lurie 2024). More importantly, the argument used to prove the result is intended to highlight a deep connection between factorization systems (specifically the lex modalities of (Anel-Biedermann-Finster-Joyal 2021)), higher-categorical Galois Theorems, and Galois theories internal to higher toposes. This is the first part in a series of works, intended merely to motivate the lens and prove Theorem 3.4. In future work, we will delve into a generalization of the argument, and offer tools for producing applications.</description>

      <title>Convex decomposition spaces and Crapo complementation formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Crapo complementation formula for the M\"obius function $\mu^X$ in a general decomposition space $X$ in terms of a convex subspace $K$ and its complement: $\mu^X \simeq \mu^{X\setminus K} + \mu^X*\zeta^K*\mu^X$. We work at the objective level, meaning that the formula is an explicit homotopy equivalence of $\infty$-groupoids. Almost all arguments are formulated in terms of (homotopy) pullbacks. Under suitable finiteness conditions on $X$, one can take homotopy cardinality to obtain a formula in the incidence algebra at the level of $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras. When $X$ is the nerve of a locally finite poset, this recovers the Bj\"orner--Walker formula, which in turn specialises to the original Crapo complementation formula when the poset is a finite lattice. A substantial part of the work is to introduce and develop the notion of convexity for decomposition spaces, which in turn requires some general preparation in decomposition-space theory, notably some results on reduced covers and ikeo and semi-ikeo maps. These results may be of wider interest. Once this is set up, the objective proof of the Crapo formula is quite similar to that of Bj\"orner--Walker.</description>

      <title>Nerves of enriched categories via necklaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce necklicial nerve functors from enriched categories to simplicial sets, which include Cordier's homotopy coherent, Lurie's differential graded and Le Grignou's cubical nerves. It is shown that every necklicial nerve can be lifted to the templicial objects of arXiv:2302.02484v2. Building on the work of Dugger and Spivak, we give sufficient conditions under which the left-adjoint of a necklicial nerve can be described more explicitly. As an application, we obtain novel and simple expressions for the left-adjoints of the dg-nerve and cubical nerve.</description>

      <title>A K-theory spectrum for cobordism cut and paste groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cobordism groups and cut-and-paste groups of manifolds arise from imposing two different relations on the monoid of manifolds under disjoint union. By imposing both relations simultaneously, a cobordism cut and paste group $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}_n$ is defined. In this paper, we extend this definition to manifolds with boundary obtaining $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$ and study the relationship of this group to an appropriately defined cobordism group of manifolds with boundary. The main results are the construction of a spectrum that recovers on $\pi_0$ the cobordism cut and paste groups of manifolds with boundary, $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$, and a map of spectra that lifts the canonical quotient map $\mathrm{SK}^{\partial}_n \rightarrow \overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$.</description>
