      <title>Symbol Distributions in Semantic Communications: A Source-Channel Equilibrium Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication systems often use an end-to-end neural network to map input data into continuous symbols. These symbols, which are essentially neural network features, usually have fixed dimensions and heavy-tailed distributions. However, due to the end-to-end training nature of the neural network encoder, the underlying reason for the symbol distribution remains underexplored. We propose a new explanation for the semantic symbol distribution: an inherent trade-off between source coding and communications. Specifically, the encoder balances two objectives: allocating power for minimum \emph{effective codelength} (for source coding) and maximizing mutual information (for communications). We formalize this trade-off via an information-theoretic optimization framework, which yields a Student's $t$-distribution as the resulting symbol distribution. Through extensive studies on image-based semantic systems, we find that our formulation models the learned symbols and predicts how the symbol distribution's shape parameter changes with respect to (i) the use of variable-length coding and (ii) the dataset's entropy variability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how introducing a regularizer that enforces a target symbol distribution, which guides the encoder towards a target prior (e.g., Gaussian), improves training convergence and supports our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Complete weight enumerators and weight hierarchies for linear codes from quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for an odd prime power $q$, we extend the construction of Xie et al. \cite{XOYM2023} to propose two classes of linear codes $\mathcal{C}_{Q}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q}'$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with at most four nonzero weights. These codes are derived from quadratic forms through a bivariate construction. We completely determine their complete weight enumerators and weight hierarchies by employing exponential sums. Most of these codes are minimal and some are optimal in the sense that they meet the Griesmer bound. Furthermore, we also establish the weight hierarchies of $\mathcal{C}_{Q,N}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q,N}'$, which are the descended codes of $\mathcal{C}_{Q}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q}'$.</description>

      <title>Target Detection in Clustered Mobile Nanomachine Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the development of an analytical framework to study a diffusion-assisted molecular communication-based network of nano-machines (NMs) with a clustered initial deployment to detect a target in a three-dimensional (3D) medium. Leveraging the Poisson cluster process to model the initial locations of clustered NMs, we derive the analytical expression for the target detection probability with respect to time along with relevant bounds. We also investigate a single-cluster scenario. All the derived expressions are validated through extensive particle-based simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key parameters, such as the mean number of NMs per cluster, the density of the cluster, and the spatial spread, on the detection performance. Our results show that detection probability is greatly influenced by clustering, and different spatial arrangements produce varying performances. The results offer a better understanding of how molecular communication systems should be designed for optimal target detection in nanoscale and biological environments.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Unknown Channel Statistics: A Hybrid Offline-Online Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust beamforming design under imperfect channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, particularly when the channel estimation error statistics are unknown. Conventional model-driven methods usually rely on prior knowledge of the error covariance matrix and data-driven deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization capability to unseen channel conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid offline-online framework that achieves effective offline learning and rapid online adaptation. In the offline phase, we propose a shared (among users) deep neural network (DNN) that is able to learn the channel estimation error covariance from observed samples, thus enabling robust beamforming without statistical priors. Meanwhile, to facilitate real-time deployment, we propose a sparse augmented low-rank (SALR) method to reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance. In the online phase, we show that the proposed network can be rapidly fine-tuned with minimal gradient steps. Furthermore, a multiple basis model-agnostic meta-learning (MB-MAML) strategy is further proposed to maintain multiple meta-initializations and by dynamically selecting the best one online, we can improve the adaptation and generalization capability of the proposed framework under unseen or non-stationary channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline-online framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse channel conditions and it is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.</description>

      <title>Agile Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement to 6G calls for waveforms that transcend static robustness to achieve intelligent adaptability. Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), despite its strength in doubly-dispersive channels, has been confined by chirp parameters optimized for worst-case scenarios. This paper shatters this limitation with Agile-AFDM, a novel framework that endows AFDM with dynamic, data-aware intelligence. By redefining chirp parameters as optimizable variables for each transmission block based on real-time channel and data information, Agile-AFDM transforms into an adaptive platform. It can actively reconfigure its waveform to minimize peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for power efficiency, suppress inter-carrier interference (ICI) for communication reliability, or reduce Cramer-Rao bound (CRLB) for sensing accuracy. This paradigm shift from a static, one-size-fits-all waveform to a context-aware signal designer is made practical by efficient, tailored optimization algorithms. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that this capability delivers significant performance gains across all metrics, surpassing conventional OFDM and static AFDM. Agile-AFDM, therefore, offers a crucial step forward in the design of agile waveforms for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Performance of Compression-Based Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a denoiser that reconstructs a stationary ergodic source by lossily compressing samples of the source observed through a memoryless noisy channel. Prior work on compression-based denoising has been limited to additive noise channels. We extend this framework to general discrete memoryless channels by deliberately choosing the distortion measure for the lossy compressor to match the channel conditional distribution. By bounding the deviation of the empirical joint distribution of the source, observation, and denoiser outputs from satisfying a Markov property, we give an exact characterization of the loss achieved by such a denoiser. Consequences of these results are explicitly demonstrated in special cases, including for MSE and Hamming loss. A comparison is made to an indirect rate-distortion perspective on the problem.</description>

      <title>Shakespeare, Entropy and Educated Monkeys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has often been said, correctly, that a monkey forever randomly typing on a keyboard would eventually produce the complete works of William Shakespeare. Almost just as often it has been pointed out that this "eventually" is well beyond any conceivably relevant time frame. We point out that an educated monkey that still types at random but is constrained to only write "statistically typical" text, would produce any given passage in a much shorter time. Information theory gives a very simple way to estimate that time. For example, Shakespeare's phrase, Better three hours too soon than a minute too late, from The Merry Wives of Windsor, would take the educated monkey only 73 thousand years to produce, compared to the beyond-astronomical $2.7 \times 10^{63}$ years for the randomly typing one. Despite the obvious improvement, it would still take the educated monkey an unimaginably long $10^{42,277}$ years to produce all of Hamlet.</description>

      <title>Blind Radio Mapping via Spatially Regularized Bayesian Trajectory Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio maps enable intelligent wireless applications by capturing the spatial distribution of channel characteristics. However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a symplectic framework for quantum error correcting codes in which local structure is analyzed through an anticode perspective. In this setting, a code is treated as a symplectic space, and anticodes arise as maximal symplectic subspaces whose elements vanish on a prescribed set of components, providing a natural quantum analogue of their classical counterparts. This framework encompasses several families of quantum codes, including stabilizer and subsystem codes, provides a natural extension of generalized distances in quantum codes, and yields new invariants that capture local algebraic and combinatorial features. The notion of anticodes also naturally leads to operations such as puncturing and shortening for symplectic codes, which in turn provide algebraic interpretations of key phenomena in quantum error correction, such as the cleaning lemma and complementary recovery and yield new descriptions of weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>Cluster expansion of the log-likelihood ratio: Optimal detection of planted matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand how hidden information can be extracted from statistical networks, planted models in random graphs have been the focus of intensive study in recent years. In this work, we consider the detection of a planted matching, i.e., an independent edge set, hidden in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, which is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem. We identify the critical regime for this testing problem and prove that the log-likelihood ratio is asymptotically normal. Via analyses of computationally efficient edge or wedge count test statistics that attain the optimal limits of detection, our results also reveal the absence of a statistical-to-computational gap. Our main technical tool is the cluster expansion from statistical physics, which allows us to prove a precise, non-asymptotic characterization of the log-likelihood ratio. Our analyses rely on a careful reorganization and cancellation of terms that occur in the difference between monomer-dimer log partition functions on the complete and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. This combinatorial and statistical physics approach represents a significant departure from the more established methods such as orthogonal decompositions, and positions the cluster expansion as a viable technique in the study of log-likelihood ratios for planted models in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive connectivity with ultra-low latency and high reliability necessitates fundamental advances in future communication networks operating under finite-blocklength (FBL) transmission. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged as a promising enabler, offering superior spectrum and energy efficiency in short-packet/FBL scenarios. In this work, by leveraging the simplicity and accuracy of block-correlation channel modeling, we rigorously bound the performance limits of FBL-FAS from a statistical perspective, focusing on two key performance metrics: block error rate (BLER) and outage probability (OP). Furthermore, we introduce a novel complex-integral simplification method based on Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, which achieves higher approximation accuracy compared to existing Taylor-expansion-based approaches. Numerical results validate the robustness of the proposed analysis and clearly demonstrate the superiority of FBL-FAS over conventional multiple-antenna systems with fixed antenna placement.</description>

Abstract: Binary self-dual sequences have been considered and analyzed throughout the years, and they have been used for various applications. Motivated by a construction for single-track Gray codes, we examine the structure and recursive constructions for binary and non-binary self-dual sequences. The feedback shift registers that generate such sequences are discussed. The connections between these sequences and maximum period single-track codes are discussed. Maximum period non-binary single-track Gray codes of length $p^t$ and period $p^{p^t}$ are constructed. These are the first infinite families of maximum period codes presented in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the enumerative and asymptotic properties related to Hermitian $\ell$-complementary codes on the unitary space over $\F_{q^2}$. We provide some closed form expressions for the counting formulas of Hermitian $\ell$-complementary codes. There is a similarity in the asymptotic weight distribution between Hermitian self-orthogonal codes and unrestricted codes. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of Hermitian self-orthogonal codes whose minimum distance is at least $d$. In particular, we conclude that MDS codes within the class of Hermitian self-orthogonal codes are asymptotically dense when the alphabet size approaches to infinity.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for calculating the quantum relative entropy of channels, an essential quantity in quantum channel discrimination and resource theories of quantum channels. By building on recent developments in the optimization of relative entropy for quantum states [Ko{\ss}mann and Schwonnek, arXiv:2404.17016], we introduce a discretized linearization of the integral representation for the relative entropy of states, enabling us to handle maximization tasks for the relative entropy of channels. Our approach here extends previous work on minimizing relative entropy to the more complicated domain of maximization. It also provides efficiently computable upper and lower bounds that sandwich the true value with any desired precision, leading to a practical method for computing the relative entropy of channels.</description>

      <title>Error-correcting codes and absolutely maximally entangled states for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major difficulty in quantum computation is the ability to implement fault tolerant computations, protecting information against undesired interactions with the environment. Stabiliser codes were introduced as a means to protect information when storing or applying computations in Hilbert spaces where the local dimension is fixed, i.e. in Hilbert spaces of the form $({\mathbb C}^D)^{\otimes n}$. If $D$ is a prime power then one can consider stabiliser codes over finite fields \cite{KKKS2006}, which allows a deeper mathematical structure to be used to develop stabiliser codes. However, there is no practical reason that the subsystems should have the same local dimension and in this article we introduce a stabiliser formalism for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. of the form ${\mathbb C}^{D_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbb C}^{D_n}$. More generally, we define and prove a Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes of mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces. We redefine entanglement measures for these Hilbert spaces and follow \cite{HESG2018} and define absolutely maximally entangled states as states which maximise this entanglement measure. We provide examples of absolutely maximally entangled states in spaces of dimensions not previously known to have absolutely maximally entangled states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I further continue an investigation on Beltrami Flows began in 2015 with A. Sorin and amply revised and developed in 2022 with M. Trigiante. Instead of a compact $3$-torus $T^3=\mathbb{R}^3/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a crystallographic lattice, as done in previous work, here I considered flows confined in a cylinder with identified opposite bases. In this topology I considered axial symmetric flows and found a complete basis of axial symmetric harmonic $1$-forms that, for each energy level, decomposes into six components: two Beltrami, two anti-Beltrami and two closed forms. These objects, that are written in terms of trigonometric and Bessel functions, constitute a function basis for an $L^2$ space of axial symmetric flows. I have presented a general scheme for the search of axial symmetric solutions of Navier Stokes equation by reducing the latter to an hierachy of quadratic relations on the development coefficients of the flow in the above described functional basis. It is proposed that the coefficients can be determined by means of a Physics Informed like Neural Network optimization recursive algorithm. Indeed the present paper provides the theoretical foundations for such a algorithmic construction that is planned for a future publication.</description>
