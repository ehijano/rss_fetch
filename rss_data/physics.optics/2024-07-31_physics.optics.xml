      <title>The Fano and EIT-like resonance characteristic of asymmetric double micro-ring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By breaking the symmetrical arrangement of double micro-ring resonator, the formation mechanism and performance of reflection and transmission spectrum and optical field distribution are investigated. The reflection spectrum is Fano shape. The Fano resonance has an asymmetric and sharp resonance peak can be independently tuned by changing the asymmetric coupling factor of the first micro-ring. The transmission spectrum is electromagnetically induced transparency(EIT)-like shape. The (EIT)-like resonance can be independently tuned by changing the absorption factor and the phase shift factor of the second micro-ring. The Fano and EIT-like resonance have low loss and high near-field localization characteristics, our research has promising applications in optical communication and opto-electronic modulators.</description>

      <title>Spatial sub-Rayleigh imaging via structured speckle illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a lens-assisted imaging scheme with speckle illumination, the spatial resolution can surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ with second-order auto-correlation of light intensity. In this work, integrated with the nonlinear structured illumination after the speckle sinusoidally modulated, the second-order auto-correlation imaging can surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit by a factor of $2+\sqrt{2}$. In theory, a higher spatial resolution with the surpassing factor $N+\sqrt{N}$ is available by the $N$-order auto-correlation measurement. Our imaging scheme combined two super-resolution technologies not only enhances the spatial resolution of the lens-assisted imaging, but also promotes the practicality of the intensity correlation imaging.</description>

      <title>Efficient, gigapixel-scale, aberration-free whole slide scanner using angular ptychographic imaging with closed-form solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole slide imaging provides a wide field-of-view (FOV) across cross-sections of biopsy or surgery samples, significantly facilitating pathological analysis and clinical diagnosis. Such high-quality images that enable detailed visualization of cellular and tissue structures are essential for effective patient care and treatment planning. To obtain such high-quality images for pathology applications, there is a need for scanners with high spatial bandwidth products, free from aberrations, and without the requirement for z-scanning. Here we report a whole slide imaging system based on angular ptychographic imaging with a closed-form solution (WSI-APIC), which offers efficient, tens-of-gigapixels, large-FOV, aberration-free imaging. WSI-APIC utilizes oblique incoherent illumination for initial high-level segmentation, thereby bypassing unnecessary scanning of the background regions and enhancing image acquisition efficiency. A GPU-accelerated APIC algorithm analytically reconstructs phase images with effective digital aberration corrections and improved optical resolutions. Moreover, an auto-stitching technique based on scale-invariant feature transform ensures the seamless concatenation of whole slide phase images. In our experiment, WSI-APIC achieved an optical resolution of 772 nm using a 10x/0.25 NA objective lens and captures 80-gigapixel aberration-free phase images for a standard 76.2 mm x 25.4 mm microscopic slide.</description>

      <title>Navigation-grade interferometric air-core antiresonant fibre optic gyroscope with enhanced thermal stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a groundbreaking navigation-grade interferometric air-core fibre optic gyroscope (IFOG) using a quadrupolar-wound coil of four-tube truncated double nested antiresonant nodeless fibre (tDNANF). This state-of-the-art tDNANF simultaneously achieves low loss, low bend loss, single-spatial-mode operation, and exceptional linear polarization purity over a broad wavelength range. Our 469 m tDNANF coil demonstrated a polarization extinction ratio (PER) of ~20 dB when illuminated by an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source spanning 1525-1565 nm. Under these conditions, the gyro archives an angular random walk (ARW) of 0.0038 deg h-1/2 and a bias-stability (BS) drift over 8500 s of 0.0014 deg h-1, marking the first instance of navigation-grade performance in air-core FOGs. Additionally, we validated the low thermal sensitivity of air-core FOGs, with reductions of 9.24/10.68/6.82 compared to that of conventional polarization-maintaining solid-core FOGs of the same size across various temperature ranges. These results represent a significant step towards long-standing promise of high-precision inertial navigation applications with superior environmental adaptability.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized high harmonic beams carrying self-torque or time-dependent orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of structured light, the self-torque has been recently defined as an intrinsic property of light beams carrying time-dependent orbital angular momentum. In particular, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) beams with self-torque -- exhibiting a topological charge that continuously varies on the subfemtosecond timescale -- are naturally produced in high-order harmonic generation (HHG) when driven by two time-delayed intense infrared vortex beams with different topological charges. Until now, the polarization state of such EUV beams carrying self-torque has been restricted to linear states due to the drastic reduction in the harmonic up-conversion efficiency with increasing the ellipticity of the driving field. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how to control the polarization state of EUV beams carrying self-torque, from linear to circular. The extremely high sensitivity of HHG to the properties of the driving beam allows us to propose two different driving schemes to circumvent the current limitations to manipulate the polarization state of EUV beams with self-torque. Our advanced numerical simulations are complemented with the derivation of selection rules of angular momentum conservation, which enable precise tunability over the angular momentum properties of the harmonics with self-torque. The resulting high-order harmonic emission, carrying time-dependent orbital angular momentum with a custom polarization state, can expand the applications of ultrafast light-matter interactions, particularly in areas where dichroic or chiral properties are crucial, such as magnetic materials or chiral molecules.</description>

      <title>Normal dispersion Kerr cavity solitons: beyond the mean field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of a novel type of temporal localized structure in injected Kerr-Gires-Tournois interferometers. These bright pulses exist in the normal dispersion regime, yet they do not correspond to the usual scenario of domain wall locking that induces complex shape multi-stability, weak stability as well as a reduced domain of existence. The new states are observed beyond the mean-field limit and out of the bistable region. Their shape is uniquely defined, with peak intensities beyond that of the upper steady state, and they are stable over a broad range of the injection field, highlighting their potential for optical frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Broadband THz wave generation and detection in organic crystal PNPA at MHz repetition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals have emerged as efficient room-temperature emitters of broadband THz radiation with high electric field strengths. Although initially confined to high-pulse-energy excitation in the millijoule range with kHz rates, recent efforts have focused on tailoring the physical properties of organic NLO materials for compatibility with popular MHz-rate telecommunication wavelength lasers emitting nanojoule energy pulses. This is motivated by the large potential of such crystals for more portable and user-safe spectroscopic systems, additionally complemented by their room-temperature field-sensitive THz detection capabilities. In this work, we demonstrate the MHz-rate operation of the organic crystal PNPA ((E)-4-((4-nitrobenzylidene)amino)-$N$-phenylaniline), which was recently discovered through data mining algorithms and reported to surpass the conversion efficiency of rivaling NLO crystals at 1 kHz repetition rate. Using a compact 200 mW Er:fiber laser producing 18 fs pulses at 50 MHz repetition rate, we demonstrate the THz field generation and detection capabilities of PNPA via performing gas phase spectroscopy in the 1.3-8.5 THz range. We obtain a dynamic range of 40 dB over 3.6 s and 70 dB over 2 hours. Our work extends the family of organic crystals compatible with telecommunication-wavelength excitation using nJ pulses for spectroscopy beyond 5 THz.</description>

      <title>Exact boundary-value solution for an electromagnetic wave propagating in a linearly-varying index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of electromagnetic waves in a linearly-varying index of refraction is a fundamental problem in wave physics, being relevant in fusion science for describing certain wave-based heating and diagnostic schemes. Here, an exact solution is obtained for a given incoming wavefield specified on the boundary transverse to the direction of inhomogeneity by performing a spectral, rather than asymptotic, matching. Two case studies are then presented: a Gaussian beam at oblique incidence and a speckled wavefield at normal incidence. For the Gaussian beam, it is shown that when the waist $W$ is sufficiently large, oblique incidence manifests simply as rigid translation and focal shift of the corresponding diffraction pattern at normal incidence. The destruction of the hyperbolic umbilic caustic (corresponding to a critically focused beam) as $W$ is reduced is then demonstrated. The caustic disappears once $W \lesssim \delta_a \sqrt{L}$ ($L$ being the medium lengthscale normalized by the Airy skin depth $\delta_a$), at which point the wave behavior is increasingly described by Airy functions, but experiences less focusing as a result. To maximize the intensity of a launched Gaussian beam at a turning point, one should therefore minimize the imaginary part of the launched complex beam parameter while having the real part satisfy critical focusing. For the speckled wavefield, it is shown that the transverse speckle pattern only couples to the Airy longitudinal pattern when the coupling parameter $\eta = \sqrt{L}/f_\#$ is large, with $f_\#$ being the f-number of the launching aperture. When $\eta \ll 1$, a reduced description of the total wavefield can be obtained by simply multiplying the incoming speckle pattern with the Airy swelling.</description>

      <title>Photon distillation schemes with reduced resource costs based on multiphoton Fourier interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14262v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable scheme to achieve photon distillation, i.e. the preparation of a single photon with reduced indistinguishability error out of multiple imperfect photons, based on multiphoton interference in Fourier matrices. Our scheme achieves arbitrary error reduction in a single step, removing the need to concatenate multiple rounds of the protocol. Our scheme has resource costs linear in the error reduction, and a constant probability of success for arbitrary error reductions. We find that the scheme both raises the threshold of error correcting codes in photonic quantum computers, as well as reduces the resources required to construct a photonic quantum computer, making it highly promising for implementation in such devices.</description>

      <title>X-ray nano-holotomography reconstruction with simultaneous probe retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional tomographic reconstruction, the pre-processing step includes flat-field correction, where each sample projection on the detector is divided by a reference image taken without the sample. When using coherent X-rays as probe, this approach overlooks the phase component of the illumination field (probe), leading to artifacts in phase-retrieved projection images, which are then propagated to the reconstructed 3D sample representation. The problem intensifies in nano-holotomography with focusing optics, that due to various imperfections creates high-frequency components in the probe function. Here, we present a new iterative reconstruction scheme for holotomography, simultaneously retrieving the complex-valued probe function. Implemented on GPUs, this algorithm results in 3D reconstruction resolving twice thinner layers in a 3D ALD standard sample measured using nano-holotomography.</description>

      <title>Off-axis Hartmann wavefront sensing for the GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF) red camera optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hartmann test is a method used to measure the wavefront error in a focal optical system, wherein a mask with a pattern of small holes is placed at the system's aperture stop. By taking an image at a defocused plane, the differences between the ideal and real positions of the reimaged holes (called the transverse ray aberrations) can be measured, which can then be used to estimate the wavefront error. However, the Hartmann test is usually used with an on-axis field. In this paper, we present a wavefront sensing method which generalizes the classical Hartmann test for off-axis field angles and arbitrary reference wavefronts. Our method involves taking images at two defocused planes, and then using the real reimaged hole positions on both planes to estimate the trajectories of rays from the system's exit pupil, at which the reference wavefront is situated. We then propagate the rays forward from the reference wavefront to one of the two defocused planes, in order to find the ideal reimaged hole positions, from which we can compute transverse ray aberrations. We derive and solve a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations relating transverse ray aberrations to wavefront error, using Zernike decomposition and nonlinear least squares. Our method has been verified on simulated data from the 7-lens f/2.25 red camera system of the GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF), a high resolution optical echelle spectrograph which will be a first light instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT).</description>

      <title>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, volume-law states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Specifically, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for realizing two-qubit, universal, entangling quantum gates with linear photonic elements alone. Furthermore, this method should also--at least, in principle--be generalizable to systems of neutral atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum networking requires architectures capable of dynamically reconfigurable entanglement distribution to meet diverse user needs and ensure tolerance against transmission disruptions. We introduce multihop quantum networks to improve network reach and resilience by enabling quantum communications across intermediate nodes, thus broadening network connectivity and increasing scalability. We present multihop two-qubit polarization-entanglement distribution within a quantum network at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory campus. Our system uses wavelength-selective switches for adaptive bandwidth management on a software-defined quantum network that integrates a quantum data plane with classical data and control planes, creating a flexible, reconfigurable mesh. Our network distributes entanglement across six nodes within three subnetworks, each located in a separate building, optimizing quantum state fidelity and transmission rate through adaptive resource management. Additionally, we demonstrate the network's resilience by implementing a link recovery approach that monitors and reroutes quantum resources to maintain service continuity despite link failures -- paving the way for scalable and reliable quantum networking infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Stronger sum uncertainty relations for non-Hermitian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike the uncertainty relationships of two arbitrary incompatible observables represented by the product of variances in the past, representing them by the sum of variances is better as it guarantees to be nontrivial for two incompatible operators in some special cases. Although the uncertainty relation is formulated as the sum of variances for unitary operators has been confirmed, its general forms for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators have not been yet investigated in detail. Thus, this study develops four sum uncertainty relations for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators acting on system states by utilizing an appropriate Hilbert-space metric. The compatible forms of our sum inequalities with the conventional quantum mechanics are also provided via $G$-metric formalism. Concrete examples demonstrate the validity of the purposed sum uncertainty relations in both $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phases. The proposed methods and results can help the reader to understand in-depth the usefulness of $G$-metric formalism in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and the sum uncertainty relations of incompatible operators within.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atoms trapped in microscopic optical tweezers have emerged as a growing platform for quantum science. Achieving homogeneity over the tweezers array is an important technical requirement, and our research focuses on improving it for holographic arrays generated with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). We present a series of optimization methods to calculate better holograms, fueled by precise measurement schemes. These innovations enable to achieve intensity homogeneity with a relative standard deviation of 0.3 %, shape variations below 0.5 %, and positioning errors within 70 nm. Such ultra-precise holographic optical tweezers arrays allow for the most demanding applications in quantum science with atomic arrays.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic dependence of the radiation linewidth in a phonon laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phonon laser is an important device that can generate coherent sound waves at gigahertz frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate that in a phonon laser, the radiation line width can depend on the pumping non-monotonically. This is because there are two different types of solutions whose spectra depend differently on the noise amplitude. The first solution is a zero solution, which is stable before the generation threshold and is nondegenerate. The second solution is a nonzero solution that is stable above the generation threshold and is degenerate with respect to the phase. The line width of peaks in the spectrum of the zero solution does not depend on the noise amplitude. While, the line width of the peak in the spectrum of the nonzero solution increases with increasing noise amplitude. The noise amplitude increases with temperature, and, as a result, there is a temperature above which the transition from the zero solution to the nonzero solution leads to an increase in the radiation line width. In this case, the radiation line width non-monotonically depends on the pumping.</description>

Abstract: Effective axion fields in condensed matter and photonics are manifested as $\mathcal{P}$- and $\mathcal{T}$-odd contributions to the electromagnetic response. Here, we show that the phenomena previously attributed to the effective axion fields have two distinct physical origins. One of them corresponds to the standard axion electrodynamics, while another provides its dual-symmetric version having the same symmetry and featuring similar but distinguishable optical properties. We present an example system described by the dual-symmetric modification of axion electrodynamics, derive the key predictions and pinpoint experimentally observable distinctions between the two versions of axion-type response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a large family of tensorial metasurfaces can be found that perform an identical wave transformation, showing that even when the conditions of reciprocity and passivity are imposed, there still remain many solutions to the design problem. As an example, we explore the case of a metasurface that rotates a single input polarization, showing we can parameterize the set of equivalent reciprocal metasurfaces in terms of a single complex parameter. Through allowing dissipation and gain within the response, the surface can have many different functionalities in the orthogonal polarization, opening up a new route for the design of multiplexed metasurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band structures of metamaterials described by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem are beyond the existing topological band theory. In this paper, we analyze non-Hermitian topology under the nonlinearity of eigenvalues. Specifically, we elucidate that such nonlinear systems may exhibit exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects which are unique non-Hermitian topological phenomena. The robustness of these non-Hermitian phenomena is clarified by introducing the topological invariants under nonlinearity which reproduce the existing ones in linear systems. Furthermore, our analysis elucidates that exceptional points may emerge even for systems without an internal degree of freedom where the equation is single component. These nonlinearity-induced exceptional points are observed in mechanical metamaterials, e.g., the Kapitza pendulum.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear behavior of Raman Linewidth of 1-3 Layer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Raman spectroscopy of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been conducted. However, only a small portion of those studies note the full width half maximum (FWHM) of these 2D materials. FWHM is an indicator of phonon dispersions in 2D materials. In addition, it is a critical parameter that can denote the quality of the given 2D material, which is directly related to its engineering performance for manufactured devices. In this study, we analyze the effect that temperature has on the FWHM of the E2g1 mode for WSe2. We also analyze this temperature dependent trend for WSe2 with different thicknesses: monolayer (1L), bilayer (2L), and triple-layer (3L). The results show a different trend associated with each thickness on temperature dependence analysis for WSe2. The 1L WSe2 shows a parabolic trend with increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the 2L shows a steady linear trend with increasing temperature. On the other hand, FWHM for 3L WSe2 can be fitted by a simplified Klemens model, which explains its non-linear behavior.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable collective resonances induced by liquid crystals in dielectric metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17788v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can show multi-resonant response with high Q-factors in the visible range due to multipole coupling. This work suggests that these collective resonances in all-dielectric metasurfaces can be modified if adjacent to an anisotropic liquid crystal medium, opening a new path toward the dynamic metasurface effects. Using numerical full-wave simulations and the multipole decomposition technique for reflection and transmission coefficients we study the influence of the surrounding anisotropic medium on the resonant response of metasurfaces composed of disk-shaped dielectric nanoparticles. First, we consider tuning and switching the resonances induced by the polarization of the incident beam in metasurfaces placed in a medium with different orientations of LC molecules. Secondly, we study the case when the tuning of resonances is carried out by applying an external voltage that changes the orientation of LC molecules and thereby changes the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of directly tuning the resonant response of dielectric metasurfaces in an anisotropic environment, which is important for the development of optical nanodevices with dynamic switching of functional modes in the visible range.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Superlattices with Artificial Gauge Field Towards Colorless and Crosstalkless Ultrahigh-Density Photonic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense waveguides are the basic building blocks for photonic integrated circuits (PIC). Due to the rapidly increasing scale of PIC chips, high-density integration of waveguide arrays working with low crosstalk over broadband wavelength range is highly desired. However, the sub-wavelength regime of such structures has not been adequately explored in practice. Herein, we proposed a waveguide superlattice design leveraging the artificial gauge field (AGF) mechanism, corresponding to the quantum analog of field-induced n-photon resonances in semiconductor superlattices. This approach experimentally achieves -24 dB crosstalk suppression with an ultra-broad transmission bandwidth over 500 nm for dual polarizations. The fabricated waveguide superlattices support high-speed signal transmission of 112 Gbit/s with high-fidelity signal-to-noise ratio profiles and bit error rates. This design, featuring a silica upper cladding, is compatible with standard metal back end-of-the-line (BEOL) processes. Based on such a fundamental structure that can be readily transferred to other platforms, passive and active devices over versatile platforms can be realized with a significantly shrunk on-chip footprint, thus it holds great promise for significant reduction of the power consumption and cost in PICs.</description>

      <title>Unlocking new dimensions in photonic computing using optical Skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decline of Moore's law coupled with the growing dominance of artificial intelligence has recently motivated research into photonic computing as a high-bandwidth, low-power strategy to accelerate digital electronics. However, modern-day photonic computing strategies are predominantly analog, making them susceptible to noise and intrinsically difficult to scale. The optical Skyrmion offers a route to overcoming these limitations through digitization in the form of a discrete topological number that can be assigned to the analog optical field. Apart from an intrinsic robustness against perturbations, optical Skyrmions represent a new dimension that has yet to be exploited for photonic computing, namely spatially varying polarization. Here, we propose a method of performing perturbation-resilient integer arithmetic with this new dimension of optical Skyrmions through passive optical components and present experimental evidence demonstrating its feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such discrete mathematical operations have been directly achieved using optical Skyrmions without external energy input.</description>

      <title>Bistability in spatiotemporal mode-locking with dynamic multimode gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) dissipative soliton existed in spatiotemporal mode-locked (STML) multimode fiber laser has been demonstrated to be a promising formalism for generating high-energy femtosecond pulses, which unfortunately exhibit diverse spatiotemporal dynamics that have not been fully understood. Completely modeling the STML multimode fiber lasers can shed new light on the underlying physics of the spatiotemporal dynamics and thus better manipulate the generation of high-quality energic femtosecond pulses, which however is still largely unmet. To this end, here we theoretically investigate a dynamic multimode gain model of the STML multimode fiber laser by exploring the multimode rate equation (MMRE) in the framework of generalized multimode nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Using this dynamic multimode gain model, the attractor dissection theory is revisited to understand the dominant effects that determine the modal composition of 3D dissipative soliton. Specifically, by varying the numerical aperture of the multimode gain fiber (MMGF), different gain dynamics that correspond to distinct types of gain attractors are observed. As a result, two distinguishing STML operation regimes, respectively governed by the multimode gain effect and spatiotemporal saturable absorption, are identified. In the latter regime, especially, 3D dissipative solitons present bistability that there exist bifurcated solutions with two different linearly polarized (LP) mode compositions. To verify the theoretical findings, the experimental implementation shows that the state of STML can be switched between different LP modes, and confirms the presence of bistability. Particularly, the 3D-soliton shaping mechanism that is governed by the multimode gain effect is testified for the first time, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Designing rotational motion of charges on plasmonic nanostructures excited by circularly polarized light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational motion of charges in plasmonic nanostructures plays an important role in transferring angular momentum between light and matter on the nanometer scale. Although sophisticated control of rotational charge motion has been achieved using spatially structured light, its extension to simultaneous excitation of the same charge motion in multiple nanostructures is not straightforward. In this study, we perform model calculations to show that spatially homogeneous circularly polarized (CP) light can excite rotational charge motions with a high degrees of freedom by exploiting the rotational symmetry of the plasmonic structure and that of the plasmon mode. Finite-difference time-domain simulations demonstrate selective excitation of rotational charge motion for both isolated nanoplates and periodic array structures, showing that complex charge rotations can be manipulated by plane CP waves in a wide range of plasmonic structures.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Laser-induced Transient Bubble Dynamics within Microchannels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory flow in confined spaces is central to understanding physiological flows and rational design of synthetic periodic-actuation based micromachines. Using theory and experiments on oscillating flows generated through a laser-induced cavitation bubble, we associate the dynamic bubble size (fluid velocity) and bubble lifetime to the laser energy supplied - a control parameter in experiments. Employing different channel cross-section shapes, sizes and lengths, we demonstrate the characteristic scales for velocity, time and energy to depend solely on the channel geometry. Contrary to the generally assumed absence of instability in low Reynolds number flows (&lt;1000), we report a momentary flow distortion that originates due to the boundary layer separation near channel walls during flow deceleration. The emergence of distorted laminar states is characterized using two stages. First the conditions for the onset of instabilities is analyzed using the Reynolds number and Womersley number for oscillating flows. Second the growth and the ability of an instability to prevail is analyzed using the convective time scale of the flow. Our findings inform rational design of microsystems leveraging pulsatile flows via cavitation-powered microactuation.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

      <title>Considerations for extracting moir\'e-level strain from dark field intensities in transmission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bragg interferometry (BI) is an imaging technique based on four-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (4D-STEM) wherein the intensities of select overlapping Bragg disks are fit or more qualitatively analyzed in the context of simple trigonometric equations to determine local stacking order. In 4D-STEM based approaches, the collection of full diffraction patterns at each real-space position of the scanning probe allows the use of precise virtual apertures much smaller and more variable in shape than those used in conventional dark field imaging, such that even buried interfaces marginally twisted from other layers can be targeted. A coarse-grained form of dark field ptychography, BI uses simple physically derived fitting functions to extract the average structure within the illumination region and is therefore viable over large fields of view. BI has shown a particular advantage for selectively investigating the interlayer stacking and associated moir\'e reconstruction of bilayer interfaces within complex multi-layered structures. This has enabled investigation of reconstruction and substrate effects in bilayers through encapsulating hexagonal boron nitride and of select bilayer interfaces within trilayer stacks. However, the technique can be improved to provide a greater spatial resolution and probe a wider range of twisted structures, for which current limitations on acquisition parameters can lead to large illumination regions and the computationally involved post-processing can fail. Here we analyze these limitations and the computational processing in greater depth, presenting a few methods for improvement over previous works, discussing potential areas for further expansion, and illustrating the current capabilities of this approach for extracting moir\'e-scale strain.</description>
