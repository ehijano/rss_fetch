      <title>Global Gauge Symmetries and Spatial Asymptotic Boundary Conditions in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Yang-Mills gauge theory on a Euclidean Cauchy surface the group of physical gauge symmetries carrying direct empirical significance is often believed to be $\mathcal{G}_\text{DES}=\mathcal{G}^I/\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$, where $\mathcal{G}^I$ is the group of boundary-preserving gauge symmetries and $\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$ is its subgroup of transformations that are generated by the constraints of the theory. These groups are identified respectively as the gauge transformations that become constant asymptotically and those that become the identity asymptotically. In the Abelian case $G=U(1)$ the quotient is then identified as the group of global gauge symmetries, i.e. $U(1)$ itself. However, known derivations of this claim are imprecise, both mathematically and conceptually. We derive the physical gauge group rigorously for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory. Our main new point is that the requirement to restrict to $\mathcal{G}^I$ does not follow from finiteness of energy only, but also from the requirement that the Lagrangian of Yang-Mills theory be defined on a tangent bundle to configuration space. Moreover, by carefully considering the rates of asymptotic behavior of the various types of gauge transformations through conformal methods, we explain why the physical quotient consists precisely of a copy of the global gauge group for every homotopy class. Lastly, we consider Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in our framework and show that asymptotic boundary conditions and the physical gauge group differ in the unbroken and broken phases.</description>

      <title>Folded State Dynamics -- A Geometric and Deterministic Origin of Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central challenge in statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are limited to dilute gases and short timescales. We introduce Folded State Dynamics (FSD), a framework in which irreversibility arises from the geometric structure of phase space in systems with coupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to conventional models with unfolded, weakly coupled modes, FSD exhibits phase space folding, where deterministic coupling induces instability and chaotic mixing. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible phase space volume, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) occupy measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times Trec, resolving Loschmidt's and Zermelo's objections without coarse-graining or fine-tuning. FSD is further extended to include charged systems (cFSD), where electromagnetic interactions continuously drive phase space folding. FSD thus offers a deterministic and testable mechanism for irreversibility, with implications ranging from confined colloids to the cosmological arrow of time</description>
