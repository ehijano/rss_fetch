      <title>An Evaluation Of The Possible Effect Of Tetra-neutron Production On Ternary Fission Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of including a resonant state of four neutrons in the low-density warm nuclear equation of state, using a relativistic mean-field formalism, where in-medium effects are considered. For that purpose, the abundances of 62 different clusters immersed in a gas of protons and neutrons, are calculated with and without the presence of this resonant tetraneutron state. Ternary fission experiments are environments where not only these clusters can be formed, but also where such thermodynamic conditions of low densities and moderate temperatures can be achieved. The calculated yields of isotopes with and without the tetraneutron included are then compared with experimentally observed ternary fission yields. While the results indicate that the tetraneutron has little effect on yields of other clusters under the existing ternary fission conditions, a possibly observable effect on yields of clusters emitted from the neck region in mid-peripheral heavy ion collisions is clearly suggested.</description>

      <title>Coupled-Cluster Calculations of Infinite Nuclear Matter in the Complete Basis Limit Using Bayesian Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite nuclear matter provides valuable insights into the behavior of nuclear systems and aids our understanding of atomic nuclei and large-scale stellar objects such as neutron stars. However, partly due to the large basis needed to converge the system's binding energy, size-extensive methods such as coupled-cluster theory struggle with long computational run times, even using the nation's largest high-performance computing facilities. This research introduces a novel approach to the problem. We propose using a machine learning method to predict the coupled-cluster energies of infinite matter systems in the complete basis limit, leveraging only data collected using smaller basis sets. This method promises to deliver high-accuracy results with significantly reduced run times. The sequential regression extrapolation (SRE) algorithm, based on Gaussian processes, was created to perform these extrapolations. By combining Bayesian machine learning with a unique method of formatting the training data, we can create a powerful extrapolator that can make accurate predictions given very little data. The SRE algorithm successfully predicted the CCD(T) energies for pure neutron matter across six densities near nuclear saturation density, with an average error of 0.0083 MeV/N. The algorithm achieved an average error of 0.038 MeV/A for symmetric nuclear matter. These predictions were made with a time savings of 83.8 node hours for pure neutron matter and 284 node hours for symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, the symmetry energy at these six densities was predicted with an average error of 0.031 MeV/A and a total time savings of 368 node hours compared to the traditional converged coupled-cluster calculations performed without the SRE algorithm.</description>

      <title>Light $\Lambda$ hypernuclei studied with chiral hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of light $\Lambda$ hypernuclei in chiral effective field theory is presented. For the first time chiral $\Lambda$NN and $\Sigma$NN three-body forces are included consistently. The calculations are performed within the no-core shell model. Results for the separation energies of the hypernuclei $^3_{\Lambda}\mathrm{H}$, $^4_{\Lambda}\mathrm{H}$/$^4_{\Lambda}\mathrm{He}$, $^5_{\Lambda}\mathrm{He}$, and $^7_{\Lambda}\mathrm{Li}$ are given. It is found that the experimental values can be fairly well reproduced once YNN three-body forces are taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to investigate the simultaneous influence of two-photon effects in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and logarithmic corrections in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on certain observable experimental quantities (structure factors $A$ and $B$) in elastic electron-deuteron scattering. Analyzing these effects broadens our understanding of particle physics, particularly the manifestations of quark-gluon degrees of freedom in the deuteron.
  Keywords: elastic electron-deuteron scattering, deuteron, QCD, QED, quark, gluon, two-photon exchange effects.</description>

      <title>Tracking Energy Loss in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main modification to high $p_t$ jets evolving in the quark gluon plasma is the depletion of their energy to the thermal background. Despite the prominent role played by energy loss effects in jet quenching, their theoretical description is still limited, being, to a large extent, driven by phenomenological considerations. As the field moves towards the measurement of multi-scale jet substructure observables, it is necessary to develop new field theoretic techniques to describe energy loss. In this letter, we highlight a formal similarity between energy loss, and the renormalization group based track function formalism for computing jet substructure observables on charged particles. We introduce an energy loss function, $L_i(x)$, tracking the energy fraction $x$ flowing from an initial hard parton $i$ down to the measured hadrons, and show that its renormalization group evolution can be studied in perturbative QCD, and is related to that of the track functions. The features of this new approach are illustrated in the computation of projected energy correlators, opening the window to a better theoretical treatment of these observables in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>First Principle Predictions for Cold Fermionic Gases Near Criticality via Critical Boson Dominance and Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the authors have developed an effective field theory formalism to systematically describe cold fermionic gases near the unitary limit. The theory has enhanced predictive power due to the fact that interactions are dominated by the exchange of a gapped critical boson whose couplings and mass are fixed by matching the dilatation anomaly between the UV and IR theories. We utilize this theory to give analytic predictions for the compressibility and magnetic susceptibility for fermions near unitarity with attractive interactions above the critical temperature $T_c$, with a well defined theoretical error. The inputs to the predictions are: the scattering length $a$, the effective mass $m^\star$ and contact parameter $\tilde C(a)$. We then compare our predictions to numerical simulations and find excellent agreement within the window of scattering lengths where the EFT is valid ($10\geq \mid \! k_F a \! \mid\geq 1$). Experimental corroboration of this theory supports critical point that can be describe by the inclusion of a scalar dilaton mode, whose action is fixed by symmetries.</description>

      <title>The glue that binds us all -- Latin America and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider, a next generation electron-hadron and electron-nuclei scattering facility, will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wealth of new data will shape research in hadron physics, from nonperturbative QCD techniques to perturbative QCD improvements and global QCD analyses, for the decades to come. With the present proposal, Latin America based physicists, whose expertise lies on the theory and phenomenology side, make the case for the past and future efforts of a growing community, working hand-in-hand towards developing theoretical tools and predictions to analyze, interpret and optimize the results that will be obtained at the EIC, unveiling the role of the glue that binds us all. This effort is along the lines of various initiatives taken in the U.S., and supported by colleagues worldwide, such as the ones by the EIC User Group which were highlighted during the Snowmass Process and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).</description>

      <title>Improved modeling of $\gamma\gamma$ processes in ultraperipheral collisions at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CERN LHC is not only the current energy-frontier collider for parton-parton collisions, but has proven a powerful photon collider providing photon-photon ($\gamma\gamma$) collisions at center-of-mass energies and luminosities never reached before. The latest theoretical developments implemented in the gamma-UPC Monte Carlo (MC) event generator, which can calculate arbitrary exclusive final state produced via $\gamma\gamma$ fusion in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of protons and/or nuclei at the LHC, are presented. These include azimuthal modulations of dilepton pairs produced in the $\gamma\gamma\to\ell^+\ell^-$ process, and neutron emission probabilities for photoexcited lead ions in PbPb UPCs. A few comparisons of the results of the updated gamma-UPC v.1.6 code to relevant RHIC and LHC data are presented.</description>

      <title>Decay behavior of hidden-strange hadronic molecular state $N(2270)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically discuss the decay patterns of the hidden-strange hadronic molecular state $N(2270)$ which is assumed as an S-wave $K^\ast\Sigma^\ast$ shallow bound state with its possible quantum numbers $J^P$ which are ${1/2}^-$, ${3/2}^-$ and ${5/2}^-$. By using the effective Lagrangian approach and considering pseudo-scalar meson and vector meson exchanges, we have thoroughly calculated and discussed the decay behavior of the $N(2270)$ molecular state, including hadronic and radiative decay and the cutoff dependence, for different $J^P$ values. For all three cases, $K^\ast \Lambda$, $K^\ast \Sigma$, and $\rho N$ final states are always included as the main decay channels. However, the $K \Lambda$, $\pi N$ and $\pi \Delta$ final states exhibit notable differences. These different decay properties will provide valuable guidance for future experimental searches and aid in distinguishing different $J^P$ assumptions and understanding their internal structures.</description>

      <title>Preponderant Orbital Polarization in Relativistic Magnetovortical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function clarifies the importance of orbital angular momentum to bulk thermodynamics in addition to the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. In particular, we make an experimentally testable prediction that the orbital contribution should preponderate over the spin contribution, and thus flip the sign of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter and hadronic matter on $f$-mode oscillation of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the possible presence of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars (NSs) and the structural properties of the DM admixed NSs (DMANSs) in one of our recent works \cite{Guha:2024pnn}. The feeble interaction between the fermionic DM ($\chi$) with the hadronic matter is introduced through a dark scalar ($\phi$) and a dark vector ($\xi$) boson as mediators. The allowed range of the mass of the fermionic DM ($m_{\chi}$), for a particular range of DM Fermi momentum ($k_F^{\chi}$), was obtained in the same work \cite{Guha:2024pnn} with respect to the various astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability. The present work is dedicated to the calculation and study of non-radial oscillation of the DMANSs using Cowling approximation. We particularly investigate the effect of presence of DM on the fundamental ($f$) mode oscillation frequencies of the DMANSs utilizing the previously obtained range of $m_{\chi}$ for four different hadronic models. In this work we thoroughly investigate how the individual and combined effects of $m_{\chi}$ and $k_F^{\chi}$ affect the $f$-mode oscillation frequency. Within the framework of our DMANS models, for a particular value of $k_F^{\chi}$, the range of $f_{max}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the allowed range of $m_{\chi}$, is also obtained in the present work for four different hadronic models. Since in the present era, the 1.4 and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ NSs are of special interest after the detection of GW170817 and PSR J0740+6620, we particularly investigate, for the four hadronic models, the range of $f_{1.4}^{DMANS}$ and $f_{2.01}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the acceptable range of $m_{\chi}$ corresponding to the range of $k_F^{\chi}$.</description>

Abstract: Equal-time commutators of different components of the energy-momentum tensor at spatially separated points are calculated for a relativistic quantum Fermi gas at finite temperature and density. Different definitions of such components, also known as different pseudogauges, are used and smeared with a Gaussian profile characterized by the width $\sigma$. In this way, we introduce observables that may represent measurements of energy and momentum in a spatial region of size $\sigma$. We find that the obtained commutators are sensitive to the pseudogauge chosen if the probed systems or the spatial separation are small. The pseudogauge dependence is expected as different quantum operators are analyzed in this case. On the other hand, we find that for sufficiently large probed systems or with large separation, the studied commutators are pseudogauge independent.</description>

      <title>Study of EEC discrimination power on quark and gluon quenching effects in heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV</title>

Abstract: The energy-energy correlator (EEC) is considered as a powerful probe of jet substructure, especially a better probe of certain soft and collinear features. To study the utility of such observable for quark vs gluon discrimination of jet quenching phenomenon, this work first predicts the energy-energy correlators of inclusive jets in central~($0-10\%$) Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{\rm s}$ = 5.02 TeV for jet transverse momentum interval $40 - 60$ GeV. The Pb+Pb EEC distribution shifts to larger $R_{\rm L}$ and smaller $R_{\rm L}$ simultaneously. The shift towards larger $R_{\rm L}$ is attributed to the energy loss effect when the jet evolves in the hot/dense medium and the shift towards smaller $R_{\rm L}$ is due to the selection bias effects. Moreover, we find the EEC distribution for pure quark jets in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions will only be suffering even stronger enhancement at $R_{\rm L}&gt; 0.2$, and the EEC distribution for pure gluon jets in A+A collisions will be observed shifting toward smaller and larger $R_{\rm L}$ at the same time. The jet quenching patterns (A+A/p+p) of the quark jets and the gluon jets can then be separated. We also find that the differences are mainly determined by the initial EEC distribution in p+p, and are not affected much by the energy loss differences between quark and gluon. Inclusive jets are dominated by gluon jets, and photon-tagged jets are used to represent quark jets, we propose this double-ratio measurement to demonstrate the quark/gluon discrimination for the jet quenching phenomenon of jet substructures.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for the linearized first-order magnetohydrodynamics and implications for causality and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linear-mode analysis performed near an equilibrium configuration in the fluid rest frame with a dynamical magnetic field perturbed on a constant configuration. We develop a simple and general algorithm for an analytic solution search that works on an order-by-order basis in the derivative expansion. This method can be applied to general sets of hydrodynamic equations. Applying our method to the first-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the method finds a complete set of solutions. We obtain two sets of analytic solutions for the four and two coupled modes with seven dissipative transport coefficients. The former set has been missing in the literature for a long time due to the difficulties originating from coupled degrees of freedom and strong anisotropy provided by a magnetic field. The newly developed method resolves these difficulties. We also find that the small-momentum expansions of the solutions break down when the momentum direction is nearly perpendicular to an equilibrium magnetic field due to the presence of another small quantity, that is, a trigonometric function representing the anisotropy. We elaborate on the angle dependence of the solutions and provide alternative series representations that work near the right angle. This identifies the origin of a discrepancy found in recent works. Finally, we discuss the issues of causality and stability based on our analytic solutions and recent developments in the literature.</description>

      <title>Mass from Nothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Abelian Higgs model with multiple scalar fields, but without mass terms. Solving the model non-perturbatively order-by-order in the number of scalar fields, we find that radiative corrections generate masses for the scalar and gauge boson, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mass scales are set by the $\Lambda$-parameter of the electroweak running coupling, thereby naturally avoiding the hierarchy problem. No part of our calculation employs a weak-coupling expansion, and we find that the perturbative vacuum is metastable, and hence must decay to the stable non-perturbative vacuum of the theory, which we identify. Although the field content of our Lagrangian is standard, our results predict the existence of two heavy scalar resonances in addition to the Higgs. We believe that these predicted resonances will ultimately allow experimentalists to discriminate between our method and standard solutions of the Higgs model.</description>

Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between the observed alignment of spots in the X-ray films in cosmic ray emulsion experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. Results show that the high degree of alignment can appear at the reasonable values of transverse momentum disbalance of selected most energetic particles.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications of heavy-flavor jet angularities in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of heavy-flavor jet angularities ($\lambda_{\kappa}^{\alpha}$) in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV. The initial production of heavy-flavor jets is carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, while the jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described by the SHELL transport model. In p+p collisions, we observe narrower angularity distributions for the D$^0$-tagged jets compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the ALICE preliminary results. We then demonstrate that jet quenching in the QGP may slightly widen the angularity distributions of both inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $10&lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. Additionally, by comparing the averaged angularities $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ of inclusive, D$^0$-tagged and B$^0$-tagged jets with varying $\alpha$ and $\kappa$, we show that the larger the quark mass is, the lower the jet's $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ values are. As a result of the slenderer initial distribution, we predict that as compared to inclusive jets, the heavy-flavor jets, especially the B$^0$-tagged one, will suffer more distinct modifications of $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p at $10 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. For a larger jet radius, a more significant broadening of jet angularities could be obtained because of the enhanced contributions of the wide-angle particles. It is also noted that the angularity distributions of inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets become narrower in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $p_{\rm T,jet} &gt; 20$ GeV/c due to the strong influence of the selection bias.</description>
