      <title>Making the complete OpenAIRE citation graph easily accessible through compact data representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The OpenAIRE graph contains a large citation graph dataset, with over 200 million publications and over 2 billion citations. The current graph is available as a dump with metadata which uncompressed totals ~TB. This makes it hard to process on conventional computers. To make this network more available for the community we provide a processed OpenAIRE graph which is downscaled to 32GB, while preserving the full graph structure. Apart from this we offer the processed data in very simple format, which allows further straightforward manipulation. We also provide a python pipeline, which can be used to process the next releases of the OpenAIRE graph.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing True Influence from Hyperprolificity with Citation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately evaluating scholarly influence is essential for fair academic assessment, yet traditional bibliometric indicators - dominated by publication and citation counts - often favor hyperprolific authors over those with deeper, long-term impact. We propose the x-index, a novel citation-based metric that conceptualizes citation as a process of knowledge diffusion and incorporates citation distance to reflect the structural reach of scholarly work. By weighting citations according to the collaborative proximity between citing and cited authors, the x-index captures both the depth and breadth of influence within evolving academic networks. Empirical analyses show that the x-index significantly improves the rankings of Turing Award recipients while reducing those of hyperprolific authors, better aligning rankings with recognized academic merit. It also demonstrates superior discriminatory power among early-career researchers and reveals stronger sensitivity to institutional research quality. These results suggest that the x-index offers a more equitable and forward-looking alternative to existing metrics, with practical applications in talent identification, funding decisions, and academic recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Scientific productivity as a random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expectation that scientific productivity follows regular patterns over a career underpins many scholarly evaluations. However, recent studies of individual productivity patterns reveal a puzzle: the average number of papers published per year robustly follows the ``canonical trajectory'' of a rapid rise followed by a gradual decline, yet only about 20\% of individual productivity trajectories follow this pattern. We resolve this puzzle by modeling scientific productivity as a random walk, showing that the canonical pattern can be explained as a decrease in the variance in changes to productivity in the early-to-mid career. By empirically characterizing the variable structure of 2,085 productivity trajectories of computer science faculty at 205 PhD-granting institutions, spanning 29,119 publications over 1980--2016, we (i) discover remarkably simple patterns in both early-career and year-to-year changes to productivity, and (ii) show that a random walk model of productivity both reproduces the canonical trajectory in the average productivity and captures much of the diversity of individual-level trajectories, including the lognormal distribution of cumulative productivity observed by William Shockley in 1957. We confirm that these results generalize across fields by fitting our model to a separate panel of 22,952 faculty across 12 fields from 2011 to 2023. These results highlight the importance of variance in shaping individual scientific productivity, opening up new avenues for characterizing how systemic incentives and opportunities can be directed for aggregate effect.</description>

      <title>AutoFigure: Generating and Refining Publication-Ready Scientific Illustrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.</description>
