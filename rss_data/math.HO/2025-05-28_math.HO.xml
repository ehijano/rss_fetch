      <title>Ordine privo di periodicit\`a: il fascino matematico delle tassellazioni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a review (in Italian) on aperiodic tilings of the plane intended for a general audience. First, we recall some basic results about lattices and periodic tilings. Then, we move on to one-dimensional (domino) tilings and Wang tilings. We present a beautiful proof of the existence of an aperiodic set of Wang prototiles due to J. Kari. Next, we discuss Penrose tilings and their properties. Finally, we briefly present the recent discovery by D. Smith and his collaborators of an aperiodic monotile.</description>

      <title>Triangoli, Icosaedri e Cupole Geodetiche</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geodesic domes, convex polyhedrons with almost spherical shape or parts of them, were the subject of great attention in the twenty years between the mid-1950s and the 1970s, especially thanks to Richard Buckminster Fuller. After a building boom, mostly in the United States, their construction interest declined but their geometric characteristics, studied by various mathematicians, have unexpectedly found applications in other fields of science (Biology, Chemistry) since the mid-1950s and are still underlying models, the subject of current research. Even in the engineering-architectural field, with the revived interest in "large" reticular structures, they are analyzed and sometimes taken as inspiration. In this article, after summarizing the history of their conception and the various applications in science, we describe their main geometric characteristics and the geometric procedures most used for their construction.</description>
