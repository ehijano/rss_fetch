      <title>Spectral and combinatorial methods for efficiently computing the rank of unambiguous finite automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A zero-one matrix is a matrix with entries from $\{0, 1\}$. We study monoids containing only such matrices. A finite set of zero-one matrices generating such a monoid can be seen as the matrix representation of an unambiguous finite automaton, an important generalisation of deterministic finite automata which shares many of their good properties.
  Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set of $n \times n$ zero-one matrices generating a monoid of zero-one matrices, and $m$ be the cardinality of $\mathcal{A}$. We study the computational complexity of computing the minimum rank of a matrix in the monoid generated by $\mathcal{A}$. By using linear-algebraic techniques, we show that this problem is in $\textsf{NC}$ and can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(mn^4)$ time. We also provide a combinatorial algorithm finding a matrix of minimum rank in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2 + \omega} + mn^4)$ time, where $2 \le \omega \le 2.4$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. As a byproduct, we show a very weak version of a generalisation of the \v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture: there always exists a straight line program of size $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ describing a product resulting in a matrix of minimum rank.
  For the special case corresponding to total DFAs (that is, for the case where all matrices have exactly one 1 in each row), the minimum rank is the size of the smallest image of the set of all states under the action of a word. Our combinatorial algorithm finds a matrix of minimum rank in time $\mathcal{O}(n^3 + mn^2)$ in this case.</description>

      <title>SeQuant Framework for Symbolic and Numerical Tensor Algebra. I. Core Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks. The SeQuant source code is available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/SeQuant.</description>

      <title>Two Constraint Compilation Methods for Lifted Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.</description>
