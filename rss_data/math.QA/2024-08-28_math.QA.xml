      <title>Quantum Games and Synchronicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the flavour of categorical quantum mechanics, we extend nonlocal games to allow quantum questions and answers, using quantum sets (special symmetric dagger Frobenius algebras) and the quantum functions of arXiv:1711.07945. Equations are presented using a diagrammatic calculus for tensor categories. To this quantum question and answer setting, we extend the standard definitions, including strategies, correlations, and synchronicity, and we use these definitions to extend results about synchronicity. We extend the graph homomorphism (isomorphism) game to quantum graphs, and show it is synchronous (bisynchronous) and that its perfect quantum-commuting (bi)strategies are quantum graph homomorphisms (isomorphisms). Our extended definitions agree with the existing quantum games literature, except in the case of synchronicity.</description>

      <title>Instanton moduli space, stable envelopes and quantum difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove the degeneration limit of the quantum difference equations of instanton moduli space for both algebraic one and the Okounkov-Smirnov geometric one is the Dubrovin connection for the instanton moduli space. As an application, we prove that the Maulik-Okounkov quantum algebra of Jordan type is isomorphic to the quantum toroidal algebra $U_{q_1,q_2}(\hat{\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}}_1)$ up to some centres.</description>

      <title>R-matrices and Miura operators in 5d Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Miura operators for $W$- and $Y$-algebras from first principles as the expectation value of the intersection between a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory. The expectation value, viewed as the transition amplitude for states in the defect theories forming representations of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$, satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation and is thus interpreted as an R-matrix. To achieve this, we identify the representations associated with the line and surface defects by calculating the operator product expansions (OPEs) of local operators on the defects, as conditions that anomalous Feynman diagrams cancel each other. We then evaluate the expectation value of the defect intersection using Feynman diagrams. When the line and surface defects are specified, we demonstrate that the expectation value precisely matches the Miura operators and their products.</description>

      <title>R-matrices from Feynman Diagrams in 5d Chern-Simons Theory and Twisted M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the analogues of R-matrices that arise in 5d non-commutative topological-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory, which is known to describe twisted M-theory. We first study the intersections of line and surface operators in 5d Chern-Simons theory, which correspond to M2- and M5-branes, respectively. A Feynman diagram computation of the correlation function of this configuration furnishes an expression reminiscent of an R-matrix derivable from 4d Chern-Simons theory. We explain how this object is related to a Miura operator that is known to realize (matrix-extended) $W_{\infty}$-algebras. For 5d Chern-Simons theory with nonabelian gauge group, we then perform a Feynman diagram computation of coproducts for deformed double current algebras and matrix-extended $W_{\infty}$-algebras from fusions of M2-branes, M5-branes, and M2-M5 intersections.</description>

      <title>1+1d SPT phases with fusion category symmetry: interface modes and non-abelian Thouless pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with finite non-invertible symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ in 1+1d. In particular, we investigate interfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix product states. After revealing how to extract the $\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant, we identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the interface of two $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation theory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode between different $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the bulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the classification of one-parameter families of $\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on the explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is identified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which is the pump of a local excitation within a $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by generalizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we conjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general gapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Weyl group symmetry of q-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</description>

      <title>A strange five vertex model and multispecies ASEP on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing the stationary states of the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex model which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the conventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known results and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability derived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function of a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by Prolhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as corner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure, as questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the CTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by Cantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise connection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum group representations.</description>
