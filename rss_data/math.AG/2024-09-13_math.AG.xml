      <title>Intersection of orbits of loxodromic automorphisms of affine surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the following result: If $X_0$ is an affine surface over a field $K$ and $f, g$ are two loxodromic automorphisms with an orbit meeting infinitely many times, then $f$ and $g$ must share a common iterate. The proof uses the preliminary work of the author in [Abb23] on the dynamics of endomorphisms of affine surfaces and arguments from arithmetic dynamics. We then show a dynamical Mordell-Lang type result for surfaces in $X_0 \times X_0$.</description>

      <title>Effective nonvanishing for weighted complete intersections of codimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show Kawamata's effective nonvanishing conjecture (also known as the Ambro--Kawamata nonvanishing conjecture) holds for quasismooth weighted complete intersections of codimension $2$. Namely, for a quasismooth weighted complete intersection $X$ of codimension $2$ and an ample Cartier divisor $H$ on $X$ such that $H-K_X$ is ample, the linear system $|H|$ is nonempty.</description>

      <title>2-Gorenstein stable surfaces with $K_X^2 = 1$ and $\chi(X) = 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compactification $\overline M_{1,3}$ of the Gieseker moduli space of surfaces of general type with $K_X^2 =1 $ and $\chi(X)=3$ in the moduli space of stable surfaces parametrises so-called stable I-surfaces.
  We classify all such surfaces which are 2-Gorenstein into four types using a mix of algebraic and geometric techniques. We find a new divisor in the closure of the Gieseker component and a new irreducible component of the moduli space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be an irreducible variety and Bir(X) its group of birational transformations. We show that the group structure of Bir(X) determines whether X is rational and whether X is ruled.
  Additionally, we prove that any Borel subgroup of Bir(X) has derived length at most twice the dimension of X, with equality occurring if and only if X is rational and the Borel subgroup is standard. We also provide examples of non-standard Borel subgroups of Bir(P^n) and Aut(A^n), thereby resolving conjectures by Popov and Furter-Poloni.</description>

      <title>A note on combinatorial type and splitting invariants of plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Splitting invariants are effective for distinguishing the embedded topology of plane curves. In this note, we introduce a generalization of splitting invariants, called the G-combinatorial type, for plane curves by using the modified plumbing graph defined by Hironaka [14]. We prove that the G-combinatorial type is invariant under certain homeomorphisms based on the arguments of Waldhausen [32, 33] and Neumann [22]. Furthermore, we distinguish the embedded topology of quasi-triangular curves by the G-combinatorial type, which are generalization of triangular curves studied in [4].</description>

      <title>The section conjecture for the toric fundamental group over $p$-adic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The toric fundamental group is the smallest extension of the \'etale fundamental group which can manage the monodromy of line bundles, in addition to the monodromy of finite \'etale covers. It is an extension of the \'etale fundamental group by a projective limit of tori.
  We prove the analogue of Grothendieck's section conjecture for the toric fundamental group over finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend Saia's results on the characterization of Newton non-degenerate ideals to the context of ideals in $O_{X(S)}$, where $X(S)$ is an affine toric variety defined by the semigroup $S\subset \mathbb{Z}^{n}_{+}$. We explore the relationship between the integral closure of ideals and the Newton polyhedron. We introduce and characterize non-degenerate ideals, showing that their integral closure is generated by specific monomials related to the Newton polyhedron.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of derived rigid spaces and quasi-coherent sheaves and analytic crystals on them. Amongst other things, we obtain a six-functor formalism for these quasi-coherent sheaves and analytic crystals. We provide evidence that the category of analytic crystals is related to the theory of D-cap-modules introduced by Ardakov--Wadsley.</description>

      <title>On the positivity and integrality of coefficients of mirror maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present natural conjectural generalizations of the `positivity and integrality of mirror maps' phenomenon, encompassing the mirror maps appearing in the Batyrev--Borisov construction of mirror Calabi--Yau complete intersections in Fano toric varieties as a special case. We find that, given the combinatorial data from which one constructs a mirror pair of Calabi--Yau complete intersections, there are two ways of writing down an associated `mirror map': one which is the `true mirror map', meaning the one which appears in mirror symmetry theorems; and one which is the `naive mirror map'. The two are equal under a certain combinatorial criterion which holds e.g. for the quintic threefold, but not in general. We conjecture (based on substantial computer checks, together with proofs under extra hypotheses) that the naive mirror map always has positive integer coefficients, while the true mirror map always has integer (but not necessarily positive) coefficients. Almost all previous works on the integrality of mirror maps concern the naive mirror map, and in particular, only apply to the true mirror map under the combinatorial criterion mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Quantum cohomology and Fukaya summands from monotone Lagrangian tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a monotone Lagrangian torus inside a compact symplectic manifold $X$, with superpotential $W_L$. We show that a geometrically-defined closed-open map induces a decomposition of the quantum cohomology $\operatorname{QH}^*(X)$ into a product, where one factor is the localisation of the Jacobian ring $\operatorname{Jac} W_L$ at the set of isolated critical points of $W_L$. The proof involves describing the summands of the Fukaya category corresponding to this factor -- verifying the expectations of mirror symmetry -- and establishing an automatic generation criterion in the style of Ganatra and Sanda, which may be of independent interest. We apply our results to understanding the structure of quantum cohomology and to constraining the possible superpotentials of monotone tori</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper builds one-cusped complex hyperbolic $2$-manifolds by an explicit geometric construction. Specifically, for each odd $d \ge 1$ there is a smooth projective surface $Z_d$ with $c_1^2(Z_d) = c_2(Z_d) = 6d$ and a smooth irreducible curve $E_d$ on $Z_d$ of genus one so that $Z_d \smallsetminus E_d$ admits a finite volume uniformization by the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^2$ in $\mathbb{C}^2$. This produces one-cusped complex hyperbolic $2$-manifolds of arbitrarily large volume. As a consequence, the $3$-dimensional nilmanifold of Euler number $12d$ bounds geometrically for all odd $d \ge 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A possible way of constructing polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of higher genera facilitates integration kernels, which can be derived from generating functions incorporating the geometry of the surface. Functional relations between polylogarithms rely on identities for those integration kernels. In this article, we derive identities for Enriquez' meromorphic generating function and investigate the implications for the associated integration kernels. The resulting identities are shown to be exhaustive and therefore reproduce all identities for Enriquez' kernels conjectured in arXiv:2407.11476 recently.</description>

Abstract: The central fiber of a Gross-Siebert type toric degeneration is known to satisfy homological mirror symmetry: its category of coherent sheaves is equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya category of a certain exact symplectic manifold. Here we show that, in the Calabi-Yau case, the images of line bundles are represented by Lagrangian spheres.</description>

      <title>Toric degenerations of cluster varieties and cluster duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.08369v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a $Y$-pattern with coefficients and its geometric counterpart: a cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety with coefficients. We use these constructions to build a flat degeneration of every skew-symmetrizable specially completed cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety $\widehat{\mathcal{X}}$ to the toric variety associated to its $\mathbf{g}$-fan. Moreover, we show that the fibers of this family are stratified in a natural way, with strata the specially completed $\mathcal{X}$-varieties encoded by $\mathrm{Star}(\tau)$ for each cone $\tau$ of the $\mathbf{g}$-fan. These strata degenerate to the associated toric strata of the central fiber. We further show that the family is cluster dual to $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{prin}}$ of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, and the fibers cluster dual to $\mathcal{A}_t$. Finally, we give two applications. First, we use our construction to identify the Rietsch-Williams toric degeneration of Grassmannians with the Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich degeneration in the case of $\mathrm{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^5)$. Next, we use it to link cluster duality to Batyrev-Borisov duality of Gorenstein toric Fanos in the context of mirror symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex projective variety. Suppose that the group of birational automorphisms of $X$ contains finite subgroups isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^r$ for $r$ fixed and $N$ arbitrarily large. We show that $r$ does not exceed $2\dim(X)$. Moreover, the equality holds if and only if $X$ is birational to an abelian variety. We also show that an analogous result holds for groups of bimeromorphic automorphisms of compact K\"ahler spaces, under some additional assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper classifies spherical objects in various geometric settings in dimensions two and three, including both minimal and partial crepant resolutions of Kleinian singularities, as well as arbitrary flopping 3-fold contractions with only Gorenstein terminal singularities. The main result is much more general: in each such setting, we prove that all objects in the associated null category with no negative Ext groups are the image, under the action of an appropriate braid or pure braid group, of some object in the heart of a bounded t-structure. The corollary is that all objects which admit no negative Exts, and for which the self-Hom space is one dimensional, are the images of the simples. A variation on this argument goes further, and classifies all bounded t-structures. There are multiple geometric, topological and algebraic consequences, primarily to autoequivalences and stability conditions. Our main new technique also extends into representation theory, and we establish that in the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which is silting discrete, every object with no negative Ext groups lies in the heart of a bounded t-structure. As a consequence, every semibrick complex can be completed to a simple minded collection.</description>

      <title>Derived deformation theory of crepant curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper determines the full derived deformation theory of certain smooth rational curves C in Calabi-Yau 3-folds, by determining all higher A_\infty-products in its controlling DG-algebra. This geometric setup includes very general cases where C does not contract, cases where the curve neighbourhood is not rational, all known simple smooth 3-fold flops, and all known divisorial contractions to curves. As a corollary, it is shown that the noncommutative deformation theory of C can be described as a superpotential algebra derived from what we call free necklace polynomials, which are elements in the free algebra obtained via a closed formula from combinatorial gluing data. The description of these polynomials, together with the above results, establishes a suitably interpreted string theory prediction due to Ferrari, Aspinwall-Katz and Curto-Morrison. Perhaps most significantly, the main results give both the language and evidence to finally formulate new contractibility conjectures for rational curves in CY 3-folds, which lift Artin's celebrated results from surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We define and study Jacobians of Hodge structures with weight greater than 1. Jacobians of weight 2 naturally come up in the context of the Brauer group and the Tate conjecture. They were previously studied in a special case by Beauville in his work on surfaces of maximal Picard number, and are related to the work of Totaro on Hodge structures with no middle pieces. Higher-weight Jacobians are complex tori, and it is generally quite difficult to tell if they are algebraic. After discussing some general theory, we compute numerous examples of Jacobians of various weights for special classes of varieties: abelian varieties of maximal Picard number, Kummer varieties, and singular K3 surfaces. It turns out that all of these Jacobians are algebraic. We compute their fields of definition.</description>

      <title>Complex structure degenerations and collapsing of Calabi-Yau metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.03368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we make progress on understanding the collapsing behavior of Calabi-Yau metrics on a degenerating family of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the case of a family of smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in projective space degenerating into the transversal union of two smooth Fano hypersurfaces in a generic way, we obtain a complete result in all dimensions establishing explicit and precise relationships between the metric collapsing and complex structure degenerations. This result is new even in complex dimension two. This is achieved via gluing and singular perturbation techniques, and a key geometric ingredient involving the construction of certain (not necessarily smooth) K\"ahler metrics with torus symmetry. We also discuss possible extensions of this result to more general settings.</description>

      <title>Commutative avatars of representations of semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we announce the construction and properties of a big commutative subalgebra of the Kirillov algebra, called big algebra, attached to a finite dimensional irreducible representation of a complex semisimple Lie group. They are commutative finite flat algebras over the cohomology of the classifying space of the group. They are isomorphic with the equivariant intersection cohomology of affine Schubert varieties, endowing them with a new ring structure. Study of the finer aspects of the structure of the big algebras will also furnish the stalks of the intersection cohomology with ring structure, thus ringifying Lusztig's q-weight multiplicity polynomials i.e. affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.</description>

      <title>Tensor structures on fibered categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a small category admitting binary products. We show that the whole theory of monoidal $\mathcal{S}$-fibered categories, which is customarily formulated in terms of the usual internal tensor product, can be rephrased purely in terms of the associated external tensor product. More precisely, we construct a canonical dictionary relating the classical structures and properties of the internal tensor product to analogous structures and properties of the external tensor product: this applies to associativity, commutativity, and unit constraints, to projection formulae, as well as to monoidality of morphisms between monoidal $\mathcal{S}$-fibered categories. For instance, we show how Mac Lane's classical pentagon and hexagon axioms can be stated using the external tensor product. Our results provide a satisfactory abstract framework to study monoidal structures in the setting of perverse sheaves.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic solutions to KZ equations, ordinary crystals, and $p^s$-hypergeometric solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the KZ connection associated with a family of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Then the dual connection is the Gauss-Manin connection of that family. We observe that the Gauss-Manin connection has an ordinary $F$-crystal structure and its unit root subcrystal is of rank $g$. We prove that all local flat sections of the KZ connection annihilate the unite root subcrystal, and the space of all local flat sections of the KZ connection is a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module of rank $g$. We also consider the reduction modulo $p^s$ of the unit root subcrystal for any $s\geq 1$. We prove that its annihilator is generated by the so-called $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections of the KZ connection. In particular, that means that the reduction modulo $p^s$ of an arbitrary local flat section of the KZ connection over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a linear combination of the $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections.</description>
