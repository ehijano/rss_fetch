      <title>Intrinsic momentum transport driven by almost-rational surfaces in tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a symmetry of the local gyrokinetic model is broken when the safety factor q is almost (but not exactly) a rational number and magnetic shear is $\hat{s} \approx 0$. Tokamaks with such a q profile will spontaneously rotate due to turbulent momentum transport. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations indicate this mechanism is significantly stronger than all other drives of intrinsic rotation. It also generates intrinsic electric current that pulls q towards rational values, potentially aiding non-inductive current drive. This is likely important in the triggering of internal transport barriers.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Operating Regimes of Pulsed Plasma Accelerators for Efficient Propellant Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) acceleration modes in pulsed plasma thrusters has been verified using the magnetic extension of Rankine-Hugoniot theory. However, the impact of initial conditions within the accelerator volume on the formation and structure of these modes remains poorly understood. This work develops a regime map to clarify how key initial conditions - such as propellant gas dynamics, pulse energy, and the timing between propellant injection and discharge initiation - govern transitions between two distinct MHD operating modes, a magneto-detonation and magneto-deflagration, along with an unstable transition regime that connects them. To characterize these regimes, a combination of time-of-flight and thrust stand diagnostics was used to assess their properties, scalability, and structure while operating with air. Time-of-flight measurements reveal that reducing the initial downstream propellant mass ($m_{dwn}$) of air from 120 $\mu$g to 60 $\mu$g shifts the thruster from the magneto-detonation to the magneto-deflagration regime, increasing exhaust velocity ($v_{ex}$) from 20 km/s to 55 km/s. In this regime, the thruster exhibits improved propellant utilization as less mass is injected. At a constant 8 kA of peak current, specific impulse (Isp) increases from ~100-2000 s as $m_{dwn}$ decreases from 70 to 10 $\mu$g, corresponding to an increase in utilization efficiency ($\eta$util) from 5% to 35%. Thrust-to-power ratios, measured using a thrust stand, also improve with peak current in the magneto-deflagration regime, increasing from 4.5 mN/kW to 8 mN/kW and 6.7 mN/kW for injected mass bits of 25 $\mu$g and 50 $\mu$g, respectively. This work provides critical insights into how the initial conditions in pulsed plasma thrusters dictate the formation of ionization waves, structure of plumes, and the performance of thrusters.</description>

      <title>Validation of a Comprehensive First-Principles-Based Framework for Predicting the Performance of Future Stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the validation of the $\texttt{GENE-KNOSOS-Tango}$ framework for recovering both the steady-state plasma profiles in the considered radial domain and selected turbulence trends in a stellarator. This framework couples the gyrokinetic turbulence code $\texttt{GENE}$, the neoclassical transport code $\texttt{KNOSOS}$, and the transport solver $\texttt{Tango}$ in a multi-timescale simulation feedback loop. Ion-scale kinetic-electron and electron-scale adiabatic-ion flux-tube simulations were performed to evolve the density and temperature profiles for four OP1.2b W7-X scenarios. The simulated density and temperature profiles showed good agreement with the experimental data using a reasonable set of boundary conditions. Equally important was the reproduction of observed trends for several turbulence properties, such as density fluctuations and turbulent heat diffusivities. Key effects were also touched upon, such as electron-scale turbulence and the neoclassical radial electric field shear. The validation of the $\texttt{GENE-KNOSOS-Tango}$ framework enables credible predictions of physical phenomena in stellarators and reactor performance based on a given set of edge parameters.</description>

      <title>Atomic and Molecular Nitrogen Ions at the Dayside Magnetopause During the 2024 Mother's Day Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion measurements made with the Hot Plasma Composition Analyzers of the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS-HPCAs) during the Mother's Day Storm (Gannon Storm) of 10-13 May 2024 yield the first observations of atomic and molecular nitrogen ions in the Earth's dayside outer magnetosphere. A population of ions identified as doubly charged nitrogen and oxygen was also measured. These observations were made within a highly compressed magnetosphere at a geocentric distance of ~6 Earth Radii during the early recovery phase of the storm. From the ion composition measurements and accompanying magnetic field data, we determine the reconnection rate at the magnetopause; we compare this result to a model reconnection rate that assumes the presence of only atomic oxygen and hydrogen. The heavy ion-laden-mass density in the magnetosphere was greater than the shocked solar wind mass density in the magnetosheath. Despite these conditions, magnetic reconnection still occurred at the magnetopause.</description>

      <title>Collider-quality electron bunches from an all-optical plasma photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating collider-quality electron bunches using a plasma photoinjector. The approach leverages recently developed techniques for the spatiotemporal control of laser pulses to produce a moving ionization front in a nonlinear plasma wave. The moving ionization front generates an electron bunch with a current profile that balances the longitudinal electric field of an electron beam-driven plasma wave, creating a uniform accelerating field across the bunch. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the ionization stage show the formation of an electron bunch with 220 pC charge and low emittance ($\epsilon_x = 171$ nm-rad, $\epsilon_y = 76$ nm-rad). Quasistatic PIC simulations of the acceleration stage show that the bunch is efficiently accelerated to 20 GeV over 2 meters with a final energy spread of less than 1\% and emittances of $\epsilon_x = 177$ nm-rad and $\epsilon_y = 82$ nm-rad. This high-quality electron bunch meets the requirements outlined by the Snowmass process for intermediate-energy colliders and compares favorably to the beam quality of proposed and existing accelerator facilities. The results establish the feasibility of plasma photoinjectors for future collider applications making a significant step towards the realization of high-luminosity, compact accelerators for particle physics research.</description>

      <title>Interpreting AI for Fusion: an application to Plasma Profile Analysis for Tearing Mode Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI models have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for various tokamak instabilities--including tearing modes (TM), ELMs, and disruptive events--but their opaque nature raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness when applied to fusion power plants. Here, we present a physics-based interpretation framework using a TM prediction model as a first demonstration that is validated through a dedicated DIII-D TM avoidance experiment. By applying Shapley analysis, we identify how profiles such as rotation, temperature, and density contribute to the model's prediction of TM stability. Our analysis shows that in our experimental scenario, peaked rotation profiles are lightly stabilizing, but core electron temperature and density profile shape play the primary role in TM stability. This work offers a generalizable ML-based event prediction methodology, from training to physics-driven interpretability, bridging the gap between physics understanding and opaque ML models.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the Erice Workshop: A new baseline for the hybrid, asymmetric, linear Higgs factory HALHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The HALHF collaboration has discussed a new baseline for the project, taking into account comments from the accelerator community on various aspects of the original design. In particular, these concerned the practicality of the dual-purpose linac to accelerate both colliding positron bunches and the drive beams required for the plasma linac. In addition, many other aspects of the project were also considered; the discussion and conclusions are documented in this paper. Finally, a new baseline is outlined that has been optimised and addresses several weaknesses in the original design, has higher luminosity, reduced centre-of-mass energy boost and additional features such as positron polarization as well as electron polarization. Although HALHF has become longer and more expensive, it remains significantly smaller and cheaper than other mature Higgs factory designs currently under discussion.</description>
