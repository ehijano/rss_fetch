      <title>Saturation of magnetised plasma turbulence by propagating zonal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly driven ion-scale turbulence in tokamak plasmas is shown to be regulated by a new propagating zonal flow mode, the toroidal secondary, which is nonlinearly supported by the turbulence. The mode grows and propagates due to the combined effects of zonal flow shearing and advection by the magnetic drift. Above a threshold in the turbulence level, small-scale toroidal secondary modes become unstable and shear apart turbulent eddies, forcing the turbulence level to remain near the threshold. By including the new zonal flow physics into a theory of turbulence saturation based on the critical balance conjecture, scaling laws for the turbulent heat flux, fluctuation spectra, and zonal flow amplitude are derived and shown to be satisfied in nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Applications to Computational Plasma Physics and Reduced-Order Plasma Modeling: A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) provides a broad spectrum of tools and architectures that enable the transformation of data from simulations and experiments into useful and explainable science, thereby augmenting domain knowledge. Furthermore, ML-enhanced numerical modelling can revamp scientific computing for real-world complex engineering systems, creating unique opportunities to examine the operation of the technologies in detail and automate their optimization and control. In recent years, ML applications have seen significant growth across various scientific domains, particularly in fluid mechanics, where ML has shown great promise in enhancing computational modeling of fluid flows. In contrast, ML applications in numerical plasma physics research remain relatively limited in scope and extent. Despite this, the close relationship between fluid mechanics and plasma physics presents a valuable opportunity to create a roadmap for transferring ML advances in fluid flow modeling to computational plasma physics. This Perspective aims to outline such a roadmap. We begin by discussing some general fundamental aspects of ML, including the various categories of ML algorithms and the different types of problems that can be solved with the help of ML. With regard to each problem type, we then present specific examples from the use of ML in computational fluid dynamics, reviewing several insightful prior efforts. We also review recent ML applications in plasma physics for each problem type. The paper discusses promising future directions and development pathways for ML in plasma modelling within the different application areas. Additionally, we point out prominent challenges that must be addressed to realize ML's full potential in computational plasma physics, including the need for cost-effective high-fidelity simulation tools for extensive data generation.</description>

      <title>Achievement of highly radiating plasma in negative triangularity and effect of reactor-relevant seeded impurities on confinement and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first achievement of highly radiating plasmas in negative triangularity is shown with an operational space featuring high core radiation at high Greenwald fraction obtained with the injection of reactor-relevant seeded gases. These negative triangularity (NT) shape diverted discharges reach high values of normalized plasma pressure (BetaN &gt; 2) at high radiation fraction with no ELMs. We demonstrate that as long as the impurity level in the core is kept low to avoid excessive fuel dilution and impurity accumulation, integration of NT configuration with high radiation fraction not only is achievable but it can lead to confinement improvement with stabilization effects originating from collisionality, ExB shear and profiles changes due to impurity radiation cooling. The underlying physics mechanism is robust and holds for a variety of impurity species. The absence of the requirement to stay in H-mode translates in a higher core radiation fraction potentially allowed in NT shape effectively mitigating the power exhaust issue. The results presented here demonstrate a path to high performance, ELM free and highly radiative regime with rector-relevant seeding gases making this regime a potential new scenario for reactor operation.</description>

      <title>Compression of high-power laser pulse leads to increase of electron acceleration efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagation of ultrarelativistically intense laser pulse in a self-trapping mode in a near critical density plasma makes it possible to produce electron bunches of extreme parameters appropriate for different state of art applications. Based on the 3D PIC simulations, it has been demonstrated how the best efficiency of electron acceleration in terms of the total charge of high-energy electrons and laser-to-electrons conversion rate can be achieved. For given laser pulse energy the universal way is a proper matching of laser hot spot size and electron plasma density to the laser pulse duration. The recommendation to achieve the highest yield of high-energy electrons is to compress laser pulse as much as possible. As example, compression of the few tens fs pulse to the 10 fs pulse leads to generation of the high-energy electron bunch with the highest total charge to exhibit conversion efficiency exceeding 50% for the Joule-level laser pulse energies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of radiation profiles in a strongly baffled divertor on MAST Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma detachment involves interactions of the plasma with impurities and neutral particles, leading to significant losses of plasma power, momentum, and particles. Accurate mapping of plasma emissivity in the divertor and X-point region is essential for assessing the relationship between particle flux and radiative detachment. The recently validated InfraRed Video Bolometer (IRVB) diagnostic, in MAST-U enables this mapping with higher spatial resolution than more established methods like resistive bolometers. In previous preliminary work, the evolution of radiative detachment was characterised in L-mode (power entering the scrape-off layer, PSOL ~0.4MW). With a conventional divertor the inner leg consistently detached ahead of the outer leg, and radiative detachment preceded particle flux detachment. This work presents results also from the third MAST-U experimental campaign, fuelled from the low field side instead of the high field side, including Ohmic and beam heated L-mode shots (with a power exiting the core up to PSOL ~1-1.5MW). The radiation peak moves upstream from the target at lower upstream densities than the ion target flux roll-over (typically considered the detachment onset), while the inner leg detaches before the outer one. The movement of the radiation is in partial agreement with the expectations from the DLS model, predicting a sudden shift from the target to the X-point. The energy confinement is found to be related to detachment, but there seems to be some margin between the radiation on the inner leg reaching the X-point and confinement being affected, a beneficial characteristic if it could be extrapolated to future reactors. For increasing PSOL the particle flux roll over is almost unaffected, while radiative detachment occurs at higher density in both legs, but much higher on the outer, suggesting an uneven distribution of the power exiting the core.</description>

      <title>The role of non-linear Landau damping for cosmic-ray transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first assessment, using hybrid PIC simulations, of the role of non-linear Landau damping in the process of self-generated scattering in a high $\beta$ plasma, conditions appropriate for CR scattering in the halo of the Galaxy. This damping process manifests itself in the form of heating of the background plasma and reduction of the drift speed of CRs that yet remains super-Alfvenic. We also show that the damping leads to an inverse cascade process, consisting of producing non-resonant large scale modes, a novel result with many potential phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Lower Temporal Limit of Laser-Produced Plasma Sources for Table-Top Soft X-ray NEXAFS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements for understanding dynamics in molecular and material systems has led to many advances in table-top sources for pulsed X-rays. We report on a table top laser-produced plasma (LPP) source that can perform soft X-ray (SXR), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements using a laser source with 23 ps pulse duration. The spectrometer's key specifications, such as brilliance, resolution, and stability, are characterized against the more commonly used longer-pulse-duration LPP sources. The 23 ps laser produced approximately an order of magnitude weaker SXR flux than the 8 ns laser for a higher power density due to the smaller total energy absorbed by the plasma. The increased repetition rate and an implemented self-referencing scheme still allowed for high-resolution, synchrotron-like NEXAFS measurements of Si3N4 and TiO2 thin films with 2.5 minute acquisition times. It was observed that degradation of the gas jet nozzle led to long-term instability of the source, which can be remediated using alternative nozzle designs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving higher temporal resolution in future time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements using table-top laser-produced plasma sources</description>

      <title>Toward Realistic Solar Flare Models: An explicit Particle-In-Cell solver in the DISPATCH framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Simulating solar flares, which involve large-scale dynamics and small-scale magnetic reconnection, poses significant computational challenges. Aims. This study aims to develop an explicit Particle-In-Cell (PIC) solver within the DISPATCH framework to model the small-scale kinetic processes in solar corona setting. This study in the first in a series with the ultimate goal to develop a hybrid PIC-MHD solver, to simulate solar flares. Methods. The PIC solver, inspired by the PhotonPlasma code, solves the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in a collisionless regime using explicit time-staggering and spatial-staggering techniques. Validation included unit tests, plasma frequency recovery, two-stream instability, and current sheet dynamics. Results. Validation tests confirmed the solver's accuracy and robustness in modeling plasma dynamics and electromagnetic fields. Conclusions. The integration of the explicit PIC solver into the DISPATCH framework is the first step towards bridging the gap between large and small scale dynamics, providing a robust platform for future solar physics research.</description>

      <title>Observed Fluctuation Enhancement and Departure from WKB Theory in Sub-Alfv\'enic Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Parker Solar Probe data from orbits 8 through 17, we examine fluctuation amplitudes throughout the critical region where the solar wind flow speed approaches and then exceeds the Alfv\'en wave speed, taking account of various exigencies of the plasma data. In contrast to WKB theory for non-interacting Alfv\'en waves streaming away from the Sun, the magnetic and kinetic fluctuation energies per unit volume are not monotonically decreasing. Instead, there is clear violation of conservation of standard WKB wave action, which is consistent with previous indications of strong in-situ fluctuation energy input in the solar wind near the Alfv\'en critical region. This points to strong violations of WKB theory due to nonlinearity (turbulence) and major energy input near the critical region, which we interpret as likely due to driving by large-scale coronal shear flows.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, Kinetic, and Transition regime: Spatially-segregated structure of compressive MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex physical process that emerges in multiple areas of modern physics, and in ionized environments such as interstellar gas, the magnetic field can be dynamically important. However, the exact function of the magnetic field in the ionized gas remains unclear. We use the $M_{\rm A} = \sqrt{E_{\rm k}/E_B}
  $ to describe the importance of the magnetic field measured to the turbulent motion, and reveal diverse ways of mutual interaction. At low $M_{\rm A}$ (magnetic regime), the magnetic field is well-described as force-free. Despite the strong magnetic field, the motion of gas does not stay aligned with the magnetic field. At the regime of intermediate $M_{\rm A}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), the velocity field and the magnetic field exhibit the highest degree of alignment, which is likely the result of a rapid relaxation. At high $M_{\rm A}$ (kinetic regime), both the magnetic field and the velocity field are irregular, with no alignment. We find observational counterparts to these regimes in observations of interstellar gas. The results highlight the diverse behavior of gas in MHD turbulence and guide future interpretations of the role of the magnetic field in astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Slope of Magnetic Field-Density Relation as An Indicator of Magnetic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star-formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic field is best summarized by the Cruther+ 2010 B-rho relation. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in the collapse, or the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, ${\cal M}_{\rm A}$-k$_{B-\rho}$(slope of $B-\rho$ relation) relation. This fundamental B-$\rho$-slope relation enables one to measure the Alfv\'enic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B-$\rho$ plane. It allows us to drive the following empirical $B-\rho$ relation \begin{equation}
  \frac{B}{B_c} = {\rm exp}\left(\left(\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)^{-1}\left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)\nonumber, \end{equation} which offers an excellent fit to the Cruther et al. data, where we assume ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-\rho$ relation. The foundational ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-{\rm k}_{B-\rho}$ relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of Cruther+2010, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>

      <title>Moduli Dynamics in Effective Nested Warped Geometry in Four Dimensions and Some Cosmological Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effective four-dimensional dynamics of the extra-dimensional moduli fields in curved braneworlds having nested warping, with particular emphasis on the doubly warped model which is interesting in the light of current collider constraints on the mass of the Kaluza-Klein graviton. The presence of a non-zero brane cosmological constant ($\Omega$) naturally induces an effective moduli potential in the four-dimensional action, which shows distinct features in dS ($\Omega&gt;0$) and AdS ($\Omega&lt;0$) branches. For the observationally interesting case of dS 4-branes, a metastable minimum in the potential arises along the first modulus, with no minima along the higher moduli. The underlying nested geometry also leads to interesting separable forms of the non-canonical kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, where the brane curvature directly impacts the kinetic properties of only the first modulus. The non-canonicity of the scenario has been illustrated via an explicit computation of the field space curvature. We subsequently explore the ability of curved multiply warped geometries to drive inflation with an in-built exit mechanism, by considering predominant slow roll along each modular direction on a case-by-case basis. We find slow roll on top of the metastable plateau along the first modular direction to be the most viable scenario, with the higher-dimensional moduli parametrically tuning the height of the potential without significant impact on the inflationary observables. On the other hand, while slow roll along the higher moduli can successfully inflate the background and eventually lead to an exit, consistency with observations seemingly requires unphysical hierarchies among the extra-dimensional radii, thus disfavouring such scenarios.</description>
