      <title>On the Vertex Seidel Energy of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the vertex Seidel energy via the diagonal entries of the absolute Seidel matrix. We establish a spectral formula, compute exact values for several graph families, derive bounds, and present a Coulson-type integral representation for analytical study of this invariant. We also show that vertex Seidel energy is invariant under Seidel switching and complementation.</description>

      <title>Stability of critical equipartitions of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider partitions of a finite, simple, weighted graph that minimize a spectral energy functional, defined to be the maximum of the first eigenvalues on each component. These partitions are minimized with respect to a parameter that we view as a small perturbation of a fixed combinatorial partition. It has been shown that critical points of the energy functional in this framework correspond to non-degenerate eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian if and only if the partition is bipartite. In this work we generalize this result to partitions that are not necessarily bipartite by constructing a modified graph Laplacian called the partition Laplacian. The main result states that critical points of the spectral energy functional correspond to nodal partitions of non-degenerate eigenvectors of the partition Laplacian. Furthermore, the stability of each critical point is determined entirely by the nodal deficiency of the associated eigenvector. We also consider more general signed Laplacians and prove that Courant-sharp Laplacian eigenvectors induce globally minimal partitions.</description>

      <title>On the directional growth of the resolvent norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a densely defined closed operator on a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Its resolvent is denoted by $R_A(z)=(A-zI)^{-1}$. Under very general assumptions at the point $z$, we construct a line segment $[z,z']$ in the resolvent set on which the resolvent norm grows. We obtain estimates of the type $||R_A(\zeta)|| \geq ||R_A(z)|| + C|\zeta-z|^\delta$ for $\zeta\in[z,z']$ with either $\delta=1$ or $\delta=2$. We give a number of examples involving both normal and non-normal operators, and an application to pseudospectra of matrices.</description>

      <title>Quantitative concentration inequalities for the uniform approximation of the IDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrated density of states (IDS) is a fundamental spectral quantity for quantum Hamiltonians modeling condensed matter systems, describing how densely energy levels are distributed. It can be interpreted as a volume-averaged spectral distribution. Hence, there are two equivalent definitions of the IDS related by the Pastur-Shubin formula: an operator-theoretic trace formula and a limit of normalized eigenvalue counting functions on finite volumes. We study a discrete random Schr\"odinger operator with bounded random potentials of finite-range correlations and prove a quantitative concentration inequality ensuring, with explicit high probability, that the empirical IDS (normalized eigenvalue counting function) uniformly approximates the abstract IDS trace formula within a prescribed error, thereby implying confidence regions for the IDS.</description>

      <title>Quenched path limits and periodization stability for tilted Brownian motion in Poissonian potentials on $\mathbb{H}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the existence of Brownian motion tilted by a potential of full support on hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^d$. On compact spaces, it is classical that these path limits, called Q-processes, exist and can be directly defined using the ground state of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. On non-compact spaces like $\mathbb{H}^d$, the existence fails in general.
  We show that for \emph{stationary random} potentials on $\mathbb{H}^d$ with suitable spectral and sup norm bounds, the Q-processes exist a.s. For potentials that are factors of a Poisson point process, the method works up to sup norm $(d-1)^2/8$. In this case, we also show that the path limit can be approximated by periodic potentials.
  As a tool, we use the foliated space defined by the point process. It turns out that the global ground state of this foliated space serves as a substitute for the non-existing $L^2$ ground states on the leaves of the foliation. Restricting the global ground state to a leaf gives a generalized eigenwave that can be plugged into the usual machinery to get the Q-process.</description>

      <title>Character tables are ideal Perron similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone, called the spectracone, and polytope, called the spectratope, of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). A Perron similarity is called ideal if its spectratope coincides with the conical hulls of its rows. Identifying ideal Perron similarities is of great interest in the pursuit of the longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem.
  In this work, it is shown that the character table of a finite group is an ideal Perron similarity. In addition to expanding ideal Perron similarities to include a broad class of matrices, the results unify previous works into a single, theoretical framework.
  It is demonstrated that the spectracone can be described by finitely-many group-theoretic inequalities. When the character table is real, we derive a group-theoretic formula for the volume of the projected Perron spectratope, which is a simplex. Finally, an implication for further research is given.</description>

      <title>Threshold Hierarchy for Packet-Scale Boundary Cancellation of Dirichlet Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11605v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify geometry--dependent minimal packet scales required for cancellation of boundary correlations of high--frequency Dirichlet eigenfunctions on smooth strictly convex domains. The main result is a threshold hierarchy: for zero--mean boundary weights, the energy--weighted packet average of boundary correlation coefficients vanishes once the packet length exceeds a scale determined by the vanishing order of curvature moments of the weight. In particular, the threshold $N_k/k^{1-2/d}\to\infty$ suffices when $\int_{\partial\Omega} w,d\sigma=0$, while a strictly weaker threshold applies when additionally $\int_{\partial\Omega} H,w,d\sigma=0$, reducing in dimension $d=3$ to the minimal condition $N_k\to\infty$. The thresholds follow from the boundary local Weyl law. As a structural consequence of the Rellich identity alone, the single--mode share of boundary energy within any sublinear spectral packet is of order $1/N_k$. All estimates are independent of eigenvalue monotonicity and remain stable under eigenvalue crossings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine some shape functionals, introduced by P\'olya and Makai, involving the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet-Laplacian eigenvalue for bounded, open and convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We establish new quantitative bounds, which give us key properties and information on the behavior of the optimizing sequences. In particular, we consider two kinds of reminder terms that provide information about the structure of these minimizing sequences, such as information about the thickness.</description>

      <title>Coloring outside the lines: Spectral bounds for generalized hypergraph colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that, for an oriented hypergraph with (vertex) coloring number $\chi$ and smallest and largest normalized Laplacian eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_N$, respectively, the inequality $\chi\geq (\lambda_N-\lambda_1)/\min\{\lambda_N-1,1-\lambda_1\}$ holds. We provide necessary conditions for oriented hypergraphs for which this bound is tight. Focusing on $c$-uniform unoriented hypergraphs, we then generalize the bound to the setting of \emph{$d$-proper colorings}: colorings in which no edge contains more than $d$ vertices of the same color. We also adapt our proof techniques to derive analogous spectral bounds for \emph{$d$-improper colorings} of graphs and for edge colorings of hypergraphs. Moreover, for all coloring notions considered, we provide necessary conditions under which the bound is an equality.</description>

      <title>New perturbation bounds for low rank approximation of matrices: Beyond Eckard-Young-Mirsky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with rank $r$ and spectral decomposition $A = \sum _{i=1}^r \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top, $ where $\sigma_i$ are its singular values, ordered decreasingly, and $u_i, v_i$ are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. For a parameter $1 \le p \le r$, $A_p := \sum_{i=1}^p \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading to the commonly used phrase "low-rank approximation". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. This error plays a critical role in estimating the accuracy of the output of any process involving a low-rank approximation of noisy input. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$, exploiting new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$. In many settings, we obtain notable quantitative improvements compared to classical approaches (using the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem or the Davis-Kahan theorem). This leads to a more accurate error estimate and better guarantee in the analysis of many algorithmic tasks.</description>

      <title>Sobolev multipliers and fractional Gaussian fields on Lipschitz boundaries with applications to deterministic and random acoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Applied Physics and Photonics studies of random resonators, we study in the stochastic part of this paper random acoustic operators in non-smooth bounded domains $G \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and introduce m-dissipative impedance boundary conditions containing (eigenfunction) fractional Gaussian fields. The deterministic part of the paper constructs and studies the spaces of pointwise multipliers on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$, as well as the spaces of Sobolev (distribution-type) multipliers on boundaries $\partial G$ of better regularity. These multipliers are used as generalized impedance coefficients $\zeta$ in impedance boundary conditions $\zeta p = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{v}$ accompanying the 1st order acoustic system. We study the m-dissipativity of associated acoustic operators and the discreteness of their spectra aiming the main efforts on the weakest possible assumptions on the regularity of $\zeta$. In order to pass from deterministic results to the randomization, we introduce fractional Gaussian fields (FGFs) on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$ and study their regularity. To this end, we prove that a rough Weyl-type asymptotics takes place for the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues on arbitrary compact Lipschitz boundary $\partial G$.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the First Non-zero Basic Eigenvalue on a Singular Riemannian Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the lower bounds of the first non-zero basic eigenvalue on a closed singular Riemannian manifold $(M,\mathcal{F})$ with basic mean curvature that depends on the given non-negative lower bound of the Ricci curvature of $M$ and the diameter of the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$. These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. More precisely, when the first basic eigenvalue $\lambda_1^B$ is equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{d_{M/\mathcal{F}^2}} $, where $d_{M/\mathcal{F}}$ is the diameter of the leaf space, $M$ is isometric to a mapping torus of an isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature and $\mathcal{F}$ has the form $\{[\{\text{point}\}\times N]\}$.</description>
