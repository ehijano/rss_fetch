      <title>A community-led calibration of the Zr isotope Reference Materials: NIST candidate RM 8299 and SRM 3169</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of Zr stable isotopes is rapidly expanding from the study of mass-independent to that of mass-dependent isotope effects, a variety of Zr standards have appeared in the literature. While several of these standards have been proposed as the ideal isotope reference material (iRM) against which all data should be reported, none of them have been shown to meet the compositional and/or conflict-of-interest-free distribution requirements put forth by the community. To remedy this situation, we report on a community-led effort to develop and calibrate a scale defining iRM for Zr isotopes: NIST RM 8299. Developed in partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from the widely used SRM 3169 Zr Standard Solution, the candidate RM 8299 was calibrated through an inter-laboratory study involving three laboratories. Our data show that RM 8299 meets all requirements of an ideal iRM. It is an isotopically homogeneous, high-purity reference material, that is free of isotope anomalies, and whose composition is identical to that of a major geological reservoir (Ocean Island Basalts). Furthermore, RM 8299 will be curated and distributed by NIST, a neutral, conflict-of-interest free organization, and was produced in sufficient quantities to last multiple decades. We recommend that all Zr isotope data to be reported against RM 8299. Our results also show that SRM 3169 lots #130920 and #071226 have identical composition to RM 8299. Therefore, using RM 8299 as the scale defining iRM will enable direct comparison of all future data with the vast majority of the existing literature data, both for mass-independent and mass-dependent isotope effects. To facilitate conversion of d94/90Zr values reported against other Zr standards, we provide high-precision conversion factors to the RM 8299 scale obtained using the double-spike method.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusion models for downscaling &amp; bias correction of Earth system model precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change exacerbates extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and flooding. As these events cause severe losses of property and lives, accurate high-resolution simulation of precipitation is imperative. However, existing Earth System Models (ESMs) struggle with resolving small-scale dynamics and suffer from biases, especially for extreme events. Traditional statistical bias correction and downscaling methods fall short in improving spatial structure, while recent deep learning methods lack controllability over the output and suffer from unstable training. Here, we propose a novel machine learning framework for simultaneous bias correction and downscaling. We train a generative diffusion model in a supervised way purely on observational data. We map observational and ESM data to a shared embedding space, where both are unbiased towards each other and train a conditional diffusion model to reverse the mapping. Our method can be used to correct any ESM field, as the training is independent of the ESM. Our approach ensures statistical fidelity, preserves large-scale spatial patterns and outperforms existing methods especially regarding extreme events and small-scale spatial features that are crucial for impact assessments.</description>

      <title>surfQuake: A new Python toolbox for the workflow process of seismic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: surfQuake is a new software designed to streamline the estimation of seismic source parameters. Its comprehensive set of toolboxes automate the determination of seismic arrival times, event association and locations, moment magnitude from P- or S- wave displacement spectra and moment tensor inversions within a Bayesian framework. surfQuake is programmed in Python 3 and offers the users the possibility of three programming levels for flexibility and customization. The core library allows users to integrate the core of surfQuake into their preexisting scripts, giving advanced users full control, while the Command Line Interface gives users access to an upper layer that simplifies the use of the core. Alternatively, surfQuake core is wrapped by a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and connected to a SQLite database making it accessible to users with little coding experience. The software has been fully tested with an earthquake cluster of more than 2000 events, that occurred in central Pyrenees in 2021-22. The source parameters retrieved from the cluster and the basic statistics associated with them are displayed using the surfQuake database toolbox. Additionally, we offer a web tutorial with the documentation of surfQuake and a set of usage examples for the three programming levels.</description>

      <title>Empirical quantification of rockfall reach probability: objective determination of appropriate topographic descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For rockfall hazard assessment on areas more than several km2 in size, the quantification of runout probability is usually done empirically. Classical methods use statistical distributions of reach or energy angles derived from rockfall databases. However, other topographic descriptors can be derived from the topographic profiles along the rockfall path. Using a database of more than 4,000 profiles of rockfall paths, we determine which topographic descriptors are most appropriate for reach probability estimation, by comparing their statistical distributions for rockfall stopping points, and for points the rocks overtook. We show that the curvilinear length of the propagation path, and the area under the propagation path can improve propagation estimations, especially when they are computed only along the final portion of the propagation path. This is illustrated by comparing an experimental distribution of rockfall stopping points to the estimated distributions.</description>

      <title>Geomechanics Contribution to CO2 Storage Containment and Trapping Mechanisms in Tight Sandstone Complexes: A Case Study on Mae Moh Basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognized as a not-an-option approach to mitigate the climate crisis, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has a potential as much as gigaton of CO2 to sequestrate permanently and securely. Recent attention has been paid to store highly concentrated point-source CO2 into saline formation, of which Thailand considers one onshore case in the north located in Lampang, the Mae Moh coal-fired power plant matched with its own coal mine of Mae Moh Basin. The current study is thus aimed to examine the influence of reservoir geomechanics on CO2 storage containment and trapping mechanisms, with co-contributions from geochemistry and reservoir heterogeneity, using reservoir simulator, CMG-GEM. With the injection rate designed for 30-year injection, reservoir pressure build-ups were 77% of fracture pressure but increased to 80% when geomechanics excluded. Such pressure responses imply that storage security is associated with the geomechanics. Dominated by viscous force, CO2 plume migrated more laterally while geomechanics clearly contributed to lesser migration due to reservoir rock strength constraint. Reservoir geomechanics contributed to less plume traveling into more constrained spaces while leakage was secured, highlighting a significant and neglected influence of geomechanical factor. Spatiotemporal development of CO2 plume also confirms the geomechanics-dominant storage containment. Reservoir geomechanics as attributed to its respective reservoir fluid pressure controls development of trapping mechanisms, especially into residual and solubility traps. More secured storage containment after the injection was found with higher pressure, while less development into solubility trap was observed with lower pressure.</description>

      <title>Depletion of nonlinearity in space-analytic space-periodic solutions to equations of diffusive magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solenoidal space-periodic space-analytic solutions to the equations of magnetohydrodynamics. An elementary bound shows that due to the special structure of the nonlinear terms in the equations for modified solutions, effectively they lack a half of the spatial gradient, which appears to be a novel mechanism for depletion of nonlinearity. We present a two-phase iterative procedure yielding an expanded bound for the guaranteed time of the space analyticity of the hydrodynamic solutions. Each iteration involves two regimes: In phase 1, the enstrophy of the modified solution and the bound for the radius of the analyticity of the original solution simultaneously increase (the bound is proportional to the elapsed time since the beginning of phase 1). In phase 2, the enstrophy and bound simultaneously decrease. It is straightforward to generalize this construction for the equations of magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in unseen catchments) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model. Our results give further evidence that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision-transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 230 to 707 PFLOPS, with scaling efficiency maintained at 78% to 96% across 24,576 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>

      <title>Modeling Seismic Wave Propagation in TTI Media Using Residual Perfectly Matched Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perfectly matched layer(PML) is commonly used in wave propagation, radiation and diffraction problems in unbounded space domains. A new implementation scheme of PML is presented. The PML formulation is pre-defined, and the wave field absorption is achieved by calculating the residual between the PML equation and original equation through backward induction. Two forms of the Residual PML (RPML) are presented: RPML-1, which defines the residual as the difference between the original and PML equations, and RPML-2, which defines the residual as the difference between the original and PML wave fields. RPML-2 is the simplest and easiest to extend, as it does not alter the original equation and only has one time partial derivative term in the residual equation. Additionally, since the residual equation has no spatial partial derivative term, high-order spatial difference discretization is unnecessary, which results in higher accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, simulating a wave field in TTI media requires a high absorption effect and stability of PML. The numerical simulation demonstrates that RPML-2 provides better absorption performance and stability compared to ADEPML and NPML. To meet the needs of wave field simulation for complex media, a multiaxial complex frequency shifted RPML-2 (MCFS-RPML-2) is introduced, which employs double damping profiles and complex frequency shift technology to achieve higher stability and absorption effects.</description>

      <title>Does the Earth's rotation speed really tend to accelerate for a long time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently published studies suggested that the difference between Universal and Coordinated Time UT1-UTC could reach a large positive value in a few years, making it necessary to introduce a negative leap second into the UTC scale for the first time in its history. Based on the latest UT1 series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and its prediction, it was shown that the tendency to acceleration of the Earth's rotation observed over past four years most likely will return to the deceleration, which is the usual behavior of the Earth rotational dynamics during past decades.</description>
