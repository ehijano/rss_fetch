      <title>Trajectory Inference for Single Cell Omics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory inference is used to order single-cell omics data along a path that reflects a continuous transition between cells. This approach is useful for studying processes like cell differentiation, where a stem cell matures into a specialized cell type, or investigating state changes in pathological conditions. In the current article, we provide a general introduction to trajectory inference, explaining the concepts and assumptions underlying the different methods. We then briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different trajectory inference methods. We also describe best practices for using trajectory inference, such as how to validate the results and how to interpret them in the context of biological knowledge. Finally, the article will discuss some of the applications of trajectory inference in single-cell omics research. These applications include studying cell differentiation, development, and disease. We provide examples of how trajectory inference has been used to gain new insights into these processes.</description>

      <title>Spatial Transcriptomics Iterative Hierarchical Clustering (stIHC): A Novel Method for Identifying Spatial Gene Co-Expression Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics technologies allow researchers to simultaneously measure RNA expression levels for hundreds to thousands of genes while preserving spatial information within tissues, providing critical insights into spatial gene expression patterns, tissue organization, and gene functionality. However, existing methods for clustering spatially variable genes (SVGs) into co-expression modules often fail to detect rare or unique spatial expression patterns. To address this, we present spatial transcriptomics iterative hierarchical clustering (stIHC), a novel method for clustering SVGs into co-expression modules, representing groups of genes with shared spatial expression patterns. Through three simulations and applications to spatial transcriptomics datasets from technologies such as 10x Visium, 10x Xenium, and Spatial Transcriptomics, stIHC outperforms clustering approaches used by popular SVG detection methods, including SPARK, SPARK-X, MERINGUE, and SpatialDE. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis confirms that genes within each module share consistent biological functions, supporting the functional relevance of spatial co-expression. Robust across technologies with varying gene numbers and spatial resolution, stIHC provides a powerful tool for decoding the spatial organization of gene expression and the functional structure of complex tissues.</description>
