      <title>The Long-lived Broadband Afterglow of Short Gamma-Ray Burst 231117A and the Growing Radio-Detected Short GRB Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multiwavelength observations of the Swift short $\gamma$-ray burst GRB 231117A, localized to an underlying galaxy at redshift $z = 0.257$ at a small projected offset ($\sim 2~$kpc). We uncover long-lived X-ray (Chandra) and radio/millimeter (VLA, MeerKAT, and ALMA) afterglow emission, detected to $\sim 37~$days and $\sim 20~$days (rest frame), respectively. We measure a wide jet ($\sim 10.4^\circ$) and relatively high circumburst density ($\sim 0.07~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) compared to the short GRB population. Our data cannot be easily fit with a standard forward shock model, but they are generally well fit with the incorporation of a refreshed forward shock and a reverse shock at $&lt; 1~$day. We incorporate GRB 231117A into a larger sample of 132 X-ray detected events, 71 of which were radio-observed (17 cm-band detections), for a systematic study of the distributions of redshifts, jet and afterglow properties, galactocentric offsets, and local environments of events with and without detected radio afterglows. Compared to the entire short GRB population, the majority of radio-detected GRBs are at relatively low redshifts ($z &lt; 0.6$) and have high circumburst densities ($&gt; 10^{-2}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$), consistent with their smaller ($&lt; 8~$kpc) projected galactocentric offsets. We additionally find that 70% of short GRBs with opening angle measurements were radio-detected, indicating the importance of radio afterglows in jet measurements, especially in the cases of wide ($&gt; 10^\circ$) jets where observational evidence of collimation may only be detectable at radio wavelengths. Owing to improved observing strategies and the emergence of sensitive radio facilities, the number of radio-detected short GRBs has quadrupled in the past decade.</description>

      <title>Luminosity dependence of the multiple cyclotron lines in 4U 0115$+$63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Be X-ray binary 4U 0115$+$63 underwent a giant outburst in 2023 with the X-ray luminosity of the source reaching 10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. During the outburst, two target of opportunity observations were made with \textit{NuSTAR}. The main goal of this work is to model the multiple cyclotron scattering features (CRSFs) present in 4U 0115$+$63 and study their dependence on the luminosity of the source. The 3$-$79 keV broadband X-ray coverage of \textit{NuSTAR} allowed us to properly model the continuum and investigate the nature of the multiple cyclotron resonance scattering features present in the source spectrum. We used the epoch-folding technique to find the pulsation from the source and also studied the changes in the cyclotron line energy with an order of magnitude variation in the source luminosity. We detected five cyclotron lines during the 2023 outburst near 12, 16, 24, 34, and 47 keV. The $\sim$16 keV cyclotron line cannot be harmonically related to the other cyclotron lines at $\sim$12 keV and $\sim$24 keV. This indicates the presence of two fundamental lines in the spectrum of 4U 0115$+$63 at 12 keV and 16 keV. With the inclusion of the two latest \textit{NuSTAR} observations, we have expanded the data set of the CRSF line center to encompass a broad range of luminosity. This enables us to comprehensively investigate the relationship between the centroid energy of the cyclotron lines and luminosity. The CRSF line center shows no anticorrelation with luminosity, unlike previously reported. Instead, a weak positive correlation is found in four out of the five detected cyclotron lines of 4U 0115$+$63. The luminosity variation of the two fundamental CRSFs could be well explained with the prediction from the collisionless shock model.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global Magnetometer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis method to search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated during large energy astrophysical events such as supernovae, binary black hole or binary neutron star mergers, and fast radio bursts using the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME). In our model, the associated gravitational waves or electromagnetic signals herald the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts via coupling to the spin of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multi-messenger astronomy. The algorithm employs a model-agnostic excess-power method to identify network-wide candidate events to be subjected to a model-dependent generalized likelihood-ratio test to determine their statistical significance. We perform the first search with this technique on GNOME data coincident with the binary black hole merger S200311bg detected by LIGO/Virgo on the 11th of March 2020 and find no significant events. We place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Observational Evidence of Particles Acceleration by Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection in Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as the most energetic explosions in the modern universe have been studied over half a century, but the physics of the particle acceleration and radiation responsible for their observed spectral behaviors are still not well understood. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the pulse properties in both bright GRB~160625B and GRB~160509A, for the first time, we identify evidences of particle acceleration by relativistic magnetic reconnection from the evolutionary behavior of the two spectral breaks ($E_{\rm p}$ and $E_{\rm cut}$). Meanwhile, the adiabatic cooling process of the emitting particles in the magnetic reconnection regions produces a relation between the spectral index and the flux. We also discuss the physics behind spectral energy correlations. Finally, we argue that the identification of an anticorrelation between $E_{\rm cut}$ and $L_{\rm iso}$ may opens a new avenue for diagnostics of the physics of the particle acceleration and radiation in a variety of astrophysical sources.</description>

      <title>Flares from plasmoids and current sheets around Sgr A$^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supermassive black hole Sgr A$^*$ at the center of our galaxy produces repeating near-infrared flares that are observed by ground and space based instruments. This activity has been simulated in the past with Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) models which include stable jet formations. The present study uses a different approach in that it considers a Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) multi-loop model that lacks a stable jet structure. The main objective of this research is to identify regions that contain current sheets and high magnetic turbulence, and to subsequently generate a 2.2 micron light curve generated from non-thermal particles. Additionally, we investigate the properties of the flares, in particular, their evolution during flare events, and the similarity of flare characteristics between the generated and observed light curves. 2D GRMHD simulation data from a SANE multi-loop model is employed, and thermal radiation is introduced to generate a 230 GHz light curve. Physical variables are calibrated to align with the 230 GHz observations. Current sheets are identified by analyzing toroidal currents, magnetization, plasma beta, density, and dimensionless temperatures. The evolution of current sheets during flare events is studied, and higher-energy non-thermal light curves are calculated, focusing on the 2.2 micron near-infrared range. We obtain promising 2.2 micron lightcurves whose flare duration and spectral index behavior align well with observations. Our findings support the association of flares with particle acceleration and nonthermal emission in current sheet plasmoid chains and in the boundary of the disk inside the funnel above and below the central black hole.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-driven Core-collapse Supernova Yields in Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide yields from 189 neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations covering zero-age main sequence masses between 11 and 75 solar masses and three different metallicities. Our CCSN simulations have two main advantages compared to previous methods used for applications in Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Firstly, the mass cut between remnant and ejecta evolves naturally. Secondly, the neutrino luminosities and thus the electron fraction are not modified. Both is key to obtain an accurate nucleosynthesis. We follow the composition with an in-situ nuclear reaction network including the 16 most abundant isotopes and use the yields as input in a GCE model of the Milky Way. We adopt a GCE which takes into account infall of gas as well as nucleosynthesis from a large variety of stellar sources. The GCE model is calibrated to reproduce the main features of the solar vicinity. For the CCSN models, we use different calibrations and propagate the uncertainty. We find a big impact of the CCSN yields on our GCE predictions. We compare the abundance ratios of C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Ti, and Cr with respect to Fe to an observational data set as homogeneous as possible. From this, we conclude that at least half of the massive stars have to explode to match the observed abundance ratios. If the explosions are too energetic, the high amount of iron will suppress the abundance ratios. With this, we demonstrate how GCE models can be used to constrain the evolution and deaths of massive stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of general relativity (GR) is the standard framework for the description of gravitation and the geometric structure of spacetime. With the recent advancement of observational instruments, it has become possible to probe the strong field regime to test GR. We present the constraints obtained from the binary black hole inspiral data of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) observations on the deformations of some popular parametrized non-Kerr metrics.</description>

      <title>Can light-rings self-gravitate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a spherically symmetric and static spacetime of a compact object, such as that of a Schwarzschild black hole, the light-ring is a 2-sphere where photons experience the only possible circular orbits. As a "Gedankenexperiment", we imagine an advanced civilisation able to populate the light-ring of a nonrotating black hole of mass $M$ with photons having a fine-tuned impact parameter that allows their orbits to be exactly circular with radius $r=3M$. As the number of photons in the light-ring increases in time, its mass will no longer be negligible and hence it will impact on the background spacetime, that is, it will "self-gravitate". We here consider two different routes to assign a nonzero mass to the light-ring that are either based on a discrete concentration of photons on a specific radial location or on a suitable distribution of photons in a given region. In both cases, and using the Einstein equations, we find that the inclusion of the energy from the accumulated photons leads to the generation of new light-rings. Such new light-rings can either appear at well-defined but discrete locations, or be fused in a well-defined region. In either case, we show that such light-ring configurations are dynamically unstable and a small perturbation, either via the inclusion of an additional photon onto the light-ring or via the absorption of a photon by the black hole, leads to a catastrophic destruction of the light-ring structures.</description>

      <title>SpIRIT Mission: In-Orbit Results and Technology Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Space Industry Responsive Intelligent Thermal (SpIRIT) 6U CubeSat is a mission led by The University of Melbourne in cooperation with the Italian Space Agency. Launched in a 510 km Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit in December 2023, SpIRIT carries multiple subsystems for scientific and technology demonstration. The main payload is the HERMES instrument for detection of high-energy astrophysics transients (Gamma Ray Bursts), and for studies of their variability at scales below 1 ms. The satellite includes a novel thermal management system for its class, based on a Stirling-cycle cooler and deployable thermal radiator, designed to cool HERMES to reduce instrumental background noise. A low-latency communication subsystem based on a sat-phone network is supporting rapid transmission of time-critical data and telecommands. SpIRIT is also equipped with a set of RGB and thermal IR cameras, connected to an on-board image processing unit with artificial intelligence capabilities for autonomous feature recognition. To effectively manage all interfaces between different subsystems and mission stakeholders, the University of Melbourne developed an instrument control unit (PMS) which operates all payloads. PMS also provides backup uninterruptible power to the HERMES instrument through a supercapacitor-based UPS for safe instrument shutdown in case of platform power interruptions. This paper first presents a mission and payload overview, and early in-orbit results, along with lessons learned throughout the mission. This work not only sheds light on the novelty of some of the on-board technologies onboard and on their potential impact to enable greater utilization of CubeSats for scientific missions, but also offers insights into the practical challenges and accomplishments related to developing and operating a multi-organization CubeSat with a complex array of instruments and systems.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Massive Black Hole Merger Host Galaxies from Cosmological Simulations II: Unique Stellar Kinematics in Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational wave experiments such as LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently in Bardati et al. (2024, Paper I), we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral datacubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (&gt;10^8.2 Msun) and high mass ratios (&gt;0.5), the accuracies reach &gt;85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array sensitivity to anisotropies in the gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations have recently gathered substantial evidence for the existence of a gravitational wave background in the nHz frequency band. Searching for anisotropies in this signal is key to determining its origin, and in particular to distinguish possible astrophysical from cosmological sources. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of current and future pulsar timing arrays to such anisotropies using the full covariance matrix of pulsar timing delays. While current day pulsar timing arrays can only set mildly informative constraints on the dipole and quadrupole, we show that percent level accuracy for several low multipoles can be achieved in the near future. Moreover, we demonstrate that anisotropies in the gravitational wave background and the Hellings-Downs angular correlation, indicating the presence of GWs, are approximately uncorrelated, and can hence be reconstructed independently. These results can be reproduced with \href{https://github.com/Mauropieroni/fastPTA}{\texttt{fastPTA}}, a publicly available Python code to forecast the constraining power of PTA configurations.</description>

      <title>{\gamma}-Ray and ultra-high energy neutrino background suppression due to solar radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03807v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sun emits copious amounts of photons and neutrinos in an approximately spatially isotropic distribution. Diffuse $\gamma$-rays and ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos from extragalactic sources may subsequently interact and annihilate with the emitted solar photons and neutrinos respectively. This will in turn induce an anisotropy in the cosmic ray (CR) background due to attenuation of the $\gamma$-ray and UHE neutrino flux by the solar radiation. Measuring this reduction, therefore, presents a simple and powerful astrophysical probe of electroweak interactions. In this letter we compute such anisotropies for TeV $\gamma$-rays, which at the Earth (Sun) can be at least $\simeq 10^{-4},(10^{-2})$. The optical depth at Earth for elongation angles more focused around the Sun ($\lesssim 10^\circ$), can be around $10^{-3}$ and larger. Neutrino attenuation is extremely tiny for for PeV scale UHE neutrinos. We briefly discuss observational prospects for experiments such as the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT), High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) detector, The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and IceCube. The potential for measuring $\gamma$-ray attenuation at orbital locations of other active satellites such as the Parker Solar Probe and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is also explored.</description>

Abstract: Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) are neutron stars that emit sporadic radio bursts. We detected 1955 single pulses from RRAT J1913+1330 using the 19-beam receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). These pulses were detected in 19 distinct clusters, with 49.4% of them occurring with a waiting time of one rotation period. The energy distribution of these individual pulses exhibited a wide range, spanning three orders of magnitude, reminiscent of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Furthermore, we observed abrupt variations in pulse profile, width, peak flux, and fluence between adjacent sequential pulses. These findings suggest that this RRAT could be interpreted as a pulsar with extreme pulse-to-pulse modulation. The presence of sequential pulse trains during active phases, along with significant pulse variations in profile, fluence, flux, and width, should be intrinsic to a subset of RRATs. Our results indicate that J1913+1330 represents a peculiar source that shares certain properties with populations of nulling pulsars, giant pulses, and FRBs from different perspectives. The dramatic pulse-to-pulse variation observed in J1913+1330 could be attributed to unstable pair creation above the polar cap region and the variation of the site where streaming pairs emit coherently. Exploring a larger sample of RRATs exhibiting similar properties to J1913+1330 has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of pulsars, RRATs, and FRBs.</description>

      <title>Neutrino signal from a population of Seyfert galaxies</title>

Abstract: IceCube collaboration has previously reported an evidence for neutrino signal from a Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. This may suggest that all Seyfert galaxies emit neutrinos. To test this hypothesis, we identify the best candidate neutrino sources among nearby Seyfert galaxies, based on their hard X-ray properties. Only two other sources, NGC 4151 and NGC 3079 are expected to be detectable in 10 years of IceCube data. We find an evidence (~3 sigma)} for neutrino signal from both sources in publicly available ten-year IceCube dataset. {Though neither source alone is above the threshold for discovery,} the chance coincidence probability to find the observed neutrino count excesses in the directions of the two out of two expected sources, in addition to the previously reported brightest source, is p&lt;2.6e-7. This corresponds to a correlation between Seyfert galaxies and neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the MRI driven dynamo in a stratified shearing box</title>

Abstract: We study the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) driven dynamo in a geometrically thin disc ($H/R\ll 1$) using stratified zero net flux (ZNF) shearing box simulations. We find that mean fields and EMFs oscillate with a primary frequency $f_{\rm dyn} = 0.017$ ($\approx 9$ orbital period), but also have higher harmonics at $3f_{\rm dyn}$. Correspondingly, the current helicity, has two frequencies $2f_{\rm dyn}$ and $4f_{\rm dyn}$ respectively, which appear to be the beat frequencies of mean fields and EMFs as expected from the magnetic helicity density evolution equation. Further, we adopt a novel inversion algorithm called the `Iterative Removal Of Sources' (IROS), to extract the turbulent dynamo coefficients in the mean-field closure using the mean magnetic fields and EMFs obtained from the shearing box simulation. We show that an $\alpha-$effect ($\alpha_{yy}$) is predominantly responsible for the creation of the poloidal field from the toroidal field, while shear generates back a toroidal field from the poloidal field; indicating that an $\alpha-\Omega$-type dynamo is operative in MRI-driven accretion discs. We also find that both strong outflow ($\bar{v}_z$) and turbulent pumping ($\gamma_z$ ) transport mean fields away from the mid-plane. Instead of turbulent diffusivity, they are the principal sink terms in the mean magnetic energy evolution equation. We find encouraging evidence that a generative helicity flux is responsible for the effective $\alpha$-effect. Finally, we point out potential limitations of horizontal ($x-y$) averaging in defining the `mean' on the extraction of dynamo coefficients and their physical interpretations.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from the surroundings of these pulsars. We used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTAO, which is now under development. Furthermore, the particle propagation throughout the Galaxy was simulated using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. The findings suggest that CTAO may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

Abstract: Interactions of cosmic ray protons and nuclei in their sources and in the interstellar medium produce "hadronic" gamma-ray emission. Gamma-rays can also be of "leptonic" origin, i.e. originating from high-energy electrons accelerated together with protons. It is difficult to distinguish between hadronic and leptonic emission mechanisms based on gamma-ray data alone. This can be done via detection of neutrinos, because only hadronic processes lead to neutrino production. We use publicly available ten-year IceCube neutrino telescope dataset to demonstrate the hadronic nature of high-energy emission from the direction of Cygnus region of the Milky Way. We find a 3-sigma excess of neutrino events from an extended Cygnus Cocoon, with the flux comparable to the flux of gamma-rays in the multi-TeV energy range seen by HAWC and LHAASO telescopes.</description>

      <title>The Northern Cross Fast Radio Burst project IV. Multi-wavelength study of the actively repeating FRB 20220912A</title>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are energetic, millisecond-duration radio pulses observed at extragalactic distances and whose origins are still a subject of heated debate. A fraction of the FRB population have shown repeating bursts, however it's still unclear whether these represent a distinct class of sources. We investigated the bursting behaviour of FRB 20220912A, one of the most active repeating FRBs known thus far. In particular, we focused on its burst energy distribution, linked to the source energetics, and its emission spectrum, with the latter directly related to the underlying emission mechanism. We monitored FRB 20220912A at $408$ MHz with the Northern Cross radio telescope and at $1.4$ GHz using the $32$-m Medicina Grueff radio telescope. Additionally, we conducted $1.2$ GHz observations taken with the upgraded Giant Meter Wave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) searching for a persistent radio source coincident with FRB 20220912A, which included high energy observations in the $0.3-10$ keV, $0.4-100$ MeV and $0.03-30$ GeV energy range. We report $16$ new bursts from FRB 20220912A at $408$ MHz during the period between October 16$^{\rm th}$ 2022 and December 31$^{\rm st}$ 2023. Their cumulative spectral energy distribution follows a power law with slope $\alpha_E = -1.3 \pm 0.2$ and we measured a repetition rate of $0.19 \pm 0.03$ hr$^{-1}$ for bursts having a fluence of $\mathcal{F} \geq 17$ Jy ms. Furthermore, we report no detections at 1.4 GHz for $\mathcal{F} \geq 20$ Jy ms. These non-detections imply an upper limit of $\beta &lt; -2.3$, with $\beta$ being the $408$ MHz $-$ $1.4$ GHz spectral index of FRB 20220912A. This is inconsistent with positive $\beta$ values found for the only two known cases in which an FRB has been detected in separate spectral bands. We find that FRB 20220912A shows a decline of four orders of magnitude in its bursting activity at $1.4$ GHz over a .. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Ticking away: the long-term X-ray timing and spectral evolution of eRO-QPE2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeated X-ray flares from galactic nuclei. Despite some diversity in the recurrence and amplitude of eruptions, their striking regularity has motivated theorists to associate QPEs with orbital systems. Among the known QPE sources, eRO-QPE2 has shown the most regular flare timing and luminosity since its discovery. We report here on its long-term evolution over $\sim3.3\,$yr from discovery and find that: i) the average QPE recurrence time per epoch has decreased over time, albeit not at a uniform rate; ii) the distinct alternation between consecutive long and short recurrence times found at discovery has not been significant since; iii) the spectral properties, namely flux and temperature of both eruptions and quiescence components, have remained remarkably consistent within uncertainties. We attempted to interpret these results as orbital period and eccentricity decay coupled with orbital and disk precession. However, since gaps between observations are too long, we are not able to distinguish between an evolution dominated by just a decreasing trend, or by large modulations (e.g. due to the precession frequencies at play). In the former case, the observed period decrease is roughly consistent with that of a star losing orbital energy due to hydrodynamic gas drag from disk collisions, although the related eccentricity decay is too fast and additional modulations have to contribute too. In the latter case, no conclusive remarks are possible on the orbital evolution and the nature of the orbiter due to the many effects at play. However, these two cases come with distinctive predictions for future X-ray data: in the former, we expect all future observations to show a shorter recurrence time than the latest epoch, while in the latter we expect some future observations to be found with a larger recurrence, hence an apparent temporary period increase.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying transients suitable for both strong signal-dominated and background-dominated objects. By employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as Expectation Maximization, we achieve computing time reductions of over $10^4$ on a single CPU compared to conventional brute-force methods. Furthermore, this approach can be readily extended to analyze multiple flares. We illustrate the algorithm's application by fitting the IceCube neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmic-ray boosted dark matter with realistic cross section</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-MeV cold dark-matter particles are unable to produce electronic recoil in conventional dark-matter direct detection experiments such as XENONnT and LUX-ZEPLIN above the detector threshold. The mechanism of boosted dark matter comes into picture to constrain the parameter space of such low mass dark matter from direct detection experiments. We consider the effect of the leading components of cosmic rays to boost the cold dark matter, which results in significant improvements on the exclusion limits compared to the existing ones. To present concrete study results, we choose to work on models consisting of a dark-matter particle $\chi$ with an additional $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry including the secluded dark photon, $U(1)_{B-L}$, and $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$. We find that the energy dependence of the scattering cross section plays a crucial role in improving the constraints. In addition, we systematically estimate the Earth shielding effect on boosted dark matter in losing energy while traveling to the underground detector through the Earth.</description>

      <title>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</description>
