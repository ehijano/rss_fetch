      <title>Finiteness of semibricks and brick-finite algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite-dimensional algebra {\Lambda}, we establish an explicit bijection between widely generated torsion(-free) classes and semibricks in mod {\Lambda}. Using the kappa order on the lattice of torsion classes with canonical join representations, we provide several equivalent conditions for brick-finite algebras. We show that {\Lambda} is brick-finite if and only if any chain of wide subcategories of mod {\Lambda} becomes eventually constant, if and only if any torsion class in mod {\Lambda} has finitely many covers, if and only if every semibrick in mod {\Lambda} is a finite set. Thus, we give a proof of Enomoto's conjecture (Adv. Math., 393 (2021), 108113). As a consequence, we show that {\Lambda} is brick-finite if and only if every wide subcategory closed under coproducts of Mod {\Lambda} is closed under products, if and only if every wide subcategory of mod {\Lambda} is functorially finite. This gives a positive answer to the question posed by Angeleri H\"ugel and Sentieri (J. Algebra, 664 (2025), 164-205).</description>

      <title>Distinguished representations for $\rm{SL}(n,F)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite field, and let $\mathbb{E}$ be either a quadratic field extension $E/F$ or the split algebra $F \oplus F$. We study distinguished representations of $\rm{SL}_{2n}(F)$ by the subgroup $H_{\flat} := \rm{SL}_{2n}(F) \cap \rm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{E})$, which is a variation of the work of Anandavardhanan and Prasad on distinguished representations of $\rm{SL}_{n}(\mathbb{E})$ by the subgroup $\rm{SL}_n(F)$. This is in a similar framework of our earlier work of a $p$-adic non-split variation of Anandavardhanan-Prasad over finite fields. We give a formula for the dimension of the complex vector space $\rm{Hom}_{H_{\flat}}(\pi_{\flat}, 1)$ in terms of certain characters of $F^{\times}$, where $\pi_{\flat}$ is an irreducible representation which is also distinguished by $H_{\flat}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that under a mild condition, a multiset of tagged permissible arcs over a skew-tiling is uniquely determined by its intersection vector. As an application, it is proved that -- up to isomorphism -- different $\tau$-rigid modules over a skew-gentle algebra $A$ arising from a skew-triple $(Q,Sp,I)$ have different dimension vectors if and only if $(Q,I)$ has no minimal oriented cycle of even-length with full zero relations. This generalizes a recent work of Fu-Geng for gentle algebras.</description>

      <title>The Green ring of a restricted enveloping algebra in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Bbbk$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$ and let $\mathfrak{fsl}(2)$ be the unique, up to isomorphism, $3$-dimensional simple Lie algebra over $\Bbbk$. Denote by $\mathfrak{m}$ the minimal $2$-envelope of $\mathfrak{fsl}(2)$ and by $\mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{m})$ its corresponding restricted enveloping algebra. The non-isomorphic finite-dimensional indecomposable $\mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{m})$-modules were classified in \cite{ABDF}. In this paper, the Green ring (or representation ring) for $\mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{m})$ is calculated. Also, the semisimplification of the representation category of $\mathfrak{u}(\mathfrak{m})$ is determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Lie conformal algebroids (LCAd) and their representations using the language of lambda-brackets and Lie conformal algebras. We describe several general constructions, such as the LCAd of conformal derivations CDer(A) of a differential algebra A, the gauge LCAd G(A,M) associated to a differential algebra A and its module M, the current LCAd F^ of a Lie algebroid F, and the LCAd structure of the space Omega(V) of Kahler differentials over a Poisson vertex algebra (PVA) V. We develop the cohomology theories of LCAd and we relate them to the corresponding cohomology theories of PVA. In particular, we find an isomorphism between the cohomology of a PVA V with coefficients in a module M and the corresponding cohomology of the LCAd Omega(V) with coefficients in the same module.</description>

      <title>Leading terms of relations on a level 5 module over the twisted affine Lie algebra $A_2^{(2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5\Lambda_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5\Lambda_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2\Lambda_0)$.</description>

      <title>Classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over full toroidal Lie algebras and higher-dimensional Virasoro algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify the irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over the full toroidal Lie algebra, which is a natural higher-dimensional analogue of the affine-Virasoro algebra. In particular, we complete the classification of irreducible bounded modules, which were studied by Billig for non-zero level modules [Int. Math. Res. Not. 2006]. As a by-product, we also obtain the classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over the higher-dimensional Virasoro algebra, which was introduced by Rao-Moody [Comm. Math. Phys. 1994], thereby generalizing the well-known result of O. Mathieu [Invent. Math. 1992] for the classical Virasoro algebra. More precisely, we show that any irreducible Harish-Chandra module over the higher-dimensional Virasoro algebra turns out to be either a quotient of a module of tensor fields on a torus or a highest weight type module up to a twist of an automorphism, as conjectured by Eswara Rao in 2004.</description>

      <title>Quasi-finite modules over affine and extended affine Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider irreducible quasi-finite (or equivalently weakly integrable) modules, with non-trivial action of the core, over the extended affine Lie algebras (EALAs) whose centerless cores are multiloop algebras. The centerless cores of all but one family of EALAs having nullity greater than 1 are known to admit such multiloop realizations. For any such (untwisted) EALA, we show that the irreducible quasi-finite modules are either integrable with the center of the underlying core acting trivially, or restricted generalized highest weight (GHW) modules. We further prove that in the nullity 2 case, these irreducible restricted GHW modules turn out to be highest weight type modules, thereby classifying the irreducible quasi-finite modules over all such EALAs. In particular, we obtain the classification of irreducible quasi-finite modules over toroidal Lie algebras, minimal EALAs and toroidal EALAs of nullity 2. Along the way, we completely classify the irreducible weakly integrable modules over affine Kac-Moody algebras (studied by Rao-Futorny [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2009] for non-zero level modules). Our results generalize the well-known work of Chari [Invent. Math. 1986] and Chari-Pressley [Math. Ann. 1986] concerning the classification of irreducible integrable modules over (nullity 1) affine Kac-Moody algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following arXiv:0909.5586 and arXiv:1411.4125, we construct two super-extensions of the usual tensor algebra through the super-actions of symmetric groups and Hecke algebras respectively. For each extension, we consider a special type of derivations coming from covectors, and study the the space generated, in some special manner, by these derivations and operators from left multiplication by vectors and permutations. Duality theorems of these spaces and the super-actions are proved. As an application, we provide a new proof of the Schur-Sergeev duality theorem, as well as its quantum version.</description>

      <title>Tensor K-matrices for quantum symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra, $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ its quantum group, and $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \subset U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ a quantum symmetric pair subalgebra determined by a Lie algebra automorphism $\theta$. We introduce a category $W_\theta$ of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules, which is acted on by the category of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules via tensor products. We construct a universal tensor K-matrix $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, a solution of a reflection equation) in a completion of $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \otimes U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. This yields a natural operator on any tensor product $M \otimes V$, where $M\in W_\theta$ and $V\in {O}_\theta$, that is $V$ is a $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module in category ${O}$ satisfying an integrability property determined by $\theta$. Canonically, $W_\theta$ is equipped with a structure of a bimodule category over ${O}_\theta$ and the action of $\mathbb{K}$ is encoded by a new categorical structure, which we call a boundary structure on $W_\theta$. This generalizes a result of Kolb which describes a braided module structure on finite-dimensional $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite-dimensional. We also consider our construction in the case of the category ${C}$ of finite-dimensional modules over a quantum affine algebra, providing the most comprehensive universal framework to date for large families of solutions of parameter-dependent reflection equations. In this case the tensor K-matrix gives rise to a formal Laurent series with a well-defined action on tensor products of any module in $W_\theta$ and any module in ${C}$. This series can be normalized to an operator-valued rational function, which we call trigonometric tensor K-matrix, if both factors in the tensor product are in ${C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a record of the lecture at the centennial conference for Harish-Chandra. The admissibility theorem of Harish-Chandra concerns the restrictions of irreducible representations to maximal compact subgroups. In this article, we begin with a brief explanation of two directions for generalizing his pioneering work to {\it{non-compact}} reductive subgroups: one emphasizes discrete decomposability with the finite multiplicity property, while the other focuses on finite/uniformly bounded multiplicity properties. We discuss how the recent representation-theoretic developments in these directions collectively offer a powerful method for the new spectral analysis of standard locally symmetric spaces, extending beyond the classical Riemannian setting.</description>

      <title>How does the restriction of representations change under translations? A story for the general linear groups and the unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to symmetry breaking for pairs of real forms of $(GL(n, \mathbb{C}), GL(n-1, \mathbb{C}))$. Translation functors are powerful tools for studying families of representations of a single reductive group $G$. However, when applied to a pair of groups $G \supset G'$, they can significantly alter the nature of symmetry breaking between the representations of $G$ and $G'$, even within the same Weyl chamber of the direct product group $G \times G'$.
  We introduce the concept of "fences for the interleaving pattern", which provides a refinement of the usual notion of walls of Weyl chambers. We then establish a theorem stating that the multiplicity remains constant unless these "fences" are crossed, together with a new general vanishing theorem for symmetry breaking.
  These general results are illustrated with examples involving both tempered and non-tempered representations. In addition, we present a new non-vanishing theorem for period integrals for pairs of reductive symmetric spaces, which is further strengthened by this approach.</description>

Abstract: Jensen, Su, and Yang described the projective indecomposable modules of the $0$-Schur algebra $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ using its geometric realization. In this paper, the simple modules of $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ are identified by computing the tops of the projective indecomposable modules. Furthermore, functorial relations among the module categories $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$\textsf{-mod}, $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$\textsf{-mod}, and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$\textsf{-mod} are examined, where $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$ denotes the $0$-Hecke algebra and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ denotes the degenerate quantum group.</description>

      <title>Parabolic subgroups of complex braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a class of `parabolic' subgroups for the generalized braid group associated to an arbitrary irreducible complex reflection group, which maps onto the collection of parabolic subgroups of the reflection group. Except for one case, which is proven separately elsewhere, we prove that this collection forms a lattice, so that intersections of parabolic subgroups are parabolic subgroups. In particular, every element admits a parabolic closure, which is the smallest parabolic subgroup containing it. We furthermore prove that it provides a simplicial complex which generalizes the curve complex of the usual braid group. In the case of real reflection groups, this complex generalizes the one previously introduced by Cumplido, Gebhardt, Gonz\'alez-Meneses and Wiest for Artin groups of spherical type. We show that it shares similar properties, and similarly conjecture its hyperbolicity, with a few additional results in this direction.</description>

Abstract: For a connected, reductive group $G$ over a finite field endowed with a cocharacter $\mu$, we define the zip cone of $(G,\mu)$ as the cone of all possible weights of mod $p$ automorphic forms on the stack of $G$-zips. This cone is conjectured to coincide with the cone of weights of characteristic $p$ automorphic forms for Hodge-type Shimura varieties of good reduction. We prove in full generality that the cone of weights of characteristic $0$ automorphic forms is contained in the zip cone, which gives further evidence to this conjecture. Furthermore, we determine exactly when the zip cone is generated by the weights of partial Hasse invariants, which is a group-theoretical generalization of a result of Diamond--Kassaei and Goldring--Koskivirta.</description>

      <title>Lyndon bases of split $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study Lyndon bases of split $\imath$quantum groups $\mathbf{U}^\imath(\mathfrak{g})$. A relationship between the Lyndon bases and PBW-type bases was provided. As an application, we establish the existence of canonical bases for the type A split $\imath$quantum groups $\mathbf{U}^\imath(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-rigid random quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum graph $\mathcal{G}$ housed by a matrix algebra $M_n$ can be encoded as an operator system $\mathcal S=\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{G}}\le M_n$. There are two sensible notions of quantum automorphism group for any such: $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal G)$, capturing the quantum symmetries of the adjacency matrix $A:M_n\to M_n$ attached to $\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal S\le M_n)$, the quantum group acting universally on $M_n$ so as to preserve its $C^*$ structure, standard trace, and subspace $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$. The two quantum groups coincide classically, but diverge in general. We nevertheless show that both are generically trivial in the sense that they are so for $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$ ranging over a non-empty Zariski-open set under all reasonable dimensional constraints on $\dim \mathcal{S}$ and $n$.
  This extends analogous prior results by the first and third authors to the effect that classical symmetry groups of still-quantum graphs are generically trivial, and offers a fully quantum counterpart to the familiar probabilistic almost-rigidity of finite graphs. An auxiliary result sheds some light on the relationship between the two notions of quantum automorphism group, identifying the universal preserver of the quantum adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ with the quantum automorphism group not of $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$, but rather of the complex conjugate $\overline{\mathcal{S}}\le M_n$.</description>

      <title>A dodecic surface with 320 cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a degree $12$ homogeneous invariant of the complex reflection group $G_{29}$ (in Shephard-Todd's notation) whose associated surface has 320 singularities of type $A_2$, improving previous records for dodecic surfaces.</description>
