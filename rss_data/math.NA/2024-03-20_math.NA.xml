      <title>A note on incomplete Cholesky factorizations in half precision arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incomplete factorizations have long been popular general-purpose algebraic preconditioners for solving large sparse linear systems of equations. Guaranteeing the factorization is breakdown free while computing a high quality preconditioner is challenging. A resurgence of interest in using low precision arithmetic makes the search for robustness more urgent and tougher. In this paper, we focus on symmetric positive definite problems and explore a number of approaches: a look-ahead strategy to anticipate break down as early as possible, the use of global shifts, and a modification of an idea developed in the field of numerical optimization for the complete Cholesky factorization of dense matrices. Our numerical simulations target highly ill-conditioned sparse linear systems with the goal of computing the factors in half precision arithmetic and then achieving double precision accuracy using mixed precision refinement.</description>

      <title>The Johnson-Mercier elasticity element in any dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed methods for linear elasticity with strongly symmetric stresses of lowest order are studied in this paper. On each simplex, the stress space has piecewise linear components with respect to its Alfeld split (which connects the vertices to barycenter), generalizing the Johnson-Mercier two-dimensional element to higher dimensions. Further reductions in the stress space in the three-dimensional case (to 24 degrees of freedom per tetrahedron) are possible when the displacement space is reduced to local rigid displacements. Proofs of optimal error estimates of numerical solutions and improved error estimates via postprocessing and the duality argument are presented.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Point Estimate Method for Probabilistic Moments Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents in detail the originally developed Quadratic Point Estimate Method (QPEM), aimed at efficiently and accurately computing the first four output moments of probabilistic distributions, using 2n^2+1 sample (or sigma) points, with n, the number of input random variables. The proposed QPEM particularly offers an effective, superior, and practical alternative to existing sampling and quadrature methods for low- and moderately-high-dimensional problems. Detailed theoretical derivations are provided proving that the proposed method can achieve a fifth or higher-order accuracy for symmetric input distributions. Various numerical examples, from simple polynomial functions to nonlinear finite element analyses with random field representations, support the theoretical findings and further showcase the validity, efficiency, and applicability of the QPEM, from low- to high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Fourth-order entropy-stable lattice Boltzmann schemes for hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for the development of fourth-order lattice Boltzmann schemes to tackle multidimensional nonlinear systems of conservation laws. Our numerical schemes preserve two fundamental characteristics inherent in classical lattice Boltzmann methods: a local relaxation phase and a transport phase composed of elementary shifts on a Cartesian grid. Achieving fourth-order accuracy is accomplished through the composition of second-order time-symmetric basic schemes utilizing rational weights. This enables the representation of the transport phase in terms of elementary shifts. Introducing local variations in the relaxation parameter during each stage of relaxation ensures the entropic nature of the schemes. This not only enhances stability in the long-time limit but also maintains fourth-order accuracy. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive testing on scalar equations and systems in both one and two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bound-Preserving Framework for Central-Upwind Schemes for General Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central-upwind (CU) schemes are Riemann-problem-solver-free finite-volume methods widely applied to a variety of hyperbolic systems of PDEs. Exact solutions of these systems typically satisfy certain bounds, and it is highly desirable or even crucial for the numerical schemes to preserve these bounds. In this paper, we develop and analyze bound-preserving (BP) CU schemes for general hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Unlike many other Godunov-type methods, CU schemes cannot, in general, be recast as convex combinations of first-order BP schemes. Consequently, standard BP analysis techniques are invalidated. We address these challenges by establishing a novel framework for analyzing the BP property of CU schemes. To this end, we discover that the CU schemes can be decomposed as a convex combination of several intermediate solution states. Thanks to this key finding, the goal of designing BPCU schemes is simplified to the enforcement of four more accessible BP conditions, each of which can be achieved with the help of a minor modification of the CU schemes. We employ the proposed approach to construct provably BPCU schemes for the Euler equations of gas dynamics. The robustness and effectiveness of the BPCU schemes are validated by several demanding numerical examples, including high-speed jet problems, flow past a forward-facing step, and a shock diffraction problem.</description>

      <title>Adaptive time step selection for Spectral Deferred Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral Deferred Corrections (SDC) is an iterative method for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. It works by refining the numerical solution for an initial value problem by approximately solving differential equations for the error, and can be interpreted as a preconditioned fixed-point iteration for solving the fully implicit collocation problem. We adopt techniques from embedded Runge-Kutta Methods (RKM) to SDC in order to provide a mechanism for adaptive time step size selection and thus increase computational efficiency of SDC. We propose two SDC-specific estimates of the local error that are generic and require only minimal problem specific tuning. We demonstrate a gain in efficiency over standard SDC with fixed step size, compare efficiency favorably against state-of-the-art adaptive RKM and show that due to its iterative nature, adaptive SDC can cope efficiently with silent data corruption.</description>

      <title>Antithetic Multilevel Methods for Elliptic and Hypo-Elliptic Diffusions with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for the estimation of expectations with respect to laws of diffusion processes that can be elliptic or hypo-elliptic. In particular, we consider the case where one has to resort to time discretization of the diffusion and numerical simulation of such schemes. Motivated by recent developments, we introduce a new MLMC estimator of expectations, which does not require simulation of intractable L\'evy areas but has a weak error of order 2 and achieves the optimal computational complexity. We then show how this approach can be used in the context of the filtering problem associated to partially observed diffusions with discrete time observations. We illustrate with numerical simulations that our new approaches provide efficiency gains for several problems relative to some existing methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for the Maxey-Riley equations with Basset history term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maxey-Riley equations (MRE) describe the motion of a finite-sized, spherical particle in a fluid. Because of wake effects, the force acting on a particle depends on its past trajectory. This is modelled by an integral term in the MRE, also called Basset force, that makes its numerical solution challenging and memory intensive. A recent approach proposed by Prasath, Vasan and Govindarajan exploits connections between the integral term and fractional derivatives to reformulate the MRE as a time-dependent partial differential equation on a semi-infinite pseudo-space. They also propose a numerical algorithm based on polynomial expansions. This paper develops a numerical approach based on finite difference instead, by adopting techniques by Koleva and Fazio and Janelli to cope with the issues of having an unbounded spatial domain. We compare convergence order and computational efficiency for particles of varying size and density of the polynomial expansion by Prasath et al., our finite difference schemes and a direct integrator for the MRE based on multi-step methods proposed by Daitche.</description>

      <title>A high-fidelity material point method for frictional contact problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel Material Point Method (MPM) is introduced for addressing frictional contact problems. In contrast to the standard multi-velocity field approach, this method employs a penalty method to evaluate contact forces at the discretised boundaries of their respective physical domains. This enhances simulation fidelity by accurately considering the deformability of the contact surface, preventing fictitious gaps between bodies in contact. Additionally, the method utilises the Extended B-Splines (EBSs) domain approximation, providing two key advantages. First, EBSs robustly mitigate grid cell-crossing errors by offering continuous gradients of the basis functions on the interface between adjacent grid cells. Second, numerical integration errors are minimised, even with small physical domains in occupied grid cells. The proposed method's robustness and accuracy are evaluated through benchmarks, including comparisons with analytical solutions, other MPM-based contact algorithms, and experimental observations from the literature. Notably, the method demonstrates effective mitigation of stress errors inherent in contact simulations.</description>

      <title>A variationally consistent membrane wrinkling model based on tension-compression decomposition of the strain tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel variationally consistent membrane wrinkling model for analyzing the mechanical responses of wrinkled thin membranes. The elastic strain energy density is split into tensile and compressive terms via a spectral decomposition of the strain tensor. Tensile and compressive parts of the stress and tangent material matrices are then obtained via consistent variation from the respective strain energies. Considering only the positive part of the strain energy in the variational formulation, we obtain a membrane with zero compressive stiffness. By adding the negative strain energy multiplied with a reduction factor, we further obtain a residual compressive stiffness, which improves stability and allows handling also states of slackening. Comparison with results from analytical, numerical and experimental examples from the literature on membrane wrinkling problems demonstrate the great performance and capability of the proposed approach, which is also compatible with commercial finite element software.</description>

      <title>A convergent adaptive finite element stochastic Galerkin method based on multilevel expansions of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject of this work is an adaptive stochastic Galerkin finite element method for parametric or random elliptic partial differential equations, which generates sparse product polynomial expansions with respect to the parametric variables of solutions. For the corresponding spatial approximations, an independently refined finite element mesh is used for each polynomial coefficient. The method relies on multilevel expansions of input random fields and achieves error reduction with uniform rate. In particular, the saturation property for the refinement process is ensured by the algorithm. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments, including cases with random fields of low regularity.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity surrogate with heterogeneous input spaces for modeling melt pools in laser-directed energy deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-fidelity (MF) modeling is a powerful statistical approach that can intelligently blend data from varied fidelity sources. This approach finds a compelling application in predicting melt pool geometry for laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED). One major challenge in using MF surrogates to merge a hierarchy of melt pool models is the variability in input spaces. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach for constructing an MF surrogate for predicting melt pool geometry by integrating models of varying complexity, that operate on heterogeneous input spaces. The first thermal model incorporates five input parameters i.e., laser power, scan velocity, powder flow rate, carrier gas flow rate, and nozzle height. In contrast, the second thermal model can only handle laser power and scan velocity. A mapping is established between the heterogeneous input spaces so that the five-dimensional space can be morphed into a pseudo two-dimensional space. Predictions are then blended using a Gaussian process-based co-kriging method. The resulting heterogeneous multi-fidelity Gaussian process (Het-MFGP) surrogate not only improves predictive accuracy but also offers computational efficiency by reducing evaluations required from the high-dimensional, high-fidelity thermal model. The results underscore the benefits of employing Het-MFGP for modeling melt pool behavior in L-DED. The framework successfully demonstrates how to leverage multimodal data and handle scenarios where certain input parameters may be difficult to model or measure.</description>

      <title>From primary HPV infection to carcinoma in situ: a mathematical approach of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the development of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix, caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Although in most of the cases it is resolved by the immune system, a small percentage of people might develop a more serious CIN which, if left untreated, can develop into cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally, for which the World Health Organization (WHO) recently adopted the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination by 2030. With this research topic being more imperative than ever, in this paper, we develop a nonlinear mathematical model describing the CIN progression. The model consists of partial differential equations describing the dynamics of epithelial, dysplastic and immune cells, as well as the dynamics of viral particles. We use our model to explore numerically three important factors of dysplasia progression, namely the geometry of the cervix, the strength of the immune response and the frequency of viral exposure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bj\"orling problem amounts to the construction of a minimal surface from a real-analytic curve with a given real-analytic normal vector field. We approximate that solution locally by discrete minimal surfaces as special discrete isothermic surfaces (as defined by Bobenko and Pinkall in 1996). The main step in our construction is the approximation of the sought surface's Weierstrass data by discrete conformal maps. We prove that the approximation error is of the order of the square of the mesh size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Adam optimizer, often used in Machine Learning for neural network training, corresponds to an underlying ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the limit of very small learning rates. This work shows that the classical Adam algorithm is a first order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Euler discretization of the underlying ODE. Employing the time discretization point of view, we propose new extensions of the Adam scheme obtained by using higher order IMEX methods to solve the ODE. Based on this approach, we derive a new optimization algorithm for neural network training that performs better than classical Adam on several regression and classification problems.</description>

      <title>Sparse Implementation of Versatile Graph-Informed Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as effective tools for learning tasks on graph-structured data. Recently, Graph-Informed (GI) layers were introduced to address regression tasks on graph nodes, extending their applicability beyond classic GNNs. However, existing implementations of GI layers lack efficiency due to dense memory allocation. This paper presents a sparse implementation of GI layers, leveraging the sparsity of adjacency matrices to reduce memory usage significantly. Additionally, a versatile general form of GI layers is introduced, enabling their application to subsets of graph nodes. The proposed sparse implementation improves the concrete computational efficiency and scalability of the GI layers, permitting to build deeper Graph-Informed Neural Networks (GINNs) and facilitating their scalability to larger graphs.</description>

      <title>A new family of fourth-order energy-preserving integrators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Hamiltonian systems with non-canonical structure matrices, a new family of fourth-order energy-preserving integrators is presented. The integrators take a form of a combination of Runge--Kutta methods and continuous-stage Runge--Kutta methods and feature a set of free parameters that offer greater flexibility and efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that by carefully choosing these free parameters a simplified Newton iteration applied to the integrators of order four can be parallelizable. This results in faster and more efficient integrators compared with existing fourth-order energy-preserving integrators.</description>

Abstract: The increasing application of cardiorespiratory simulations for diagnosis and surgical planning necessitates the development of computational methods significantly faster than the current technology. To achieve this objective, we leverage the time-periodic nature of these flows by discretizing equations in the frequency domain instead of the time domain. This approach markedly reduces the size of the discrete problem and, consequently, the simulation cost. With this motivation, we introduce a finite element method for simulating time-periodic flows that are physically stable. The proposed time-spectral method is formulated by augmenting the baseline Galerkin's method with a least-squares penalty term that is weighed by a positive-definite stabilization matrix. An error estimate is established for the convective-diffusive system, showing that the proposed method emulates the behavior of existing standard time methods including optimal convergence rate in diffusive regimes and stability in strong convection. This method is tested on a patient-specific Fontan model at nominal Reynolds and Womersley numbers of 500 and 10, respectively, demonstrating its ability to replicate conventional time simulation results using as few as 7 modes at 11% of the computational cost. Owing to its higher local-to-processor computation density, the proposed method also exhibits improved parallel scalability for fast simulation of time-critical applications.</description>

      <title>A tight lower bound on the minimal dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new lower bound for the minimal dispersion of a point set in the unit cube and its inverse function in the high dimension regime. This is done by considering only a very small class of test boxes, which allows us to reduce bounding the dispersion to a problem in extremal set theory. Specifically, we translate a lower bound on the size of $r$-cover-free families to a lower bound on the inverse of the minimal dispersion of a point set. The lower bound we obtain matches the recently obtained upper bound on the minimal dispersion up to logarithmic terms.</description>

      <title>A finite element method for stochastic diffusion equations using fluctuating hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite element approach for diffusion problems with thermal fluctuations based on a fluctuating hydrodynamics model. The governing transport equations are stochastic partial differential equations with a fluctuating forcing term. We propose a discrete formulation of the stochastic forcing term that has the correct covariance matrix up to a standard discretization error. Furthermore, to obtain a numerical solution with spatial correlations that converge to those of the continuum equation, we derive a linear mapping to transform the finite element solution into an equivalent discrete solution that is free from the artificial correlations introduced by the spatial discretization. The method is validated by applying it to two diffusion problems: a second-order diffusion equation and a fourth-order diffusion equation. The theoretical (continuum) solution to the first case presents spatially decorrelated fluctuations, while the second case presents fluctuations correlated over a finite length. In both cases, the numerical solution presents a structure factor that approximates well the continuum one.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis on noisy quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a powerful technique for extracting complex and valuable shape-related summaries of high-dimensional data. However, the computational demands of classical algorithms for computing TDA are exorbitant, and quickly become impractical for high-order characteristics. Quantum computers offer the potential of achieving significant speedup for certain computational problems. Indeed, TDA has been purported to be one such problem, yet, quantum computing algorithms proposed for the problem, such as the original Quantum TDA (QTDA) formulation by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi, require fault-tolerance qualifications that are currently unavailable. In this study, we present NISQ-TDA, a fully implemented end-to-end quantum machine learning algorithm needing only a short circuit-depth, that is applicable to high-dimensional classical data, and with provable asymptotic speedup for certain classes of problems. The algorithm neither suffers from the data-loading problem nor does it need to store the input data on the quantum computer explicitly. The algorithm was successfully executed on quantum computing devices, as well as on noisy quantum simulators, applied to small datasets. Preliminary empirical results suggest that the algorithm is robust to noise.</description>

      <title>Conservation, convergence, and computation for evolving heterogeneous elastic wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic energy of a bending-resistant interface depends both on its geometry and its material composition. We consider such a heterogeneous interface in the plane, modeled by a curve equipped with an additional density function. The resulting energy captures the complex interplay between curvature and density effects, resembling the Canham-Helfrich functional. We describe the curve by its inclination angle, so that the equilibrium equations reduce to an elliptic system of second order. After a brief variational discussion, we investigate the associated nonlocal $L^2$-gradient flow evolution, a coupled quasilinear parabolic problem. We analyze the (non)preservation of quantities such as convexity, positivity, and symmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the system. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Approximating reproduction numbers: a general numerical method for age-structured models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general numerical method to approximate the reproduction numbers of a large class of multi-group, age-structured, population models with a finite age span. To provide complete flexibility in the definition of the birth and transition processes, we propose an equivalent formulation for the age-integrated state within the extended space framework. Then, we discretize the birth and transition operators via pseudospectral collocation. We discuss applications to epidemic models with continuous and piecewise continuous rates, with different interpretations of the age variable (e.g., demographic age, infection age and disease age) and the transmission terms (e.g., horizontal and vertical transmission). The tests illustrate that the method can compute different reproduction numbers, including the basic and type reproduction numbers as special cases.</description>

      <title>Analysis of singular subspaces under random perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of singular vector and singular subspace perturbations in the context of the signal plus random Gaussian noise matrix model. Assuming a low-rank signal matrix, we extend the Davis-Kahan-Wedin theorem in a fully generalized manner, applicable to any unitarily invariant matrix norm, extending previous results of O'Rourke, Vu and the author. We also obtain the fine-grained results, which encompass the $\ell_\infty$ analysis of singular vectors, the $\ell_{2, \infty}$ analysis of singular subspaces, as well as the exploration of linear and bilinear functions related to the singular vectors. Moreover, we explore the practical implications of these findings, in the context of the Gaussian mixture model and the submatrix localization problem.</description>
