Abstract: We study compact complex manifolds $M$ admitting a conformal holomorphic Riemannian structure invariant under the action of a complex semi-simple Lie group $G$. We prove that if the group $G$ acts transitively and essentially, then $M$ is conformally flat.</description>

      <title>The lower bound of first Dirichlet eigenvalue of p-Laplacian in Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of bounded domains for the $p$-Laplacian in complete Riemannian manifolds. Firstly, we establish a lower bound for this eigenvalue under the condition that the domain includes a specific function which fulfills certain criteria related to divergence and gradient conditions. As an application, we show that $p(\lambda_{1,p})^{1/p}$ is an increasing function about $p.$ We further explore Barta's inequality and other relevant applications stemming from this foundational result. In the subsequent section, we introduce an enhanced lower bound for the eigenvalue, which is linked to the distance function defined in the domain. As a practical application, we provide an estimation for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of geodesic balls with large radius in asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces with capillary boundary evolving by volume preserving power mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a volume- or area-preserving curvature flow for hypersurfaces with capillary boundary in the half-space, with speed given by a positive power of the mean curvature with a non-local averaging term. We demonstrate that for any convex initial hypersurface with a capillary boundary, the flow exists for all time and smoothly converges to a spherical cap as $t \to +\infty$</description>

      <title>On the incompleteness of $G_2$-moduli spaces along degenerating families of $G_2$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a formula for the energy of a path in the moduli space of a compact $G_2$-manifold with vanishing first Betti number for the volume-normalised $L^2$-metric. This allows us to give simple sufficient conditions for a path of torsion-free $G_2$-structures to have finite energy and length. We deduce that the compact $G_2$-manifolds produced by the generalised Kummer construction have incomplete moduli spaces. Under some assumptions, we also state a necessary condition for the limit of a path of torsion-free $G_2$-structures to be at infinite distance in the moduli space.</description>

      <title>Effective volume growth of three-manifolds with positive scalar curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove an effective linear volume growth for complete three-manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive scalar curvature. This recovers the results obtained by Munteanu-Wang. Our method builds upon recent work by Chodosh-Li-Stryker, which utilizes the technique of $\mu$-bubbles and the almost-splitting theorem by Cheeger-Colding.</description>

      <title>Solutions to ${\rm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system with cone singularities via toric curves on compact Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact Riemann surface (X) with finite punctures (P_1, \ldots, P_k), we define toric curves as multi-valued, totally unramified holomorphic maps to (\mathbb{P}^n) with monodromy in a maximal torus of ({\rm PSU}(n+1)). \textit{Toric solutions} for the ({\rm SU}(n+1)) system on $X\setminus\{P_1,\ldots, P_k\}$ are recognized by their associated {\it toric} curves in (\mathbb{P}^n). We introduce a character n-ensemble as an (n)-tuple of meromorphic one-forms with simple poles and purely imaginary periods, generating toric curves on (X) minus finitely many points. We establish on $X$ a correspondence between character $n$-ensembles and toric solutions to the ({\rm SU}(n+1)) system with finitely many cone singularities. Our approach not only broadens seminal solutions for up to two cone singularities on the Riemann sphere, as classified by Jost-Wang (Int. Math. Res. Not., (6):277-290, 2002) and Lin-Wei-Ye (Invent. Math., 190(1):169-207, 2012), but also advances beyond the limits of Lin-Yang-Zhong's existence theorems (J. Differential Geom., 114(2):337-391, 2020) by introducing a new solution class.</description>

      <title>Minimal Lagrangian surfaces in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ via the loop group method Part II: The general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the techniques introduced in \cite{DoMaB1} for contractible Riemann surfaces to construct minimal Lagrangian immersions from arbitrary Riemann surfaces into $\mathbb{C}P^2$ via the loop group method. Based on the potentials of translationally equivariant minimal Lagrangian surfaces, we introduce perturbed equivariant minimal Lagrangian surfaces in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ and construct a class of minimal Lagrangian cylinders. Furthermore, we show that these minimal Lagrangian cylinders approximate Delaunay cylinders with respect to some weighted Wiener norm of the twisted loop group $\Lambda SU(3)_{\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>Radial fields on the manifolds of symmetric positive definite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On Hadamard manifolds, the radial fields, which are the negative gradients of the Busemann functions, can be used to designate a canonical sense of direction. This has many potential interesting applications to Hadamard manifold-valued data, for example in defining notions of quantiles or treatment effects. Some of the most commonly encountered Hadamard manifolds in statistics are the spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices, which are used in, for example, covariance matrix analysis and diffusion tensor imaging. In this paper, we derive an expression for the radial fields on these manifolds and demonstrate their smoothness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the existence of a $Z$-positive and $Z$-critical Hermitian metric on a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle over a compact K\"ahler surface implies that the bundle is $Z$-stable. As particular cases, we obtain stability results for the deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills equation and the almost Hermite-Einstein equation for rank 2 bundles over surfaces. We show examples of $Z$-unstable bundles and $Z$-critical metrics away from the large volume limit.</description>

      <title>On the normal stability of the 4-harmonic and the ES-4-harmonic hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both 4-harmonic and ES-4-harmonic maps are two higher order generalizations of the well-studied harmonic map equation given by a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation of order eight. Due to the large number of derivatives it is very difficult to find any difference in the qualitative behavior of these two variational problems. It is well known that the small hypersphere $\iota\colon\mathbb{S}^m(\frac{1}{\sqrt{4}})\to\mathbb{S}^{m+1}$ is a critical point of both the 4-energy as well as the ES-4-energy but up to now it has not been investigated if there is a difference concerning its stability.
  The main contribution of this article is to show that the small hypersphere is unstable with respect to normal variations both as 4-harmonic hypersphere as well as ES-4-harmonic hypersphere and that its normal index equals one in both cases.</description>

      <title>Stability in the Banach isometric conjecture and nearly monochromatic Finsler surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Banach isometric conjecture asserts that a normed space with all of its $k$-dimensional subspaces isometric, where $k\geq 2$, is Euclidean. The first case of $k=2$ is classical, established by Auerbach, Mazur and Ulam using an elegant topological argument. We refine their method to arrive at a stable version of their result: if all $2$-dimensional subspaces are almost isometric, then the space is almost Euclidean. Furthermore, we show that a $2$-dimensional surface, which is not a torus or a Klein bottle, equipped with a near-monochromatic Finsler metric, is approximately Riemannian. The stability is quantified explicitly using the Banach-Mazur distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive new singular value decompositions and range characterizations for the X-ray transform on the Poincar\'e disk, a surjectivity result for the backprojection operator, as well as new functional settings and intertwining relations with appropriately defined differential operators. The approach mainly exploits analogous results recently obtained for the Euclidean disk, together with the projective equivalence between the two models.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Odzijewicz, Berezin and Fedosov-type quantizations on smooth compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Odzijewicz, Berezin and Fedosov-type quantization on compact smooth manifolds. The method is as follows. We embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ (and in the Fedosov quantization case embed into any real $2n$ dimensional symplectic manifold). The pullback coherent states are defined in the usual way. In the Odzijewicz-type, Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of geometric quantization is the pullback by the embedding of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Kohinoor Ghosh (where we had needed totally real embedding). The Fedosov-type quantization is carried out by restriction to the submanifold given by the embedding.</description>

Abstract: We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for solving a general class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations on closed Riemannian or hermitian manifolds, including both hessian and hessian quotient equations. It settles an open problem of Li and Urbas. Such a condition is based on an analytic slope invariant analogous to the slope stability and the Nakai-Moishezon criterion in complex geometry. As an application, we solve the non-constant $J$-equation on both hermitian manifolds and singular K\"ahler spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of "hyperbolic directions" in groups acting cocompactly on properly convex domains in real projective space, from three different perspectives simultaneously: the (coarse) metric geometry of the Hilbert metric, the projective geometry of the boundary of the domain, and the singular value gaps of projective automorphisms. We describe the relationship between different definitions of "Morse" and "regular" quasi-geodesics arising in these three different contexts. This generalizes several results of Benoist and Guichard to the non-Gromov hyperbolic setting.</description>

Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem for random currents of integration along the zero divisors of standard Gaussian holomorphic sections in a sequence of holomorphic line bundles with Hermitian metrics of class $\mathscr{C}^{3}$ over a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. In the course of our analysis, we derive first-order asymptotics and upper decay estimates for near and off-diagonal Bergman kernels, respectively. These results are essential for determining the statistical properties of the zeros of random holomorphic sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a Hamiltonian Lie algebroid over a pre-symplectic manifold and over a Poisson manifold, we introduce a map corresponding to a comomentum map, called a comomentum section. We show that the comomentum section gives a Lie algebroid morphism among Lie algebroids. Moreover, we prove that a momentum section on a Hamiltonian Lie algebroid is a Poisson map between proper Poisson manifolds, which is a generalization that a momentum map is a Poisson map between the symplectic manifold to dual of the Lie algebra. Finally, a momentum section is reinterpreted as a Dirac morphism on Dirac structures.</description>

      <title>Rectifiable Reifenberg and uniform positivity under almost calibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Reifenberg theorem \cite{reif_orig} tells us that if a set $S\subseteq B_2\subseteq \mathbb R^n$ is uniformly close on all points and scales to a $k$-dimensional subspace, then $S$ is H\"older homeomorphic to a $k$-dimensional Euclidean ball. In general this is sharp, for instance such an $S$ may have infinite volume, be fractal in nature, and have no rectifiable structure.
  The goal of this note is to show that we can improve upon this for an almost calibrated Reifenberg set, or more generally under a positivity condition in the context of an $\epsilon$-calibration $\Omega$ . An $\epsilon$-calibration is very general, the condition holds locally for all continuous $k$-forms such that $\Omega[L]\leq 1+\epsilon$ for all $k$-planes $L$. We say an oriented $k$-plane $L$ is $\alpha$-positive with respect to $\Omega$ if $\Omega[L]&gt;\alpha&gt;0$. If $\Omega[L]&gt;\alpha&gt; 1-\epsilon$ then we call $L$ an $\epsilon$-calibrated plane.
  The main result of this paper is then the following. Assume at all points and scales $B_r(x)\subseteq B_2$ that $S$ is $\delta$-Hausdorff close to a subspace $L_{x,r}$ which is uniformly positive $\Omega[L_{x,r}]&gt;\alpha $ with respect to an $\epsilon$-calibration. Then $S$ is $k$-rectifiable with uniform volume bounds.</description>

Abstract: Teissier problem aims to characterize the equality case of Khovanskii-Teissier type inequality for $(1,1)$-classes on a compact K\"ahler manifold. When each of the involved $(1,1)$-classes is assumed to be nef and big, this problem has been solved by the previous works of Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson, Fu-Xiao and Li. In this note, we shall settle the case that the involved $(1,1)$-classes are just assumed to be nef. We also extend the results to some settings where some of the $(1,1)$-classes are not necessarily nef. By constructing examples, it is shown that our results are optimal.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact Riemannian manifold, of dimension between 3 and 7, with boundary, we adapt Song's method in Song (2023) to the free boundary case to show that the Morse index of a free boundary minimal hypersurface grows linearly with the sum of its Betti numbers, where the constant of growth depends on the area of the free boundary minimal hypersurface in question.</description>

      <title>Parabolic quasi-contact cone structures with an infinitesimal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret the property of having an infinitesimal symmetry as a variational property in certain geometric structures. This is achieved by establishing a one-to-one correspondence between a class of cone structures with an infinitesimal symmetry and geometric structures arising from certain systems of ODEs that are variational. Such cone structures include pseudo-Riemannian conformal structures and distributions of growth vector (2,3,5) and (3,6). The correspondence is obtained via symmetry reduction and quasi-contactification. Subsequently, for each class of such cone structures we provide invariant conditions that imply more specific properties, such as having a null infinitesimal symmetry, being foliated by null submanifolds, or having reduced holonomy to the appropriate contact parabolic subgroup. As an application of our results we give an alternative proof of the variationality of chains in CR geometry.</description>

      <title>Extremal metrics for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on manifolds with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show there are no extremal metrics for the eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian on any compact manifold. Nonetheless, we construct examples of conformally extremal metrics for the eigenvalues of this operator in any annulus and characterise these special metrics in the general case of a compact manifold of dimension $n \geq 2$. As for the Dirichlet Laplacian, we prove non existence of extremal metrics on any compact surface.</description>

      <title>Reverse H\"older inequalities on the space of K\"ahler metrics of a Fano variety and effective openness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reverse H\"older inequality is established on the space of K\"ahler metrics in the first Chern class of a Fano manifold X endowed with Darvas L^{p}-Finsler metrics. The inequality holds under a uniform bound on a twisted Ricci potential and extends to Fano varieties with log terminal singularities. Its proof leverages a "hidden" log-concavity. An application to destabilizing geodesic rays is provided, which yields a reverse H\"older inequality for the speed of the geodesic. In the case of Aubin's continuity path on a K-unstable Fano variety, the constant in the corresponding H\"older bound is shown to only depend on p and the dimension of X. This leads to some intruiging relations to Harnack bounds and the partial C^{0}-estimate. In another direction, universal effective openness results are established for the complex singularity exponents (log canonical thresholds) of \omega-plurisubharmonic functions on any Fano variety. Finally, another application to K-unstable Fano varieties is given, involving Archimedean Igusa zeta functions.</description>

      <title>$L^\infty$ estimate for the potential of quaternionic Gauduchon metric with prescribed volume form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quaternionic Calabi conjecture was raised by Alesker and Verbitsky \cite{Alesker-Verbitsky (2010)}, it predicts that one can solve the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equation on any compact HKT manifold. Motivated by this conjecture a quaternionic version of Gauduchon conjecture on any compact $SL(n,\H)$-manifold will be introduced, namely the existence of quaternionic Gauduchon metrics with prescribed volume form. We reformulate this question into a special case of fully nonlinear elliptic equations of second order, and the $L^{\infty}$ estimate for the potential function will be established.</description>

      <title>A weighted Reilly formula for differential forms and sharp Steklov eigenvalue estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First we establish a weighted Reilly formula for differential forms on a smooth compact oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary. Then we give two applications of this formula when the manifold satisfies certain geometric conditions. One is a sharp lower bound for the first positive eigenvalue of the Steklov eigenvalue problem on differential forms investigated by Belishev and Sharafutdinov (2008) and Karpukhin (2019). The other one is a comparison result between the spectrum of this Steklov eigenvalue problem and the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian on the boundary of the manifold. Besides, at the end we discuss an open problem for differential forms analogous to Escobar's conjecture (1999) for functions.</description>

      <title>Completeness and geodesic distance properties for fractional Sobolev metrics on spaces of immersed curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the space of immersed closed curves equipped with reparametrization-invariant Riemannian metrics; the metrics we consider are Sobolev metrics of possible fractional order $q\in [0,\infty)$. We establish the critical Sobolev index on the metric for several key geometric properties. Our first main result shows that the Riemannian metric induces a metric space structure if and only if $q&gt;1/2$. Our second main result shows that the metric is geodesically-complete (i.e., the geodesic equation is globally well-posed) if $q&gt;3/2$, whereas if $q&lt;3/2$ then finite-time blowup may occur. The geodesic-completeness for $q&gt;3/2$ is obtained by proving metric-completeness of the space of $H^q$-immersed curves with the distance induced by the Riemannian metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold satisfying a weighted Poincar\'e inequality, and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a Hermitian vector bundle over $M$ equipped with a metric covariant derivative $\nabla$. We consider the operator $H_{X,V}=\nabla^{\dagger}\nabla+\nabla_{X}+ V$, where $\nabla^{\dagger}$ is the formal adjoint of $\nabla$ with respect to the inner product in the space of square-integrable sections of $\mathcal{E}$, $X$ is a smooth (real) vector field on $M$, and $V$ is a fiberwise self-adjoint, smooth section of the endomorphism bundle $\textrm{End }\mathcal{E}$. We give a sufficient condition for the triviality of the $L^2$-kernel of $H_{X,V}$. As a corollary, putting $X\equiv 0$ and working in the setting of a Clifford bundle equipped with a Clifford connection $\nabla$, we obtain the triviality of the $L^2$-kernel of $D^2$, where $D$ is the Dirac operator corresponding to $\nabla$. In particular, when $\mathcal{E}=\Lambda^{k}T^*M$ and $D^2$ is the Hodge--deRham Laplacian on $k$-forms, we recover some recent vanishing results for $L^2$-harmonic $k$-forms.</description>

      <title>Radial Gravitational Collapse Causes Timelike Incompleteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a globally hyperbolic spacetime containing a trapped surface and satisfying the strong energy condition and a condition on certain radial tidal forces must be timelike geodesically incomplete. This constitutes a "timelike" version of Penrose's celebrated singularity theorem. Recall that the latter concludes that certain spacetimes are null incomplete, providing the first theoretical evidence that black holes actually exist in our Universe. By concluding timelike instead of null incompleteness, we obtain, at the expense of stronger assumptions, a clearer physical interpretation and the existence of an event horizon.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e, P. Bohl and A. Denjoy. P. Bohl, back in 1916, emphasised the importance of the transfer of the results for the order $k=1$ to the case $k&gt;1$, adding at the same time: "However, any attempt to do so would be hopeless". The following more than hundred years have only confirmed Bohl's forecast. It became clear that a new approach to this problem is needed.
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying certain important conditions. Limit sets and left and right rotation vectors appear in the case $k&gt;1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1.$ Under simple and natural conditions, the left and right rotation vectors coincide and a precise analog of the well-known H. Poincar\'e's result is derived for $k&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Flow by Gauss curvature to the Minkowski problem of p-harmonic measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem of harmonic measures was first studied by Jerison [19]. Recently, Akman and Mukherjee [1] studied the Minkowski problem corresponding to $p$-harmonic measures on convex domains and generalized Jerison's results. In this paper, we prove the existence of the smooth solution to the Minkowski problem for the $p$-harmonic measure by method of the Gauss curvature flow.</description>
