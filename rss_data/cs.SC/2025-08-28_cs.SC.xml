      <title>Scaling Up Reachability Analysis for Rectangular Automata with Random Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents optimizations to improve the scalability of reachability analysis on a subclass of hybrid automata extended with stochasticity. The optimizations target different components of the analysis, such as quantifier elimination for state set projection, and automated parameter selection during the numerical integration. Most importantly, whereas the original method combines forward and backward reachability, we show that the usage of backward reachability is optional for computing maximal reachability probabilities.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous LLM Methods for Ontology Learning (Few-Shot Prompting, Ensemble Typing, and Attention-Based Taxonomies)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive system for addressing Tasks A, B, and C of the LLMs4OL 2025 challenge, which together span the full ontology construction pipeline: term extraction, typing, and taxonomy discovery. Our approach combines retrieval-augmented prompting, zero-shot classification, and attention-based graph modeling -- each tailored to the demands of the respective task. For Task A, we jointly extract domain-specific terms and their ontological types using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Training data was reformulated into a document to terms and types correspondence, while test-time inference leverages semantically similar training examples. This single-pass method requires no model finetuning and improves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which involves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the few-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG scheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen domains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores from multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting. In Task C, we model taxonomy discovery as graph inference. Using embeddings of type labels, we train a lightweight cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations by approximating a soft adjacency matrix. These modular, task-specific solutions enabled us to achieve top-ranking results in the official leaderboard across all three tasks. Taken together these strategies showcase the scalability, adaptability, and robustness of LLM-based architectures for ontology learning across heterogeneous domains.

      <title>Effective Asymptotics of Combinatorial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics studies asymptotic properties of families of combinatorial objects using complex analysis on their generating functions. In their reference book on the subject, Flajolet and Sedgewick describe a general approach that allows one to derive precise asymptotic expansions starting from systems of combinatorial equations. In the situation where the combinatorial system involves only cartesian products and disjoint unions, the generating functions satisfy polynomial systems with positivity constraints for which many results and algorithms are known. We extend these results to the general situation. This produces an almost complete algorithmic chain going from combinatorial systems to asymptotic expansions. Thus, it is possible to compute asymptotic expansions of all generating functions produced by the symbolic method of Flajolet and Sedgewick when they have algebraic-logarithmic singularities (which can be decided), under the assumption that Schanuel's conjecture from number theory holds. That conjecture is not needed for systems that do not involve the constructions of sets and cycles.</description>

      <title>Solving generic parametric linear matrix inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) $A = A_0 + x_1 A_1 + ... + x_n A_n \succeq 0$ with the $A_i$'s being $m \times m$ symmetric matrices, with entries in a ring $\mathcal{R}$. When $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{R}$, the feasibility problem consists in deciding whether the $x_i$'s can be instantiated to obtain a positive semidefinite matrix. When $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Q}[y_1, ... , y_t]$, the problem asks for a formula on the parameters $y_1, ..., y_t$, which describes the values of the parameters for which the specialized LMI is feasible. This problem can be solved using general quantifier elimination algorithms, with a complexity that is exponential in n. In this work, we leverage the LMI structure of the problem to design an algorithm that computes a formula $\Phi$ describing a dense subset of the feasible region of parameters, under genericity assumptions. The complexity of this algorithm is exponential in n, m and t but becomes polynomial in $n$ when $m$ and $t$ are fixed. We apply the algorithm to a parametric sum-of-squares problem and to the convergence analyses of certain first-order optimization methods, which are both known to be equivalent to the feasibility of certain parametric LMIs, hence demonstrating its practical interest.</description>
