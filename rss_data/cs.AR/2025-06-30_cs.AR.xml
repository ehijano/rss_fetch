      <title>Power- and Area-Efficient Unary Sorting Architecture Using FSM-Based Unary Number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer systems and is widely used in applications such as databases, data analytics, and hardware accelerators. Unary computing has recently emerged as a low-cost and power-efficient paradigm for implementing hardware sorters by eliminating the need for complex arithmetic operations. However, existing comparison-free unary computing-based designs suffer from significant area and power overhead due to costly unary number generators.
  In this paper, we present a novel ascending-order unary sorting module featuring a finite-state-machine-based unary number generator that significantly reduces implementation costs. By generating right-aligned unary streams using a two-state finite-state machine, our architecture iteratively identifies the minimum input value in each cycle without conventional comparators. Synthesis results in a 45nm technology node demonstrate up to 82% reduction in area and 70% reduction in power consumption compared to state-of-the-art unary designs. The proposed sorter offers a promising solution for energy-constrained and resource-limited hardware systems.</description>

      <title>Hardware acceleration for ultra-fast Neural Network training on FPGA for MRF map reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a fast quantitative MR Imaging technique that provides multi-parametric maps with a single acquisition. Neural Networks (NNs) accelerate reconstruction but require significant resources for training. We propose an FPGA-based NN for real-time brain parameter reconstruction from MRF data. Training the NN takes an estimated 200 seconds, significantly faster than standard CPU-based training, which can be up to 250 times slower. This method could enable real-time brain analysis on mobile devices, revolutionizing clinical decision-making and telemedicine.</description>

      <title>FloorPlan-DeepSeek (FPDS): A multimodal approach to floorplan generation using vector-based next room prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction' mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling. Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting future intelligent architectural design.</description>

      <title>When Servers Meet Species: A Fab-to-Grave Lens on Computing's Biodiversity Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss is a critical planetary boundary, yet its connection to computing remains largely unexamined. Prior sustainability efforts in computing have focused on carbon and water, overlooking biodiversity due to the lack of appropriate metrics and modeling frameworks. This paper presents the first end-to-end analysis of biodiversity impact from computing systems. We introduce two new metrics--Embodied Biodiversity Index (EBI) and Operational Biodiversity Index (OBI)--to quantify biodiversity impact across the lifecycle, and present FABRIC, a modeling framework that links computing workloads to biodiversity impacts. Our evaluation highlights the need to consider biodiversity alongside carbon and water in sustainable computing design and optimization. The code is available at https://github.com/TianyaoShi/FABRIC.</description>
