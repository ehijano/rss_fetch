      <title>Dataset of Tensile Properties for Sub-sized Specimens of Nuclear Structural Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical testing with sub-sized specimens plays an important role in the nuclear industry, facilitating tests in confined experimental spaces with lower irradiation levels and accelerating the qualification of new materials. The reduced size of specimens results in different material behavior at the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale, in comparison to standard-sized specimens, which is referred to as the specimen size effect. Although analytical models have been proposed to correlate the properties of sub-sized specimens to standard-sized specimens, these models lack broad applicability across different materials and testing conditions. The objective of this study is to create the first large public dataset of tensile properties for sub-sized specimens used in nuclear structural materials. We performed an extensive literature review of relevant publications and extracted over 1,000 tensile testing records comprising 54 parameters including material type and composition, manufacturing information, irradiation conditions, specimen dimensions, and tensile properties. The dataset can serve as a valuable resource to investigate the specimen size effect and develop computational methods to correlate the tensile properties of sub-sized specimens.</description>

      <title>Integration of high-performance compact interferometric sensors in a suspended interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homodyne Quadrature Interferometers (HoQIs) are compact, low noise and high dynamic range displacement sensors designed for use in gravitational wave observatories. Their lower noise compared to the displacement sensors used at present makes them valuable for improving the seismic isolation in current and future detectors. This paper outlines the progression of this sensor from initial production and benchtop tests to in-vacuum static performance and installation in a gravitational wave detector prototype facility. A detailed design description is outlined, including the full signal and optical chain required for implementation in detectors. The measured in-vacuum static performance indicates a noise floor of $3-4\times10^{-13}m/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at 10Hz. Three HoQIs were installed on the beamsplitter suspension at the AEI 10m prototype. They measured motion of the intermediate mass across the entire bandwidth measured and showed minimal non-linearities and a good robustness to motion in unmeasured degrees of freedom, both important for practical use in dynamic systems such as seismic isolation.</description>

      <title>Investigations of Charge Collection and Signal Timing in a multi-pixel Silicon Drift Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are a minimal extension of the Standard Model of particle physics and a promising candidate for dark matter if their mass is in the keV-range. The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment (KATRIN), equipped with a novel multi-pixel silicon drift detector array, the TRISTAN detector, will be capable of searching for these keV-scale sterile neutrinos by investigating the kinematics of the tritium $\beta$-decay. This measurement will be performed after the completion of the neutrino mass measurement campaign. To detect a sterile neutrino signal with a high sensitivity, a profound understanding of the detector response is required. In this work, we report on the characterization of a 7-pixel TRISTAN prototype detector with a laser system. We present the experimental results obtained in high-resolution scans of the detector surface with a focused laser beam and demonstrate how the charge collection and the timing of the signals generated in the detector is related to the detector geometry. A comparison of the experimental data with simulations shows a good agreement.</description>

      <title>Quadrature amplitude modulation for electronic sideband Pound-Drever-Hall locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique is routinely used to stabilize the frequency of a laser to a reference cavity. The electronic sideband (ESB) locking scheme, a PDH variant, helps bridge the frequency difference between the quantized frequencies enforced by the cavity and the laser frequency of interest. Here we use quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a technique used in digital signal communication, to engineer the high-quality phase-modulated radio-frequency (rf) signal required for ESB locking scheme. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the effects of in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) impairments on the ESB error signal for ultra-narrow linewidth lasers. We design and implement two baseband-sampling software-defined radio variants for implementing QAM that compensate for these I/Q impairments. Using these variants, we engineer high-quality phase-modulated radio-frequency (rf) signals with a large phase modulation index of 1.01 radians, a maximum modulation frequency of 3 MHz, a tunable carrier wave frequency range of 450 MHz to 4 GHz, and I/Q errors of less than 2.25 % over the entire carrier wave frequency range.</description>

      <title>GRAPH -- An readout ASIC for large MCP based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a programmable 16 channel, mixed signal, low power readout ASIC, having the project historically named Gigasample Recorder of Analog waveforms from a PHotodetector (GRAPH). It is designed to read large aperture single photon imaging detectors using micro channel plates for charge multiplication, and measuring the detector's response on crossed strips anodes to extrapolate the incoming photon position. Each channel consists of a fast, low power and low noise charge sensitive amplifier, which provides a myriad of coarse and fine programmable options for gain and shaping settings. Further, the amplified signal is recorded using, to our knowledge novel, the Hybrid Universal sampLing Architecture (HULA), a mixed signal double buffer memory, that enables concurrent waveform recording, and selected event digitized data extraction. The sampling frequency is freely adjustable between few~kHz up to 125~MHz, while the chip's internal digital memory holds a history 2048 samples for each channel, with a digital headroom of 12 bits. An optimized region of interest sample-read algorithm allows to extract the information just around the event pulse peak, while selecting the next event, thus substantially reducing the operational dead time. The chip is designed in 130~$n$m TSMC CMOS technology, and its power consumption is around 47~$m$W per channel.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Lower Temporal Limit of Laser-Produced Plasma Sources for Table-Top Soft X-ray NEXAFS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements for understanding dynamics in molecular and material systems has led to many advances in table-top sources for pulsed X-rays. We report on a table top laser-produced plasma (LPP) source that can perform soft X-ray (SXR), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements using a laser source with 23 ps pulse duration. The spectrometer's key specifications, such as brilliance, resolution, and stability, are characterized against the more commonly used longer-pulse-duration LPP sources. The 23 ps laser produced approximately an order of magnitude weaker SXR flux than the 8 ns laser for a higher power density due to the smaller total energy absorbed by the plasma. The increased repetition rate and an implemented self-referencing scheme still allowed for high-resolution, synchrotron-like NEXAFS measurements of Si3N4 and TiO2 thin films with 2.5 minute acquisition times. It was observed that degradation of the gas jet nozzle led to long-term instability of the source, which can be remediated using alternative nozzle designs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving higher temporal resolution in future time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements using table-top laser-produced plasma sources</description>
