      <title>Green's function approach to interacting lattice polaritons and optical nonlinearities in subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-wavelength arrays of quantum emitters offer an efficient free-space approach to coherent light-matter interfacing, using ultracold atoms or two-dimensional solid-state quantum materials. The combination of collectively suppressed photon-losses and emerging optical nonlinearities due to strong photon-coupling to mesoscopic numbers of emitters holds promise for generating nonclassical light and engineering effective interactions between freely propagating photons. While most studies have thus far relied on numerical simulations, we describe here a diagrammatic Green's function approach that permits analytical investigations of nonlinear processes. We illustrate the method by deriving a simple expression for the scattering matrix that describes photon-photon interactions in an extended two-dimensional array of quantum emitters, and reproduces the results of numerical simulations of coherently driven arrays. The approach yields intuitive insights into the nonlinear response of the system and offers a promising framework for a systematic development of a theory for interacting photons and many-body effects on collective radiance in two-dimensional arrays of quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement for open systems by non-hermitian linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lower bound of estimated accuracy for a parameter unitarily encoded in closed systems has been obtained, and both optimal initial states and detection operators can be designed guided by the lower bound. In this letter, we demonstrate that the lower bound of estimated accuracy for a dissipative parameter non-unitarily encoded in open systems based on the non-hermitian linear response theory. This lower bound is related to the correlation of the encoding dissipative operator for open systems in contrast to the fluctuation of the encoding operator for closed systems. We also explicitly calculate the estimated accuracy for dissipative parameters corresponding to three different kinds of non-unitarily encoding processes, including particle loss, relaxation, and dephasing, which further confirm this lower bound. We finally compare the lower bound with the quantum Fisher information obtained by tomography, and we find they are consistent under suitable initial states and detection operators. This lower bound can guide us to find the optimal initial states and detection operators to significantly simplify the measurement process.</description>

      <title>Universal spectrum of non efimovian three-body resonances at finite scattering length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using exact solutions of the three-body problem, the spectrum of non efimovian three-body resonances for two identical particles interacting with another one is derived in the regime of large but finite scattering length. The universality of the problem is depicted by using a contact model in the generalized effective range approximation, parameterized by two three-body parameters and the scattering length.</description>

      <title>Entanglement classification and \emph{non-k}-separability certification via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-class fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems can be characterised using the notions of \emph{k}-separability and entanglement depth. A quantum state is \emph{k}-separable if it can be expressed as a mixture of \emph{k} entangled subsystems, and its entanglement depth is given by the size of the largest entangled subsystem. In this paper we propose a multipartite entanglement measure that satisfies the following criteria: (i) it can be used with both pure and mixed states; (ii) it is encoded in a single element of the density matrix, so it does not require knowledge of the full spectrum of the density matrix; (iii) it can be applied to large systems; and (iv) it can be experimentally verified. The proposed method allows the certification of \emph{non-k}-separability of a given quantum state. We show that the proposed method successfully classifies three-qubit systems into known stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) classes, namely bipartite, \mbox{W-,} and GHZ-type entanglement. Furthermore, we characterise the \emph{non-k}-separability in known nine SLOCC classes of four-qubit states, absolutely maximally entangled states for five and six qubits and for arbitrary size qubit Dicke states.</description>

      <title>Superfluid excitations in rotating two-dimensional ring traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate confined in ring trap configurations that can be produced starting with a bubble trap confinement, approximated by a Mexican hat and shifted harmonic oscillator potentials. Using a variational technique and perturbation theory, we determined the vortex configurations in this system by varying the interparticle interaction and the angular velocity of the atomic cloud. We found that the phase diagram of the system has macrovortex structures for small positive values of the interaction parameter, and the charge of the central vortex increases with rotation. Strengthening the atomic interaction makes the macrovortex unstable, and it decays into multiple singly-charged vortices that arrange themselves in a lattice configuration. We also look for experimentally realizable methods to determine the vortex configuration without relying upon absorption imaging since the structures are not always visible in the latter. More specifically, we study how the vortex distribution affects the collective modes of the condensate by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically and by analytical predictions using the sum-rule approach for the frequencies of the modes. These results reveal important signatures to characterize the macrovortices and vortex lattice transitions in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin ice in three-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter whose low-energy physics is described as the deconfined phase of an emergent gauge theory. With recent theory proposals and an experiment showing preliminary signs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order [G. Semeghini et al., Science 374, 1242 (2021)], Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid. In this work, we propose a way to realize a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of $U(1)$ gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of "magnetic" monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of "electric" charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Scale and conformal invariance in rotating interacting few-fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that rotating two-dimensional Fermi gases possess a nonrelativistic scale and conformal invariance at weak but nonzero interactions, where the scale invariance of universal short-range interactions is not yet broken by quantum effects. We demonstrate the symmetry in the excitation spectrum of few-fermion ensembles in a harmonic trap obtained by exact diagonalization. The excitation spectrum is shown to split in a set of primary states and derived excited states that consist of breathing modes as well as two different center-of-mass excitations, which describe cyclotron and guiding-center excitations of the total particle cloud. Furthermore, the conformal symmetry is manifest in the many-body wave function, where it dictates the form of the hyperradial component, which we demonstrate using Monte Carlo sampling of few-body wave functions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of time crystal behavior for a few boson chiral soliton model in a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04843v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations for a chiral soliton model with N=2,3 bosons in a ring, this being a few-particle version of our previous mean-field model for a quantum time crystal. Following Syrwid, Kosior, and Sacha (SKS), the notion is that a precise position measurement of one particle can lead to spontaneous formation of a bright soliton that in a time crystal should rotate intact for at least a few revolutions around the ring. In their work SKS find spontaneous formation of a soliton due to the position measurement, but quantum fluctuations cause the soliton to subsequently decay before it has a chance to perform even one revolution of the ring. Based on this they conclude that time crystal dynamics are impossible. In contrast, for our few boson chiral soliton model, and allowing for imprecise (weak) measurements of the particle position, we show that time crystal behavior is possible allowing for several revolutions of the spontaneously formed soliton around the ring. We therefore argue that our chiral soliton model can realize a quantum time crystal when weak position measurements are allowed for.</description>

      <title>Pairing properties of an odd-frequency superfluid Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate strong-coupling properties of an odd-frequency Fermi superfluid. This pairing state has the unique property that Cooper pairs are formed between fermions, not at the same time, but at different times. To see whether or not such unequal-time pairs still exhibit bosonic behavior, we examine the space-time structure of the odd-frequency Cooper-pair wavefunction at $T=0$, by employing the combined path-integral formalism with the BCS-Eagles-Leggett-type superfluid theory. In the strong-coupling regime, the odd-frequency pair wavefunction still has different space-time structure from that in the ordinary even-frequency $s$-wave superfluid state, their $\textit{magnitudes}$ are found to become close to each other, except for the equal-time pairing component. In this regime, we also evaluate the superfluid phase transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ within the framework of the strong-coupling theory developed by Nozi\`eres and Schmitt-Rink. The calculated $T_{\rm c}$ in the strong-coupling regime of the odd-frequency system is found to be well described by the Bose-Einstein condensation of tightly bound Bose molecules. Our results indicates that, in spite of vanishing equal-time pairing, odd-frequency Cooper pairs still behave like bosons in the strong-coupling regime, as in the even-frequency $s$-wave superfluid case.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum vortex dynamics and vortex-antivortex annihilation in Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices</title>

Abstract: Superfluids with strong spatial modulation can be experimentally produced in the area of cold atoms under the influence of optical lattices. Here we address $^{87}$Rb bosons at T=0 K in a flat geometry under the influence of a periodic potential with the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. The statics and dynamics of vortex excitations are studied in the case of one dimensional (1D) and of two dimensional (2D) optical lattices, as function of the intensity of the optical lattice. We compute how the vortex energy depends on the position of its core and the energy barrier that a vortex has to surmount in order to move in the superfluid. The dynamics of a vortex dipole, a pair of vortices of opposite chirality, differ profoundly from the case of a uniform superfluid. In the 1D case, when parallel ridges of density are present, the dynamics depends on the positions of the two vortices. If they are in the same channel between two ridges, then the two vortices approach each other until they annihilate each other in a short time. If the two vortices are in distinct channels the dipole undergoes a rigid translation but with a velocity depending on the intensity of the optical lattice and this translation velocity can even change sign with respect to the case of the uniform superfluid. Superimposed on this translation an oscillatory motion is also present. These oscillatory motions can be both longitudinal, i.e. along the channel, as well as transverse. In all cases the transverse motions are one-side, in the sense that the vortex core never crosses the equilibrium position nearest the starting position. In the case of the 2D lattices we study (square, triangular and honeycomb), the two vortices of a dipole move mainly by jumps between equilibrium positions and approach each other until annihilation.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-Localized Response in Quantum Critical Spin Systems: Insights from Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, certain quantum many-body systems in $d$-dimensions are equivalent to gravitational theories in $(d+1)$-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes. When a massless particle is sent from the AdS boundary to the bulk curved spacetime, it reaches another point of the boundary after a time lag. In the dual quantum system, it should appear as if quasiparticles have been transferred between two separated points. We theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon, which we call "spacetime-localized response," is actually observed in the dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model near the quantum critical point. This result suggests that, if we can realize a holographic spin system in a laboratory, the experimental probing of the emergent extra-dimension is possible by applying a designed stimulus to a quantum many-body system, which is holographically equivalent to sending a massless particle through the higher-dimensional curved bulk geometry. We also discuss possible experimental realizations using Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezers array.</description>

Abstract: Eigenvector continuation is a computational method for parametric eigenvalue problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts, discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent applications for quantum systems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Observation of a phase transition from a continuous to a discrete time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete (DTCs) and continuous time crystals (CTCs) are novel dynamical many-body states, that are characterized by robust self-sustained oscillations, emerging via spontaneous breaking of discrete or continuous time translation symmetry. DTCs are periodically driven systems that oscillate with a subharmonic of the external drive, while CTCs are continuously driven and oscillate with a frequency intrinsic to the system. Here, we explore a phase transition from a continuous time crystal to a discrete time crystal. A CTC with a characteristic oscillation frequency $\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ is prepared in a continuously pumped atom-cavity system. Modulating the pump intensity of the CTC with a frequency $\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}$ close to $2\,\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ leads to robust locking of $\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ to $\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/2$, and hence a DTC arises. This phase transition in a quantum many-body system is related to subharmonic injection locking of non-linear mechanical and electronic oscillators or lasers.</description>
