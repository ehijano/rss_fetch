      <title>Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is the first to explore the application of a time-series foundation model for VaR estimation. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&amp;P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that, in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. We also found that fine-tuning significantly improves the results, and the model should not be used in zero-shot settings. Overall, foundation models can provide completely alternative approaches to traditional econometric methods, yet there are challenges to be tackled.</description>

      <title>Solving The Dynamic Volatility Fitting Problem: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The volatility fitting is one of the core problems in the equity derivatives business. Through a set of deterministic rules, the degrees of freedom in the implied volatility surface encoding (parametrization, density, diffusion) are defined. Whilst very effective, this approach widespread in the industry is not natively tailored to learn from shifts in market regimes and discover unsuspected optimal behaviors. In this paper, we change the classical paradigm and apply the latest advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) to solve the fitting problem. In particular, we show that variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC) can achieve at least as good as standard fitting algorithms. Furthermore, we explain why the reinforcement learning framework is appropriate to handle complex objective functions and is natively adapted for online learning.</description>
