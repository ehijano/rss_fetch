      <title>The dimensionality of a coiled helical coil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helical coil is ubiquitous in biological and natural systems and often it is the basic form that leads to complex structures. This paper considers the question of its dimensionality in biological information as the helical coil goes through recursive coiling as happens to DNA and RNA molecules in chromatin. It has been shown that the dimensionality of coiled coils is virtually equal to e. Of the three forms of DNA, the dimensionality of the B-form is nearest to the optimal value and this might be the reason why it is most common.</description>

      <title>Towards an Innate Cell-Environment Nanothermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the PubMed database, there are around 260 manuscripts describing nanothermometers. These research articles detail the synthesis, performance, and application of intracellular nanothermometers. This intracellular prevalence is due to the significant importance, complexity, and utility of the intracellular compartments for understanding cell metabolism and disease treatment. However, in recent years, the extracellular environment of the cell has emerged as a crucial factor in medicine, particularly in hyperthermia and immunotherapy. Despite this, we have not seen evidence in the literature describing the utilization or performance of a nanothermometer designed for extracellular temperature measurements. This oversight not only neglects the potential for measuring extracellular temperature but also fails to address the extracellular environment of the cell. Here, we introduce a nanothermometer designed specifically for measuring extracellular temperature by directly converting serum proteins into nanothermometers (either unmodified or labeled with the clinically approved dye Fluorescein). Additionally, leveraging the extracellular localization of these nanothermometers, we demonstrate (1) the enhancement of their temperature sensitivity by combining them with gold nanorods, and (2) their capability to generate damage and disrupt the plasma membrane, thus opening the door to their use as photodynamic therapy agents. We firmly believe that these advancements represent not only a broadening of the applications of nanothermometry but also a pioneering step in showcasing the ability of nanothermometers to induce cell death.</description>

      <title>Active Loop Extrusion guides DNA-Protein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial organization of DNA involves DNA loop extrusion and the formation of protein-DNA condensates. While the significance of each process is increasingly recognized, their interplay remains unexplored. Using molecular dynamics simulation and theory we investigate this interplay. Our findings reveal that loop extrusion can enhance the dynamics of condensation and promotes coalescence and ripening of condensates. Further, the DNA loop enables condensate formation under DNA tension and position condensates. The concurrent presence of loop extrusion and condensate formation results in the formation of distinct domains similar to TADs, an outcome not achieved by either process alone.</description>

      <title>Increased antimicrobial activity of ZnO nanoparticle thin films: Effect of surface structuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the antimicrobial efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) films with varying microstructure, crystallographic orientation and surface roughness.  Thin films with different microstructures were obtained by varying precursor concentrations (0.1 M, 0.25 M, and 0.4 M) and solvent types (Ethanol, Propanol, and Butanol). The characterization of the films by X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed films with varying degrees of orientation along the c-axis, which increased with the concentration of the precursor and with the decrease in the carbon chain length of the alcohol. Raman spectroscopy analysis confirmed the formation of a hexagonal wurtzite ZnO. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dense and homogeneous films with a thickness of 93 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed changes in surface irregularity and an increase in surface roughness with the carbon length of solvent and a maximum roughness at a precursor concentration of 0.25 M in propanol. The antimicrobial activity was assessed following ISO 22196:2011 standards with few modifications. Results indicated that ZnO NPs films with rougher surfaces reduced coli (gram(-)), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram(-)) and Staphylococcus aureus (gram(+) ) bacteria populations due to an increase of contact surface between NPs with bacteria. Their effectiveness against Candida albicans was moderate, with a maximum reduction of 0.72 Log10 CFU/cm$^2$ with rougher film.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent sharpening of interfacial fluctuations in shape-based models of dense cellular sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of tissue interfaces -- between separate populations of cells, or between a group of cells and its environment -- has attracted intense theoretical, computational, and experimental study. Recent work on shape-based models inspired by dense epithelia have suggested a possible ``topological sharpening'' effect, by which four-fold vertices spatially coordinated along a cellular interface lead to a cusp-like restoring force acting on cells at the interface, which in turn greatly suppresses interfacial fluctuations. We revisit these interfacial fluctuations, focusing on the distinction between short length scale reduction of interfacial fluctuations and long length scale renormalized surface tension. To do this, we implement a spectrally resolved analysis of fluctuations over extremely long simulation times. This leads to more quantitative information on the topological sharpening effect, in which the degree of sharpening depends on the length scale over which it is measured. We compare our findings with a Brownian bridge model of the interface, and close by analyzing existing experimental data in support of the role of short-length-scale topological sharpening effects in real biological systems.</description>

      <title>Manipulating liquid-liquid phase separation using patterned flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise control of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is the key to developing cutting-edge technologies that benefit diverse disciplines. Fluid flow was found to be capable of controlling the structure and effective temperature of LLPS, but the extent and precision of control were less than optimal. In this article, we propose that patterned flow can be employed as a generic tool to manipulate LLPS effectively. By combining theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that flows with tailor-made structures can become functional, allowing us to control diverse aspects of LLPS. Typical examples include the capture and pinning of droplets, fine-tuning of droplet sizes, forced assembly of periodic droplet arrays, and the remodeling of the kinetics and structure of phase separation. These manipulations are grounded on the redistribution of chemical potential by the structured flow. Our results not only can lead to potential LLPS-based technologies, but also highlight the rich behavior of LLPS introduced by the patterned flow.</description>

      <title>Active Polar Ring Polymer in Shear Flow -- An Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the conformational and dynamical properties of semiflexible active polar ring polymers under linear shear flow. A ring is described as a continuous Gaussian polymer with a tangential active force of a constant density along its contour. The linear but non-Hermitian equation of motion is solved using an eigenfunction expansion, which yields activity-independent, but shear-rate-dependent, relaxation times and activity-dependent frequencies. As a consequence, the ring's stationary-state properties are independent of activity, and its conformations as well as rheological properties are equal to those of a passive ring under shear. The presence of characteristic time scales by the relaxation and the frequency gives rise to a particular dynamical behavior. A tank-treading-like motion emerges for large relaxation times and high frequencies, specifically for stiffer rings, governed by the activity-dependent frequencies. In the case of very flexible polymers, the relaxation behavior dominates over tank-treading. Shear strongly affects the crossover from a tank-treading to a relaxation-time dominated dynamics and suppresses tank-treading. This is reflected in the tumbling frequency, which exhibits two shear-rate dependent regimes, with an activity-dependent plateau at low shear rates followed by a power-law regime with increasing tumbling frequency for large shear rates.</description>

      <title>Predictability of viral load kinetics in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 through a model-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pipeline to evaluate the evolution of viral dynamics based on a new model-driven approach has been developed in the present study. The proposed methods exploit real data and the multiscale structure of the infection dynamics to provide robust predictions of the epidemic dynamics. We focus on viral load kinetics whose dynamical features are typically available in the symptomatic stage of the infection. Hence, the epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on a compartmental approach characterized by a varying infection rate to estimate early-stage viral load dynamics, of which few data are available. We test the proposed approach with real data of SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics collected from patients living in an Italian province. The considered database refers to early-phase infections, whose viral load kinetics are not affected by mass vaccination policies in Italy. Our contribution is devoted to provide an effective computational pipeline to evaluate in real time the evolution of infectivity. Comprehending the factors influencing the in-host viral dynamics represents a fundamental tool to provide robust public health strategies. This pilot study could be implemented in further investigations involving other respiratory viruses, to better clarify the process of viral dynamics as a preparatory action for future pandemics.</description>

      <title>Biophysical effects and neuromodulatory dose of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>

Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) has the potential to usher in a new era for human neuroscience by allowing spatially precise and high-resolution non-invasive targeting of both deep and superficial brain regions. Currently, fundamental research on the mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and neural tissues is progressing in parallel with application-focused research. However, a major hurdle in the wider use of TUS is the selection of optimal parameters to enable safe and effective neuromodulation in humans. In this paper, we will discuss the major factors that determine both the safety and efficacy of TUS. We will discuss the thermal and mechanical biophysical effects of ultrasound, which underlie its biological effects, in the context of their relationships with tunable parameters. Based on this knowledge of biophysical effects, and drawing on concepts from radiotherapy, we propose a framework for conceptualising TUS dose.</description>

      <title>The relationship between parameters and effects in transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is rapidly gaining traction for non-invasive human neuromodulation, with a pressing need to establish protocols that maximise neuromodulatory efficacy. In this review, we aggregate and examine empirical evidence for the relationship between tunable TUS parameters and in vitro and in vivo outcomes. Based on this multiscale approach, TUS researchers can make better informed decisions about optimal parameter settings. Importantly, we also discuss the challenges involved in extrapolating results from prior empirical work to future interventions, including the translation of protocols between models and the complex interaction between TUS protocols and the brain. A synthesis of the empirical evidence suggests that larger effects will be observed at lower frequencies within the sub-MHz range, higher intensities and pressures than commonly administered thus far, and longer pulses and pulse train durations. Nevertheless, we emphasise the need for cautious interpretation of empirical data from different experimental paradigms when basing protocols on prior work as we advance towards refined TUS parameters for human neuromodulation.</description>

      <title>Functions of Direct and Indirect Pathways for Action Selection Are Quantitatively Analyzed in A Spiking Neural Network of The Basal Ganglia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned about action selection in the basal ganglia (BG). We quantitatively analyze functions of direct pathway (DP) and indirect pathway (IP) for action selection in a spiking neural network with 3 competing channels. For such quantitative analysis, in each channel, we obtain the competition degree ${\cal C}_d$, given by the ratio of strength of DP (${\cal S}_{DP}$) to strength of IP (${\cal S}_{IP}$) (i.e., ${\cal C}_d = {\cal S}_{DP} / {\cal S}_{IP}$). Then, a desired action is selected in the channel with the largest ${\cal C}_d$. Desired action selection is made mainly due to strong focused inhibitory projection to the output nucleus, SNr (substantia nigra pars reticulata) via the DP in the corresponding channel. Unlike the case of DP, there are two types of IPs; intra-channel IP and inter-channel IP, due to widespread diffusive excitation from the STN (subthalamic nucleus). The intra-channel IP serves a function of brake to suppress the desired action selection. In contrast, the inter-channel IP to the SNr in the neighboring channels suppresses competing actions, leading to highlight the desired action selection. In this way, function of the inter-channel IP is opposite to that of the intra-channel IP. However, to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis for such functions of the DP and the two IPs was made. Here, through direct calculations of the DP and the intra- and the inter-channel IP presynaptic currents into the SNr in each channel, we obtain the competition degree of each channel to determine a desired action, and then functions of the DP and the intra- and inter-channel IPs are quantitatively made clear.</description>

      <title>Enantiospecificity in NMR Enabled by Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization in chiral molecules is a magnetic molecular response associated with electron transport and enantioselective bond polarization that occurs even in the absence of an external magnetic field. An unexpected finding by Santos and co-workers reported enantiospecific NMR responses in solid-state cross-polarization (CP) experiments, suggesting a possible additional contribution to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling in chiral molecules induced by bond polarization in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Herein we provide a theoretical treatment for this phenomenon, presenting an effective spin-Hamiltonian for helical molecules like DNA and density functional theory (DFT) results on amino acids that confirm the dependence of J-couplings on the choice of enantiomer. The connection between nuclear spin dynamics and chirality could offer insights for molecular sensing and quantum information sciences. These results establish NMR as a potential tool for chiral discrimination without external agents.</description>
