      <title>Spin Covariance Fluctuations in the SK Model at High Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on \cite{H}, it is well known that the rescaled two point correlation functions
  \[ \sqrt{N} \langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle = \sqrt{N} \big( \langle \sigma_i \sigma_j\rangle -\langle \sigma_i\rangle \langle \sigma_j\rangle\big) \] in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model with non-zero external field admit at sufficiently high temperature an explicit non-Gaussian distributional limit as $N\to \infty$. Inspired by recent results from \cite{ABSY, BSXY, BXY}, we provide a novel proof of the distributional convergence which is based on expanding $\langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle$ into a sum over suitable weights of self-avoiding paths from vertex $i$ to $j$. Compared to \cite{H}, our key observation is that the path representation of $\langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle$ provides a direct explanation of the specific form of the limiting distribution of $\sqrt{N} \langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle$.</description>

      <title>An Invariance Principle of 1D KPZ with Robin Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete one-dimensional random interface on the half-space whose height at any positive point is defined as a sum of an independent random noise and a function of the heights at its two closest neighbours. In 2022, Adhikari and Chatterjee proved for the full-space model that assuming the function is equivariant, symmetric, and at least six times differentiable in a neighbourhood of zero, as the variance of the noise variables goes to zero, the height function converges to the Cole-Hopf solution of the 1D KPZ equation under a parabolic rescaling on full space. In this paper, we obtained the same convergence result for such a random interface model with Robin boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>L\'evy processes resurrected in the positive half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A L\'evy processes resurrected in the positive half-line is a Markov process obtained by removing successively all jumps that make it negative. A natural question, given this construction, is whether the resulting process is absorbed at 0 or not. We first describe the law of the resurrected process in terms of that of the initial L\'evy process. Then in many important classes of L\'evy processes, we give conditions for absorption and conditions for non absorption bearing on the characteristics of the initial L\'evy process.</description>

      <title>Branching capacity of a random walk in $\mathbb Z^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the branching capacity of the range of a random walk in $\mathbb Z^d$.Schapira [28] has recently obtained precise asymptotics in the case $d\ge 6$ and has demonstrated a transition at dimension $d=6$. We study the case $d=5$ and prove that the renormalized branching capacity converges in law to the Brownian snake capacity of the range of a Brownian motion. The main step in the proof relies on studying the intersection probability between the range of a critical Branching random walk and that of a random walk, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a McKean-Vlasov (mean-field) stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by a Brownian sheet. We study the propagation of chaos for a space-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck SPDE type. Subsequently, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a nonlinear McKean-Vlasov SPDE. Finally, we establish a Fokker-Planck equation for the law of the solution of the McKean-Vlasov type SPDE driven by a time-space Brownian sheet, and we provide some examples to illustrate the results obtained.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov SDEs with density-dependent drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDE) whose drift depends pointwisely on marginal density and satisfies a condition about local integrability in time-space variables. The drift is assumed to be Lipschitz continuous in distribution variable with respect to Wasserstein metric $W_p$. Our approach is by approximation with mollified SDEs. We establish a new estimate about H{\"o}lder continuity in time of marginal density. Then we deduce that the marginal distributions (resp. marginal densities) of the mollified SDEs converge in $W_p$ (resp. topology of compact convergence) to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the density-dependent SDE. We prove strong existence of a solution. Weak and strong uniqueness are obtained when $p=1$, the drift coefficient is bounded, and the diffusion coefficient is distribution free.</description>

      <title>Catalan percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Catalan percolation, all nearest-neighbor edges $\{i,i+1\}$ along $\mathbb Z$ are initially occupied, and all other edges are open independently with probability $p$. Open edges $\{i,j\}$ are occupied if some pair of edges $\{i,k\}$ and $\{k,j\}$, with $i&lt;k&lt;j$, become occupied. This model was introduced by Gravner and the third author, in the context of polluted graph bootstrap percolation.
  We prove that the critical $p_{\mathrm c}$ is strictly between that of oriented site percolation on $\mathbb Z^2$ and the Catalan growth rate $1/4$. Our main result shows that an enhanced oriented percolation model, with non-decaying infinite-range dependency, has a strictly smaller critical parameter than the classical model. This is reminiscent of the work of Duminil-Copin, Hil\'ario, Kozma and Sidoravicius on brochette percolation. Our proof differs, however, in that we do not use Aizenman--Grimmett enhancements or differential inequalities. Two key ingredients are the work of Hil\'ario, S\'a, Sanchis and Teixeira on stretched lattices, and the Russo--Seymour--Welsh result for oriented percolation by Duminil-Copin, Tassion and Teixeira.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem for tensor products of free variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem for tensor product random variables $c_k:=a_k \otimes a_k$, where $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a free family of variables. We show that if the variables $a_k$ are centered, the limiting law is the semi-circle. Otherwise, the limiting law depends on the mean and variance of the variables $a_k$ and corresponds to a free interpolation between the semi-circle law and the classical convolution of two semi-circle laws.</description>

      <title>Specific Wasserstein divergence between continuous martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defining a divergence between the laws of continuous martingales is a delicate task, owing to the fact that these laws tend to be singular to each other. An important idea, put forward by N. Gantert, is to instead consider a scaling limit of the relative entropy between such continuous martingales sampled over a finite time grid. This gives rise to the concept of specific relative entropy. In order to develop a general theory of divergences between continuous martingales, it is only natural to replace the role of the relative entropy in this construction by a different notion of discrepancy between finite dimensional probability distributions. In the present work we take a first step in this direction, taking a power $p$ of the Wasserstein distance instead of the relative entropy. We call the newly obtained scaling limit the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence.
  In our first main result we prove that the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence is well-defined, and exhibit an explicit expression for it in terms of the quadratic variations of the martingales involved. This is obtained under vastly weaker assumptions than the corresponding results for the specific relative entropy. Next we illustrate the usefulness of the concept, by considering the problem of optimizing the specific $p$-Wasserstein divergence over the set of win-martingales. In our second main result we characterize the solution of this optimization problem for all $p&gt;0$ and, somewhat surprisingly, we single out the case $p=1/2$ as the one with the best probabilistic properties. For instance, the optimal martingale in this case is very explicit and can be connected, through a space transformation, to the solution of a variant of the Schr\"odinger problem.</description>

      <title>Non-explosion solutions for a class of stochastic physical diffusion oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in problems that are related to the physical phenomena of diffusion. We will focus on the theoretical aspect of the study, such as existence, uniqueness and non-explosive solutions. We will weaken the conditions imposed on the coefficients of the stochastic differential equations (SDE) that model some diffusion phenomena of mechanics. The work will be based on a general non-explosion criterion and we will obtain sufficient conditions so that the solution for a certain class of diffusions does not explode. We will construct Lyapunov functions that ensure the non-explosion of the solutions. Two important oscillators, namely the Duffing and the Van Der Pol oscillators, belong to this class. The Euler-Maruyama method is applied to these two oscillators to give us a simulation solution for them.</description>

      <title>Tail Asymptotic of Heavy-Tail Risks with Elliptical Copula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of multivariate distributions with heavy-tailed margins and the type I elliptical dependence structure. This class of risks is common in finance, insurance, environmental and biostatistic applications. We obtain the asymptotic tail risk probabilities and characterize the multivariate regular variation property. The results demonstrate how the rate of decay of probabilities on tail sets varies in tail sets and the covariance matrix of the elliptical copula. The theoretical results are well illustrated by typical examples and numerical simulations. A real data application shows its advantages in a more flexible dependence structure to characterize joint insurance losses.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the global existence of solutions to a system of stochastic Schr\"odinger equations with multiplicative noise. Our setting of the quadratic nonlinear terms in dimension 4 is $L^2$-critical. We treat the solutions under the ground state. We estimate the time derivative of the quantity of energy by using the cancellation of the cubic terms in the spatial derivative of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new general framework for metrization of Gromov-Hausdorff-type topologies on non-compact metric spaces. We also give easy-to-check conditions for separability and completeness and hence the measure theoretic requirements are provided to study convergence of random spaces with additional random objects. In particular, our framework enables us to define a metric inducing a suitable Gromov-Hausdorff-type topology on the space of rooted boundedly-compact metric spaces with laws of stochastic processes and/or random fields, which was not clear how to do in previous frameworks. In addition to general theory, this paper includes several examples of Gromov-Hausdorff-type topologies, verifying that classical examples such as the Gromov-Hausdorff topology and the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prohorov topology are contained within our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1309.5595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Hairer et. al (2012) showed that there exist SDEs with infinitely often differentiable and globally bounded coefficient functions whose solutions fail to be locally Lipschitz continuous in the strong L^p-sense with respect to the initial value for every p \in [1,\infty). In this article we provide sufficient conditions on the coefficient functions of the SDE and on p \in (0,\infty] which ensure local Lipschitz continuity in the strong L^p-sense with respect to the initial value and we establish explicit estimates for the local Lipschitz continuity constants. In particular, we prove local Lipschitz continuity in the initial value for several nonlinear SDEs from the literature such as the stochastic van der Pol oscillator, Brownian dynamics, the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes and the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook equation. As an application of our estimates, we obtain strong completeness for several nonlinear SDEs.</description>

      <title>BPHZ renormalisation and vanishing subcriticality asymptotics of the fractional $\Phi^3_d$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.13028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic PDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus with fractional Laplacian of parameter $\rho\in(0,2]$, quadratic nonlinearity and driven by space-time white noise. These equations are known to be locally subcritical, and thus amenable to the theory of regularity structures, if and only if $\rho &gt; d/3$. Using a series of recent results by the second named author, A. Chandra, I. Chevyrev, M. Hairer and L. Zambotti, we obtain precise asymptotics on the renormalisation counterterms as the mollification parameter $\varepsilon$ becomes small and $\rho$ approaches its critical value. In particular, we show that the counterterms behave like a negative power of $\varepsilon$ if $\varepsilon$ is superexponentially small in $(\rho-d/3)$, and are otherwise of order $\log(\varepsilon^{-1})$. This work also serves as an illustration of the general theory of BPHZ renormalisation in a relatively simple situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (S-K) spin glass model with external field, where the random symmetric couplings matrix does not consist of i.i.d. entries but is instead orthogonally invariant in law. For sufficiently high temperature, we prove a replica-symmetric formula for the first-order limit of the model free energy. Our analysis is an adaptation of a conditional second-moment-method argument previously introduced by Bolthausen for studying the high-temperature regime of the S-K model, where one conditions on the iterates of an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for solving the TAP equations for the model magnetization. We apply this method using a memory-free version of AMP that is tailored to the orthogonally invariant structure of the model couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of some McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations used to model the evolution of large populations of interacting agents. We give conditions ensuring the local stability of an invariant probability measure. Lions derivatives are used in a novel way to obtain our stability criteria. We obtain results for non-local McKean-Vlasov equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and for McKean-Vlasov equations on the torus where the interaction kernel is given by a convolution. On $\mathbb{R}^d$, we prove that the location of the roots of an analytic function determines the stability. On the torus, our stability criterion involves the Fourier coefficients of the interaction kernel. In both cases, we prove the convergence in the Wasserstein metric $W_1$ with an exponential rate of convergence.</description>

  \|f - \mathbb{E}f\|_2 \leq 12 \, T_{2}(X) \left(\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{h(t)}{t^{2}} \mathrm{dt} \right)^{1/2}
  \, \left(\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\|D_j f\|^{2}_2}{h\left( \log \frac{\|D_j f\|_2}{\|D_j f\|_1} \right)}\right)^{1/2} \end{align*} for all $f :\{-1,1\}^{n} \to X$ and all $n\geq 1$, where $X$ is a normed space and $T_{2}(X)$ is the associated type 2 constant.</description>

      <title>Infinite disorder renormalization fixed point for the continuum random field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the continuum version of the random field Ising model in one dimension: this model arises naturally as weak disorder scaling limit of the original Ising model. Like for the Ising model, a spin configuration is conveniently described as a sequence of spin domains with alternating signs (domain-wall structure). We show that for fixed centered external field and as spin-spin couplings become large, the domain-wall structure scales to a disorder dependent limit that coincides with the infinite disorder fixed point process introduced by D. S. Fisher in the context of zero temperature quantum Ising chains. In particular, our results establish a number of predictions that one can find in [Fisher, Le Doussal and Monthus 2001]. The infinite disorder fixed point process for centered external field is equivalently described in terms of the process of suitably selected extrema of a Brownian trajectory introduced and studied by J. Neveu and J. Pitman [Neveu and Pitman 1989]. This characterization of the infinite disorder fixed point is one of the important ingredients of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Liouville quantum gravity and CLE$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the first relationship between Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) phase, which corresponds to central charge values $\mathbf c_{\mathrm L} \in (1,25)$ or equivalently to complex values of $\gamma$ with $|\gamma|=2$. More precisely, we introduce a canonical supercritical LQG surface with the topology of the disk. We then show that for each $\mathbf c_{\mathrm L} \in (1,25)$ there is a coupling of this LQG surface with a conformal loop ensemble with parameter $\kappa=4$ (CLE$_4$) wherein the LQG surfaces parametrized by the regions enclosed by the CLE$_4$ loops are conditionally independent supercritical LQG disks given their boundary lengths. In this coupling, the CLE$_4$ is neither determined by nor independent from the LQG. Guided by our coupling result, we exhibit a combinatorially natural family of loop-decorated random planar maps whose scaling limit we conjecture to be the supercritical LQG disk coupled to CLE$_4$. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Cutting $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity by Schramm-Loewner evolution for $\kappa \not\in \{\gamma^2, 16/\gamma^2\}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many deep and useful theorems relating Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_\kappa$) and Liouville quantum gravity ($\gamma$-LQG) in the case when the parameters satisfy $\kappa \in \{\gamma^2, 16/\gamma^2\}$. Roughly speaking, these theorems say that the SLE$_\kappa$ curve cuts the $\gamma$-LQG surface into two or more independent $\gamma$-LQG surfaces. We extend these theorems to the case when $\kappa \not\in \{\gamma^2, 16/\gamma^2\}$. Roughly speaking we show that if we have an appropriate variant of SLE$_\kappa$ and an independent $\gamma$-LQG disk, then the SLE curve cuts the LQG disk into two or more $\gamma$-LQG surfaces which are conditionally independent given the values along the SLE curve of a certain collection of auxiliary imaginary geometry fields, viewed modulo conformal coordinate change. These fields are sampled independently from the SLE and the LQG and have the property that that the sum of the central charges associated with the SLE$_\kappa$ curve, the $\gamma$-LQG surface, and the auxiliary fields is 26. This condition on the central charge is natural from the perspective of bosonic string theory. We also prove analogous statements when the SLE curve is replaced by, e.g., an LQG metric ball or a Brownian motion path. Statements of this type were conjectured by Sheffield and are continuum analogs of certain Markov properties of random planar maps decorated by two or more statistical physics models. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

Abstract: We generalize McDiarmid's inequality for functions with bounded differences on a high probability set, using an extension argument. Those functions concentrate around their conditional expectations. We further extend the results to concentration in general metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Occupation time of a system of Brownian particles on the line with steplike initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of non-interacting Brownian particles on the line with steplike initial condition and study the statistics of the occupation time on the positive half-line. We demonstrate that this system exhibits long-lasting memory effects of the initialization. Specifically, we calculate the mean and the variance of the occupation time, demonstrating that the memory effects in the variance are determined by a generalized compressibility (or Fano factor), associated with the initial condition. In the particular case of the uncorrelated uniform initial condition we conduct a detailed study of two probability distributions of the occupation time: annealed (averaged over all possible initial configurations) and quenched (for a typical configuration). We show that at large times both the annealed and the quenched distributions admit large deviation form and we compute analytically the associated rate functions. We verify our analytical predictions via numerical simulations using Importance Sampling Monte-Carlo strategy.</description>

      <title>Behavioural pseudometrics for continuous-time diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bisimulation is a concept that captures behavioural equivalence of states in a variety of types of transition systems. It has been widely studied in a discrete-time setting where the notion of a step is fundamental. In our setting we are considering "flow"-processes emphasizing that they evolve in continuous time. In such continuous-time settings, the concepts are not straightforward adaptations of their discrete-time analogues and we restrict our study to diffusions that do not lose mass over time and with additional regularity constraints.
  In previous work we proposed different definitions of behavioural equivalences for continuous-time stochastic processes where the evolution is a flow through time. That work only addressed equivalences. In this work, we aim at quantifying how differently processes behave. We present two pseudometrics for diffusion-like processes. These pseudometrics are fixpoints of two different functionals on the space of 1-bounded pseudometrics on the state space. We also characterize these pseudometrics in terms of real-valued modal logics; this is a quantitative analogue of the notion of logical characterization of bisimulation. These real-valued modal logics indicate that the two pseudometrics are different and thus yield different notions of behavioural equivalence.</description>

      <title>The Unique stationary boundary property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. In this note we present an alternative proof to a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>
