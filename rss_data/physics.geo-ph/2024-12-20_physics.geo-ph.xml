      <title>Reciprocity-aware adaptive tile low-rank factorization for large-scale 3D multidimensional deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank regularization is an effective technique for addressing ill-posed inverse problems when the unknown variable exhibits low-rank characteristics. However, global low-rank assumptions do not always hold for seismic wavefields; in many practical situations, local low-rank features are instead more commonly observed. To leverage this insight, we propose partitioning the unknown variable into tiles, each represented via low-rank factorization.
  We apply this framework to regularize multidimensional deconvolution in the frequency domain, considering two key factors. First, the unknown variable, referred to as the Green's function, must maintain symmetry according to the reciprocity principle of wave propagation. To ensure symmetry within the tile-based low-rank framework, diagonal tiles are formulated as the product of a low-rank factor and its transpose if numerically rank-deficient. Otherwise, they are represented by preconditioned dense forms. Symmetry in off-diagonal elements is achieved by parameterizing sub-diagonal tiles as the product of two distinct low-rank factors, with the corresponding super-diagonal tiles set as their transposes.
  Second, the rank of the Green's function varies with frequency; in other words, the Green's function has different ranks at different frequencies. To determine the numerical rank and optimal tile size for each frequency, we first solve the multidimensional deconvolution problem using a benchmark solver. Based on these results, we estimate the optimal tile size and numerical rank for our proposed solver.</description>

      <title>Influence of ICME-driven Magnetic Cloud-like and Sheath Region induced Geomagnetic Storms in causing anomalous responses of the Low-latitude Ionosphere: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows an anomalously enhanced response of the low-latitude ionosphere over the Indian sector under weak geomagnetic conditions (October 31, 2021) in comparison to a stronger event (November 04, 2021) under the influence of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME)-driven Magnetic Cloud (MC)-like and sheath regions respectively. The investigation is based on measurements of the Total Electron Content (TEC) from Ahmedabad (23.06$^\circ$N, 72.54$^\circ$E, geographic; dip angle: 35.20$^\circ$), a location near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) over the Indian region. During the weaker event, the observed TEC from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), showed diurnal maximum enhancements of about 20 TECU over quiet-time variations, as compared to the stronger event where no such enhancements are present. It is shown that storm intensity (SYM-H) or magnitude of the southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) alone is unable to determine the ionospheric impacts of this space weather event. However, it is the non-fluctuating southward IMF and the corresponding penetration electric fields, for a sufficient interval of time, in tandem with the poleward neutral wind variations, that determines the strengthening of low-latitude electrodynamics of this anomalous event of October 31, 2021. Therefore, the present investigation highlights a case for further investigations of the important roles played by non-fluctuating penetration electric fields in determining a higher response of the low-latitude ionosphere even if the geomagnetic storm intensities are significantly low.</description>

      <title>Geomagnetic dipole stability and zonal flows controlled by mantle heat flux heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims at acquiring a more complete understanding of how lateral heterogeneities of the CMB heat flux affect the geodynamo while other relevant parameters are pushed towards realistic values. For this purpose, we ran geodynamo simulations with degree 1 and 2 spherical harmonic patterns of heat flux at the CMB. Several geodynamo models are used, ranging from standard numerical dynamos to more extreme parameters, including strong field cases and turbulent cases. We show that heat flux heterogeneities with amplitudes compatible with our knowledge of mantle convection history can favour multipolar dynamos. The multipolar transition is associated with a disruption of westward flows either through eastward thermal winds or through a loss of equatorial symmetry. Strong field dynamo models are found to have larger westward flows and are less sensitive to heat flux heterogeneities. Furthermore, we find that the dipolar fraction of the magnetic field correlates with $M_{Za}^*=\dfrac{\Lambda_{Za}}{Rm_{Za}^2}$ where $\Lambda_{Za}$ is the zonal antisymmetric Elsasser number and $Rm_{Za}$ is the zonal antisymmetric magnetic Reynolds number. Importantly, $M_{Za}^*$ estimated for the Earth's core is consistent with a reversing dipolar magnetic field. Within the range of $M_{Za}^*$ susceptible to reversals, breaking the equatorial symmetry or forcing eastward zonal flows through an equatorial cooling of the core consistently triggers reversals or a transition towards multipolar dynamos in our simulations. Our results support that time variations of heat-flux heterogeneities driven by mantle convection through Earth's history are capable of inducing the significant variations in the reversal frequency observed in the palaeomagnetic record.</description>
