      <title>Braiding on complex oriented Soergel bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study U(n) Soergel bimodules in the context of stable homotopy theory. We define the $(\infty, 1)$-category $\mathrm{SBim}_E(n)$ of $E$-valued U(n) Soergel bimodules, where $E$ is a connective $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring spectrum, and assemble them into a monoidal locally additive $(\infty, 2)$-category $\mathrm{SBim}_E$. When $E$ has a complex orientation, we then construct a braiding, i.e. an $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure, on the universal locally stable $(\infty, 2)$-category $\mathrm{K}^b_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathrm{SBim}_E)$ associated to $\mathrm{SBim}_E$. Along the way, we also prove spectral analogs of standard splittings of Soergel bimodules. This is a topological generalization of the type $A$ Soergel bimodule theory developed in a previous paper.</description>

      <title>Retractive spaces and Bousfield-Kan completions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper we apply some recent techniques developed by Schonsheck, and subsequently Carr-Harper, in the context of operadic algebras in spectra -- on convergence of Bousfield-Kan completions and comparisons with convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in Goodwillie's functor calculus -- to the setting of retractive spaces: this arises when working with spaces centered away from the one-point space. Interestingly, in the retractive spaces context, the comparison results are stronger in terms of convergence outside of functor calculus' notion of "radius of (strong) convergence" for analytic functors. In particular, we give a new proof (and generalization to retractive spaces) of the Arone-Kankaanrinta result for convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor to various Bousfield-Kan completions; it's notable that no use is made of Snaith splittings -- rather, we make extensive use of the kinds of homotopical estimates that appear in earlier work of Dundas and Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy.</description>

      <title>Global 2-rings and genuine refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a naive global 2-ring: a functor from the opposite of the $\infty$-category of global spaces to presentably symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-categories. By passing to global sections, every naive global 2-ring decategorifies to a multiplicative cohomology theory on global spaces, i.e. a naive global ring. We suggest when a naive global 2-ring deserves to be called \emph{genuine}. As evidence, we associate to such a global 2-ring a family of equivariant cohomology theories which satisfy a version of the change of group axioms introduced by Ginzburg, Kapranov and Vasserot. We further show that the decategorified multiplicative global cohomology theory associated to a genuine global $2$-ring canonically refines to an $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring object in global spectra. As we show, two interesting examples of genuine global 2-rings are given by quasi-coherent sheaves on the torsion points of an oriented spectral elliptic curve and Lurie's theory of tempered local systems. In particular, we obtain global spectra representing equivariant elliptic cohomology and tempered cohomology.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matching Complexes of Polygonal Line Tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perfect matching complex of a simple graph G is a simplicial complex having facets (maximal faces) as the perfect matchings of G. This article discusses the perfect matching complex of polygonal line tiling and the $\left(2 \times n\right)$-grid graph in particular. We use tools from discrete Morse theory to show that the perfect matching complex of any polygonal line tiling is either contractible or homotopically equivalent to a wedge of spheres. While proving our results, we also characterise all the matchings that can not be extended to form a perfect matching.</description>

      <title>Equivariant enumerative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate an equivariant conservation of number, which proves that a generalized Euler number of a complex equivariant vector bundle can be computed as a sum of local indices of an arbitrary section. This involves an expansion of the Pontryagin--Thom transfer in the equivariant setting. We leverage this result to commence a study of enumerative geometry in the presence of a group action. As an illustration of the power of this machinery, we prove that any smooth complex cubic surface defined by a symmetric polynomial has 27 lines whose orbit types under the $S_4$-action on $\mathbb{C}P^3$ are given by $[S_4/C_2]+[S_4/C_2'] + [S_4/D_8]$, where $C_2$ and $C_2'$ denote two non-conjugate cyclic subgroups of order two. As a consequence we demonstrate that a real symmetric cubic surface can only contain 3 or 27 real lines.</description>

      <title>Equivalences of the form $\Sigma^V X \simeq \Sigma^W X$ in equivariant stable homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study equivalences of the form $\Sigma^{V}X\simeq \Sigma^{W}X$, where $G$ is a compact Lie group, $X$ is a $G$-spectrum, and $V$ and $W$ are $G$-representations. These equivalences encode a periodicity phenomenon in $G$-equivariant homotopy theory which generalizes the classical James periodicity for $G = C_2$.
  When $X = C(a_\lambda)$ is the cofiber of an Euler class, we construct an $RO(G)$-graded $J$-homomorphism $J\colon \pi_\lambda KO_G\rightarrow \pi_\star^G C(a_\lambda)^\times$ which gives control over these periodicities. It also produces infinite periodic families in the $G$-equivariant stable stems. We illustrate this with several explicit examples.
  More generally, our work gives information about $RO(G)$-graded units in equivariant stable cohomotopy rings. We apply this to construct universal periodicities and differentials in the $G$-homotopy fixed point spectral sequence, and other equivariant Atiyah--Hirzebruch spectral sequences.</description>

      <title>Matching distance via the extended Pareto grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most animated themes of multidimensional persistence is the comparison between invariants. The matching distance between persistent Betti numbers functions (or rank invariants), is among the most studied metrics in this context, particularly in 2-parameter persistence. The main reason for this interest is that, in the 2-parameter case, the foliation method allows for an effective computation of the matching distance, based on filtering the space along lines of positive slope. Our work provides a qualitative analysis, based on a construction called extended Pareto grid, of the filtering lines that actually contribute to the computation of the matching distance. Under certain genericity assumptions, we show that these lines must either be horizontal, vertical, of slope 1 or belong to a finite collection of special lines associated with discontinuity phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building off of many recent advances in the subject by many different researchers, we describe a picture of A-equivariant chromatic homotopy theory which mirrors the now classical non-equivariant picture of Morava, Miller-Ravenel-Wilson, and Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith, where A is a finite abelian p-group. Specifically, we review the structure of the Balmer spectrum of the category of A-spectra, and the work of Hausmann-Meier connecting this to MU_A and equivariant formal group laws. Generalizing work of Bhattacharya-Guillou-Li, we introduce equivariant analogs of v_n-self maps, and generalizing work of Carrick and Balderrama, we introduce equivariant analogs of the chromatic tower, and give equivariant analogs of the smash product and chromatic convergence theorems. The equivariant monochromatic theory is also discussed. We explore computational examples of this theory in the case of A = C_2, where we connect equivariant chromatic theory with redshift phenomena in Mahowald invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make Hinich's $\infty$-categorical enriched Yoneda embedding natural. To do so, we exhibit it as the unit of a partial adjunction between the functor taking enriched presheaves and Heine's functor taking a tensored category to an enriched category. Furthermore, we study a finiteness condition of objects in a tensored category called being atomic, and show that the partial adjunction restricts to a (non-partial) adjunction between taking enriched presheaves and taking atomic objects.</description>

      <title>An algebraic criterion for the vanishing of bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients for many groups of interest in geometry, dynamics, and algebra. These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic K-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L\"oh; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.</description>

      <title>A double copy from twisted (co)homology at genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the twisted (co)homology of a family of genus-one integrals -- the so called Riemann-Wirtinger integrals. These integrals are closely related to one-loop string amplitudes in chiral splitting where one leaves the loop-momentum, modulus and all but one puncture un-integrated. While not actual one-loop string integrals, they share many properties and are simple enough that the associated twisted (co)homologies have been completely characterized [Goto2022,arXiv:2206.03177]. Using intersection numbers -- an inner product on the vector space of allowed differential forms -- we derive the Gauss-Manin connection for two bases of the twisted cohomology providing an independent check of [Mano&amp;Watanabe2012]. We also use the intersection index -- an inner product on the vector space of allowed contours -- to derive a double-copy formula for the closed-string analogues of Riemann-Wirtinger integrals (one-dimensional integrals over the torus). Similar to the celebrated KLT formula between open- and closed-string tree-level amplitudes, these intersection indices form a genus-one KLT-like kernel defining bilinears in meromorphic Riemann-Wirtinger integrals that are equal to their complex counterparts.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For all algebraic groups over non-Archimedean local fields, the bounded cohomology vanishes. This follows from the corresponding statement for automorphism groups of Bruhat--Tits buildings, which hinges on the solution to the flatmate conjecture raised in earlier work with Bucher. Vanishing and invariance theorems for arithmetic groups are derived.</description>
