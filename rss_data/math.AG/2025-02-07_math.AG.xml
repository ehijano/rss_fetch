      <title>Ultra-test ideals in rings with finitely generated anti-canonical algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When anti-canonical rings are finitely generated, we give a characterization of adjoint ideals using ultra-Frobenii, a characteristic zero analogue of Frobenius morphisms. This characterization enables us to give an alternative proof of a result of Zhuang, which states that if a ring is of klt type, then so is any of its pure subrings.</description>

      <title>Gotzmann's persistence theorem for Mori dream spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gotzmann's persistence theorem provides a method for determining the Hilbert polynomial of a subscheme of projective space by evaluating the Hilbert function at only two points, irrespective of the dimension of the ambient space. In arXiv:2405.02275 we established an analogue of Gotzmann's persistence theorem for smooth projective toric varieties. We generalise our results to the setting of Mori dream spaces, whose associated Cox rings are also finitely generated. We also give an alternative, stronger, persistence result for points in products of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Hodge microsheaves on cotangent bundles and plumbings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the category of Hodge microsheaves which is a Hodge-version of the category of microsheaves for a certain class of holomorphic exact symplectic manifolds. We then study Hodge-theoretic version of wrapped sheaves and discuss applications in topology and representation theory. Namely, we study (1) Hain's Hodge structures on the cohomology of based loop spaces of algebraic varieties, and (2) the Koszul duality of Ginzburg algebras by Etg\"u-Lekili from a mixed geometric perspective.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct decompositions of:
  (1) the cohomology of smooth stacks,
  (2) the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks, and
  (3) the vanishing cycle cohomology of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks,
  under the assumption that a good moduli space exists and the tangent space has a point-wise orthogonal structure. This holds for many moduli stacks of interest, such as the moduli stack of semistable $G$-bundles and (twisted) $G$-Higgs bundles on a curve and the $G$-character stacks of oriented closed 2-manifolds and various 3-manifolds.
  For smooth stacks, we show that their cohomology decomposes into the intersection cohomology of the good moduli space of the stack of graded points via the cohomological Hall induction map. This generalizes and provides a new proof of Meinhardt--Reineke's theorem identifying the cohomological BPS invariant for symmetric quivers with the intersection cohomology of the good moduli space.
  For $0$-shifted symplectic stacks, we define a pure Hodge module on the good moduli space, the BPS sheaf, and prove that the Borel--Moore homology of the stack decomposes into the cohomology of the BPS sheaves on the good moduli space of the stack of graded points. As an application, we propose a formulation of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for $G$-Higgs bundles for semisimple groups $G$ in the style of Hausel--Thaddeus.
  For $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks, we introduce a mixed Hodge module, also referred to as the BPS sheaf, and prove a decomposition theorem analogous to the one for $0$-shifted symplectic stacks, but now for the vanishing cycle cohomology. As a particular case, we establish the cohomological integrality theorem for $3$-Calabi--Yau categories admitting a certain orientation data, generalizing the result of Davison and Meinhardt for quivers with potentials.</description>

      <title>Type II Degenerations of K3 Surfaces of Degree 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Type II degenerations of K3 surfaces of degree 4 where the central fiber consists of two rational components glued along an elliptic curve. Such degenerations are called Tyurin degenerations. We construct explicit Tyurin degenerations corresponding to each of the 1-dimensional boundary components of the Baily-Borel compactification of the moduli space of K3 surfaces of degree 4. For every such boundary component we also construct an 18-dimensional family of Tyurin degenerations of K3 surfaces of degree 4 and compute the stable models of these degenerations.</description>

      <title>Fenchel's conjecture on NEC groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical discovery known as Fenchel's conjecture and proved in the 1950s, shows that every co-compact Fuchsian group $F$ has a normal subgroup of finite index isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact unbordered orientable surface, or in algebraic terms, that $F$ has a normal subgroup of finite index that contains no element of finite order other than the identity. In this paper we initiate and make progress on an extension of Fenchel's conjecture by considering the following question: Does every planar non-Euclidean crystallographic group $\Gamma$ containing transformations that reverse orientation have a normal subgroup of finite index isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact unbordered non-orientable surface? We answer this question in the affirmative in the case where the orbit space of $\Gamma$ is a nonorientable surface, and also in the case where this orbit space is a bordered orientable surface of positive genus. In the case where the genus of the quotient is $0$, we have an affirmative answer in many subcases, but the question is still open for others.</description>

      <title>Modular companions in planar one-dimensional equisymmetric strata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider, in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of a fixed genus, the subset of surfaces with non-trivial automorphisms. Of special interest are the numerous subsets of surfaces admitting an action of a given finite group, $G$, acting with a specific signature. In a previous study we declared two Riemann surfaces to be \emph{modular companions} if they have topologically equivalent $G$ actions, and that their $G$ quotients are conformally equivalent orbifolds. In this article we present a geometrically-inspired measure to decide whether two modular companions are conformally equivalent (or how different), respecting the $G$ action. Along the way, we construct a moduli space for surfaces with the specified $G$ action and associated equivariant tilings on these surfaces. We specifically apply the ideas to planar, finite group actions whose quotient orbifold is a sphere with four cone points.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of inverse limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the category of nuclear modules on an affine formal scheme as defined by Clausen and Scholze \cite{CS20}. We also study related constructions in the framework of dualizable and rigid monoidal categories. We prove that the $K$-theory (in the sense of \cite{E24}) of the category of nuclear modules on $\operatorname{Spf}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ is isomorphic to the classical continuous $K$-theory, which in the noetherian case is given by the limit $\varprojlim\limits_{n} K(R/I^n).$ This isomorphism was conjectured previously by Clausen and Scholze.
  More precisely, we study two versions of the category of nuclear modules: the original one defined in \cite{CS20} and a different version, which contains the original one as a full subcategory. For our category $\operatorname{Nuc}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ we give three equivalent definitions. The first definition is by taking the internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in the category $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}$ of $R$-linear dualizable categories. The second definition is by taking the rigidification of the usual $I$-complete derived category of $R.$ The third definition is by taking an inverse limit in $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}.$ For each of the three approaches we prove that the corresponding construction is well-behaved in a certain sense.
  Moreover, we prove that the two versions of the category of nuclear modules have the same $K$-theory, and in fact the same finitary localizing invariants.</description>

      <title>Categorifying non-commutative deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.03084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the functor $\textrm{ncDef}_{(Z_1,\ldots,Z_n)}$ of non-commutative deformations of an $n$-tuple of objects in an arbitrary $k$-linear abelian category $\mathcal{Z}$. In our categorified approach, we view the underlying spaces of infinitesimal flat deformations as Deligne finite categories, i.e. finite length abelian categories admitting projective generators, with $n$ isomorphism classes of simple objects.
  More generally, we define the functor $\textrm{ncDef}_{\zeta}$ of non-commutative deformations of an exact functor $\zeta \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{Z}$ of abelian categories. Here the role of an infinitesimal non-commutative thickening of $\mathcal{A}$ is played by an abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ containing $\mathcal{A}$ and such that $\mathcal{A}$ generates $\mathcal{B}$ by extensions. The functor $\textrm{ncDef}_{\zeta}$ assigns to such $\mathcal{B}$ the set of equivalence classes of exact functors $\mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{Z}$ which extend $\zeta$. We prove that an exact functor on an infinitesimal extension is fully faithful if and only if it is fully faithful on the first infinitesimal neighbourhood.
  We show that if $\zeta$ is fully faithful, then the functor $\textrm{ncDef}_{\zeta}$ is ind-represented by the extension closure of the essential image of $\zeta$.
  We prove that for a flopping contraction $f\colon X\to Y$ with the fiber over a closed point $C = \bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i$, where $C_i$'s are irreducible curves, $\{\mathcal{O}_{C_i}(-1)\}$ is the set of simple objects in the null-category for $f$. We conclude that the null-category ind-represents the functor $\textrm{ncDef}_{(\mathcal{O}_{C_1}(-1),\ldots,\mathcal{O}_{C_n}(-1))}$.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with trivial Chern classes II: Manifolds Isogenous to a Torus Product, coframed Manifolds and a question by Baldassarri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a general question addressed by Mario Baldassarri in 1956, we discuss characterizations of the Pseudo-Abelian Varieties introduced by Roth, and we introduce a first new notion, of Manifolds Isogenous to a k-Torus Product: the latter have the last k Chern classes trivial in rational cohomology and vanishing Chern numbers. We show that in dimension 2 the latter class is the correct substitute for some incorrect assertions by Enriques, Dantoni, Roth and Baldassarri: these are the surfaces with $K_X$ nef and $c_2(X)=0 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$. We observe in the last section, using a construction by Chad Schoen, that such a simple similar picture does not hold in higher dimension. We discuss then, as a class of solutions to Baldassarri's question, manifolds isogenous to projective (respectively: K\"ahler) manifolds whose tangent bundle or whose cotangent bundle has a trivial subbundle of positive rank. We see that the class of `partially framed' projective manifolds (that is, whose tangent bundle has a trivial subbundle) consists, in the case where $K_X$ is nef, of the Pseudo-Abelian varieties of Roth; while the class of `partially co-framed' projective manifolds is not yet fully understood in spite of the new results that we are able to show here: and we formulate some open questions and conjectures. In the course of the paper we address also the case of more general compact complex Manifolds, introducing the new notions of suspensions over parallelizable Manifolds, of twisted hyperelliptic Manifolds, and we describe the known results under the K\"ahler assumption.</description>

Abstract: We present the Julia package ToricAtiyahBott.jl, providing an easy way to perform the Atiyah-Bott formula on the moduli space of genus $0$ stable maps $\overline{M}_{0,m}(X,\beta)$ where $X$ is any smooth projective toric variety, and $\beta$ is any effective $1$-cycle. The list of the supported cohomological cycles contains the most common ones, and it is extensible. We provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm together with many examples and applications. The toric variety $X$, as well as the cohomology class $\beta$, must be defined using the package Oscar.jl.</description>

Abstract: We say that a line in $\mathbb P^{n+1}_k$ is osculating to a hypersurface $Y$ if they meet with contact order $n+1$. When $k=\mathbb C$, it is known that through a fixed point of $Y$, there are exactly $n!$ of such lines. Under some parity condition on $n$ and $\mathrm{deg}(Y)$, we define a quadratically enriched count of these lines over any perfect field $k$. The count takes values in the Grothendieck--Witt ring of quadratic forms over $k$ and depends linearly on $\mathrm{deg}(Y)$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the crepant transformation conjecture for relative Grassmann flops over a smooth base $B$. We show that the $I$-functions of the respective GIT quotients are related by analytic continuation and a symplectic transformation. We verify that the symplectic transformation is compatible with Iritani's integral structure, that is, that it is induced by a Fourier-Mukai transform in $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>On the generic injectivity of Hessian maps of ternary forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of the generic injectivity of the
  Hessian map, associating with a proportionality class of a ternary form the class of its Hessian determinant, conjectured
  by C. Ciliberto and G. Ottaviani and recently proved by the same authors.
  Taking into account that the Hessian curve is the ramification divisor associated with the polar map,
  we perform a study of the problem using a geometric description of the graph of such a map.</description>

      <title>Semistable degenerations of double octics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for computing semistable degeneration of double octic Calabi-Yau threefolds. Our method has a combinatorial representation by the means of double octic diagrams. The proposed algorithm is applicable both in classical context over a complex disk as well as in arithmetic setting over a spectrum of DVR. We illustrate algorithm's efficacy through three examples where we compute semistable degeneration and limiting mixed Hodge structure for explicit families of double octics.</description>

      <title>On combinatorics of plus-one generated line arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we focus on combinatorial aspects of plus-one generated line arrangements. We provide combinatorial constraints on such arrangements and we construct a polynomial that decodes the plus-one generated property. We present new examples of plus-one generated arrangements constructed by using classical Klein and Wiman reflection arrangements, and we detect, among all known sporadic simplicial arrangements up to $27$ lines, exactly $9$ arrangements that are minimal plus-one generated.</description>

      <title>A note on the Casas-Alvero Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08742v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casas--Alvero conjecture predicts that every univariate polynomial $f$ over a field $K$ of characteristic zero having a common factor with each of its derivatives $H_i(f)$ is a power of a linear polynomial. Let $f=x^d+a_1x^{d-1}+\cdots+a_1x \in K[a_1,\ldots,a_{d-1}][x]$ and let $R_i = Res(f,H_i(f))\in K[a_1,\ldots,a_{d-1}]$ be the resultant of $f$ and $H_i(f)$, $i \in \{1,\ldots,d-1\}$. The Casas-Alvero Conjecture is equivalent to saying that $R_1,\ldots,R_{d-1}$ are ``independent'' in a certain sense, namely that the height $ht(R_1,\ldots,R_{d-1})=d-1$ in $K[a_1,\ldots,a_{d-1}]$. In this paper we prove a very partial result in this direction : if $i \in \{d-3,d-2,d-1\}$ then $R_i \notin \sqrt{(R_1,\ldots,\breve{R_i},\ldots,R_{d-1}}$.</description>

      <title>K-theory and localizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram24a} on the $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariant theory and stretched Kostka quasi-polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $G$ a semisimple, simply-connected complex algebraic group and two dominant integral weights $\lambda, \mu$, we consider the dimensions of weight spaces $V_\lambda(\mu)$ of weight $\mu$ in the irreducible, finite-dimensional highest weight $\lambda$ representation. For natural numbers $N$, the function $N \mapsto \dim V_{N\lambda}(N\mu)$ is a quasi-polynomial in $N$, the stretched Kostka quasi-polynomial. Using methods of geometric invariant theory (GIT), we realize the degree of this quasi-polynomial as the dimension of a certain GIT quotient. As a result, we resolve a conjecture of Gao and Gao on an explicit formula for this degree. We also discuss periods of this quasi-polynomial determined by the GIT approach, and give computational evidence supporting a geometric determination of the minimal period.</description>
