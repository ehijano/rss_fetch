      <title>Pricing and hedging of decentralised lending contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the loan contracts offered by decentralised loan protocols (DLPs) through the lens of financial derivatives. DLPs, which effectively are clearinghouses, facilitate transactions between option buyers (i.e. borrowers) and option sellers (i.e. lenders). The loan-to-value at which the contract is initiated determines the option premium borrowers pay for entering the contract, and this can be deduced from the non-arbitrage pricing theory. We show that when there are no market frictions, and there is no spread between lending and borrowing rates, it is optimal to never enter the lending contract.
  Next, by accounting for the spread between rates and transactional costs, we develop a deep neural network-based algorithm for learning trading strategies on the external markets that allow us to replicate the payoff of the lending contracts that are not necessarily optimally exercised. This allows hedge the risk lenders carry by issuing options sold to the borrowers, which can complement (or even replace) the liquidations mechanism used to protect lenders' capital. Our approach can also be used to exploit (statistical) arbitrage opportunities that may arise when DLP allow users to enter lending contracts with loan-to-value, which is not appropriately calibrated to market conditions or/and when different markets price risk differently. We present thorough simulation experiments using historical data and simulations to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Peer-induced Fairness: A Causal Approach for Algorithmic Fairness Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act taking effect on 1 August 2024, high-risk AI applications must adhere to stringent transparency and fairness standards. This paper addresses a crucial question: how can we scientifically audit algorithmic fairness? Current methods typically remain at the basic detection stage of auditing, without accounting for more complex scenarios. We propose a novel framework, ``peer-induced fairness'', which combines the strengths of counterfactual fairness and peer comparison strategy, creating a reliable and robust tool for auditing algorithmic fairness. Our framework is universal, adaptable to various domains, and capable of handling different levels of data quality, including skewed distributions. Moreover, it can distinguish whether adverse decisions result from algorithmic discrimination or inherent limitations of the subjects, thereby enhancing transparency. This framework can serve as both a self-assessment tool for AI developers and an external assessment tool for auditors to ensure compliance with the EU AI Act. We demonstrate its utility in small and medium-sized enterprises access to finance, uncovering significant unfairness-41.51% of micro-firms face discrimination compared to non-micro firms. These findings highlight the framework's potential for broader applications in ensuring equitable AI-driven decision-making.</description>
