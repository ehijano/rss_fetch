      <title>Flame Transfer Function Measurement of a Hydrogen-Blended Sequential Combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flame transfer function (FTF) relates acoustic perturbations and the coherent heat release rate response. This frequency-dependent function governs the thermoacoustic stability of a combustor. The FTF measurement is therefore of great interest for predicting the stability of the a practical combustor connected to the engine's compressor and turbine. In this study, the flame transfer function of the sequential flame of an atmospheric constant pressure sequential combustor (CPSC) is experimentally measured. The thermal power of both the first- and second-stage flames is kept constant and their ratio is fixed at 1:1. The effects of hydrogen blending in the first and second stage fuel mixture on the sequential FTF are analyzed. The FTF of the sequential flame is fitted with a distributed time delay (DTD) model with two pulses. The trends of the model parameters obtained are consistent with the chemiluminescence OH* of the sequential flame.</description>

      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity (PV) based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by $O(f)$ vorticity and convergence, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward elliptic problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ as a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bubble collapse near a wall. Part 1: An experimental study on the impact of shock waves and microjet on the wall pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03479v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the pressure exerted by a cavitation bubble collapsing near a rigid wall. A laser-generated bubble in a water basin undergoes growth, collapse, second growth, and final collapse. Shock waves and liquid jets from non-spherical collapses are influenced by the stand-off ratio ${\gamma}$, defined as the bubble centroid distance from the wall divided by the bubble radius. We detail shock mechanisms, such as tip or torus collapse, for various ${\gamma}$ values. High-speed and Schlieren imaging visualize the microjet and shock waves. The microjet's evolution is tracked for large ${\gamma}$, while shock waves are captured in composite images showing multiple shock positions. Quantitative analyses of the microjet interface, shock wave velocities, and impact times are reported. Wall-mounted sensors and a needle hydrophone measure pressure and compare with high-speed observations to assess the dominant contributions to pressure changes with ${\gamma}$, revealing implications for cavitation erosion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Pensive billiards, point vortices, and pucks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by M.Bialy, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, governing quintessential hydrodynamics functions, like lubrication, stability and cargo transport. It is shown here how a magnetic force field at a magnetic-nonmagnetic fluid interface results in an ultra-soft interface with nonlinear elasticity and tunable viscous shear properties. The balance between magnetic pressure, viscous stress and Laplace pressure results in a deformed and stable liquid-in-liquid tube with apparent elasticity in the range 2 kPa -10 kPa, possibly extended by a proper choice of liquid properties. Such highly deformable liquid-liquid interfaces of arbitrary shape with vanishing viscous shear open doors to unique microfluidic phenomena, biomaterial flows and complex biosystems mimicking.</description>

      <title>A TVD neural network closure and application to turbulent combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trained neural networks (NN) have attractive features for closing governing equations, but in the absence of additional constraints, they can stray from physical reality. A NN formulation is introduced to preclude spurious oscillations that violate solution boundedness or positivity. It is embedded in the discretized equations as a machine learning closure and strictly constrained, inspired by total variation diminishing (TVD) methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. The constraint is exactly enforced during gradient-descent training by rescaling the NN parameters, which maps them onto an explicit feasible set. Demonstrations show that the constrained NN closure model usefully recovers linear and nonlinear hyperbolic phenomena and anti-diffusion while enforcing the non-oscillatory property. Finally, the model is applied to subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling of a turbulent reacting flow, for which it suppresses spurious oscillations in scalar fields that otherwise violate the solution boundedness. It outperforms a simple penalization of oscillations in the loss function.</description>

      <title>Scale-to-Scale Information Flow Amplifies Turbulent Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In three-dimensional turbulence, information of turbulent fluctuations at large scales is propagated to small scales. Here, we investigate the relation between the information flow and turbulent fluctuations. We first establish a connection between the information flow and phase-space contraction rate. From this relation, we then prove a universal inequality between the information flow and turbulent fluctuations, which states that the information flow from large to small scales amplifies turbulent fluctuations at small scales. This inequality can also be interpreted as a quantification of Landau's objection to the universality of turbulent fluctuations. We also discuss the difference between the information flow and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric deformations of a perturbed spherical bubble in an incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a gas bubble in a fluid with surface tension, initially near a spherical equilibrium. While there are many studies and applications of radial bubble dynamics, the theory of general deformations from a spherical equilibrium is less developed. We aim to understand how asymmetrically perturbed equilibrium bubbles evolve toward spherical equilibrium due to thermal or viscous dissipation in an incompressible liquid. We focus on the isobaric approximation [Prosperetti, JFM, 1991], under which the gas pressure within the bubble is spatially uniform and obeys the ideal gas law. The liquid outside the bubble is incompressible, irrotational, and has surface tension. We prove that any equilibrium gas bubble must be spherical by showing that the bubble boundary is a closed surface of constant mean curvature. We then study the initial value problem (IVP) for the coupled PDEs, constitutive laws and interface conditions of the isobaric approximation for general (asymmetric) small initial perturbations of the spherical bubble in the linearized approximation. Our first result, considering thermal damping without viscosity, proves that the linearized IVP is globally well-posed. The monopole (radial) component of the perturbation decays exponentially over time, while the multipole (non-radial) components undergo undamped oscillations. This indicates a limitation of the isobaric model for non-spherical dynamics. Our second result, incorporating viscous dissipation, shows that the IVP is linear and nonlinearly ill-posed due to an incompatibility of normal stress boundary conditions, for non-spherical solutions, and the irrotationality assumption. Our study concludes that to accurately capture the dynamics of general deformations of a gas bubble, the model must account for either vorticity generated at the bubble-fluid boundary, spatial non-uniformities in the gas pressure, or both.</description>

      <title>Computational Identification and Stuart-Landau Modeling of Collective Dynamical Behaviors of Octuple Laminar Diffusion Flame Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Annular chambers, consisting of multiple flame nozzles, are frequently used in many industrial processes, for example, rocket engines and gas turbines. In the study, we proposed a novel approach to the problem of annular combustion with emphasis on the collective dynamical behaviors that its individuals do not have. A series of circular arrays of octuple flickering laminar buoyant diffusion flames were investigated computationally and theoretically. Five distinct dynamical modes, such as the merged, in-phase mode, rotation, flickering death, partially flickering death, and anti-phase modes, were computationally identified and interpreted from the perspective of vortex dynamics. A unified regime diagram was obtained in terms of the normalized flame frequency f/f_0 and the combined parameter ({\alpha}-1)Gr^1/2, where {\alpha}=l/D is the ratio of the flame separation distance l to the flame nozzle diameter D and Gr is the Grashof number. The bifurcation transition from the in-phase mode and the anti-phase mode to the totally or partially flickering death occurs at ({\alpha}-1)Gr^1/2=655+-55. In addition, a Stuart-Landau model with a time-delay coupling was utilized to reproduce the general features and collective modes of the octuple oscillators flame systems.</description>

      <title>CFD analysis of electroviscous effects in electrolyte liquid flow through heterogeneously charged uniform microfluidic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study has numerically investigated the charge-heterogeneity effects in the electroviscous flow of symmetric ($1$:$1$) electrolyte liquid through a uniform slit microfluidic device. The Poisson's, Nernst-Planck (N-P), Navier-Stokes (N-S), and continuity equations are solved using the finite element method (FEM) to obtain the flow fields, such as total electrical potential ($U$), excess charge ($n^\ast$), induced electric field strength ($E_\text{x}$), and pressure ($P$) fields for following conditions: inverse Debye length ($2\le K\le 20$), surface charge density ($4\le \mathit{S_\text{1}}\le 16$), and surface charge-heterogeneity ratio ($0\le \mathit{S_\text{rh}}\le 2$). Results have shown that the total potential ($|\Delta U|$) and pressure ($|\Delta P|$) drop maximally increase by 99.09% (at $K=20$, $\mathit{S_\text{1}}=4$) and 12.77% (at $K=2$, $\mathit{S_\text{1}}=8$), respectively with overall charge-heterogeneity ($0\le \mathit{S_\text{rh}}\le 2$). Electroviscous correction factor (i.e., the ratio of effective to physical viscosity) maximally enhances by 12.77% (at $K=2$, $\mathit{S_\text{1}}=8$), 40.98% (at $\mathit{S_\text{1}}=16$, $\mathit{S_\text{rh}}=1.50$), and 41.35% (at $K=2$, $\mathit{S_\text{rh}}=1.50$), with the variation of $\mathit{S_\text{rh}}$ (from 0 to 2), $K$ (from 20 to 2), and $\mathit{S_\text{1}}$ (from 0 to 16), respectively. Further, a simple pseudo-analytical model is developed to estimate the pressure drop in the electroviscous (EV) flow, accounting for the influence of charge-heterogeneity based on the Poiseuille flow in the uniform channel. This model predicts the pressure drop $\pm$2-4% within the numerical results. The robustness and simplicity of this model enable the present numerical results for engineering and design aspects of microfluidic applications.</description>

      <title>Multiple states of two-dimensional turbulence above topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent work of Siegelman \&amp; Young (PNAS, vol. 120(44), 2023, pp. e2308018120) revealed two extreme states reached by the evolution of unforced and weakly-damped two-dimensional turbulence above random rough topography, separated by a critical kinetic energy $E_\#$. The low- and high-energy solutions correspond to topographically-locked and roaming vortices, surrounded by non-uniform and homogeneous background potential vorticity (PV), respectively. However, we found that these phenomena are restricted to the particular intermediate length scale where the energy was initially injected into the system. Through simulations initialised by injecting the energy at larger and smaller length scales, we found that the long-term state of topographic turbulence is also dependent on the initial length scale and thus the initial enstrophy. If the initial length scale is comparable with the domain size, the long-term flow field resembles the minimum-enstrophy state proposed by Bretherton \&amp; Haidvogel (J. Fluid Mech., vol.78(1), 1976, pp. 129-154), with very few topographically-locked vortices; the long-term enstrophy is quite close to the minimum value, especially when the energy is no larger than $E_\#$. As the initial length scale becomes smaller, more vortices nucleate and become more mobile; the long-term enstrophy increasingly deviates from the minimum value. Simultaneously, the background PV tends to homogenization, even if the energy is below $E_\#$. These results complement the phenomenology of topographic turbulence documented by Siegelman \&amp; Young, by showing that the minimum-enstrophy and background PV homogenization states can be adequately approached by large- and small-scale initial fields, respectively, with relatively arbitrary energy.</description>

      <title>Novel Pressure-Equilibrium and Kinetic-Energy Preserving fluxes for compressible flows based on the harmonic mean</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing physically-consistent numerical methods is an important step towards attaining robust and accurate numerical simulations. When addressing compressible flows, in addition to preserving kinetic energy at a discrete level, as done in the incompressible case, additional properties are sought after, such as the ability to preserve the equilibrium of pressure that can be found at contact interfaces. This paper investigates the general conditions of the spatial numerical discretizations to achieve the pressure equilibrium preserving property (PEP). Schemes from the literature are analyzed in this respect, and procedures to impart the PEP property to existing discretizations are proposed. Additionally, new PEP numerical schemes are introduced through minor modifications of classical ones. Numerical tests confirmed the theory hereby presented and showed that the modifications, beyond the enforcement of the PEP property, have a generally positive impact on the performances of the original schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortices and their analysis play a critical role in the understanding of complex phenomena in turbulent flows. Traditional vortex extraction methods, notably region-based techniques, often overlook the entanglement phenomenon, resulting in the inclusion of multiple vortices within a single extracted region. Their separation is necessary for quantifying different types of vortices and their statistics. In this study, we propose a novel vortex separation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation approach with an additional step termed "layering". Upon extracting a vortical region using specified vortex criteria (e.g., $\lambda_2$), we initially establish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the layering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells, thus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions may still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by leveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of vortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled porous media from particle-stabilized emulsions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1408.2974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to create self-assembled porous media with highly tunable geometrical properties and permeabilities: We first allow a particle-stabilized emulsion to form from a mixture of two fluids and colloidal particles. Then, either one fluid phase or the particle layer is solidified, which can be achieved by techniques such as polymerization or freezing. Based on computer simulations we demonstrate that modifying only the particle wettability or concentration results in porous structures with a wide range of pore sizes and a permeability that can be varied by up to three orders of magnitude. We then discuss optimization of these properties for self-assembled filters or reactors and conclude that structures based on so-called "bijels" are most suitable candidates.</description>

      <title>MetaOpenFOAM: an LLM-based multi-agent framework for CFD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remarkable progress has been made in automated problem solving through societies of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as a complex problem, presents unique challenges in automated simulations that require sophisticated solutions. MetaOpenFOAM, as a novel multi-agent collaborations framework, aims to complete CFD simulation tasks with only natural language as input. These simulation tasks include mesh pre-processing, simulation and so on. MetaOpenFOAM harnesses the power of MetaGPT's assembly line paradigm, which assigns diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex CFD tasks into manageable subtasks. Langchain further complements MetaOpenFOAM by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, which enhances the framework's ability by integrating a searchable database of OpenFOAM tutorials for LLMs. Tests on a benchmark for natural language-based CFD solver, consisting of eight CFD simulation tasks, have shown that MetaOpenFOAM achieved a high pass rate per test (85%), with each test case costing only $0.22 on average. The eight CFD simulation tasks encompass a range of multidimensional flow problems, covering compressible and incompressible flows with different physical processes. This demonstrates the capability to automate CFD simulations using only natural language input, iteratively correcting errors to achieve the desired simulations. An ablation study was conducted to verify the necessity of each component in the multi-agent system and the RAG technology. A sensitivity study on the randomness of LLM showed that LLM with low randomness can obtain more stable and accurate results. Additionally, MetaOpenFOAM owns the ability to identify and modify key parameters in user requirements, and excels in correcting bugs when failure match occur,which demonstrates the generalization of MetaOpenFOAM.</description>
