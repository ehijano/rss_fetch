      <title>A Molecular Beam Study of the (0,0) A2\Pi &lt;- X2\Sigma+ Band of CaF Isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an experimental determination of spectroscopic parameters for the less-abundant isotopologues $^{42}$CaF and $^{44}$CaF, alongside $^{40}$CaF, using high-resolution laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy in a skimmed free jet expansion. We recorded spectra near the natural linewidth limit and derived spectroscopic constants for both the $X^2\Sigma^+$ and $A^2\Pi$ electronic states, including the fine and $^{19}$F magnetic hyperfine parameters. We also estimated the isotope amount ratio $r(^{44}\mathrm{Ca}/^{40}\mathrm{Ca})$, demonstrating the potential use of optical spectroscopy for calcium isotope analysis.</description>

      <title>Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy on dry Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends reinforced with Nano-Graphene Platelets at combined pressure and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends at mass ratio 3:1 with Nano - Graphene Platelet fillers constitute mechanically and thermally stable systems, which are used for developing piezoelectric devices. Blends host a fraction of water molecules absorbed by the poly(vinyl alcohol) phase. Dc conductivity and dielectric relaxation occur via fluctuation induced tunneling of electrons. Electric charge transport is affected by the glass transition of the polymer matrix and the rotational and translational dynamics of absorbed water molecules. In the present work, absorbed water was subtracted by annealing and pumping and, subsequently, dry blends were characterized by employing Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy at combined temperature and pressure states. Conductivity and relaxation obey fluctuation induced tunneling temperature dependencies. The corresponding activation energies and activation volumes reveal the role of absorbed polar water molecules on the tunneling current for macroscopic or localized electron transport.</description>

      <title>Towards Improved Quantum Machine Learning for Molecular Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) for generating molecular force fields, focusing on the rMD17 dataset. We consider a QNN architecture based on previous research and point out shortcomings in the parametrization of the atomic environments, that limits its expressivity as an interatomic potential and precludes transferability between molecules. We propose a revised QNN architecture that addresses these shortcomings. While both QNNs show promise in force prediction, with the revised architecture showing improved accuracy, they struggle with energy prediction. Further, both QNNs architectures fail to demonstrate a meaningful scaling law of decreasing errors with increasing training data. These findings highlight the challenges of scaling QNNs for complex molecular systems and emphasize the need for improved encoding strategies, regularization techniques, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Pump-Push Molecular Dynamics in the Heptazine-H2O Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-push-probe spectroscopy was employed for the exploration of charge-separation processes in organic photovoltaic blends as well as for proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) reactions in hydrogen-bonded complexes of tri-anisole-heptazine with substituted phenols in organic solvents. In the present work, the electron and proton transfer dynamics driven by a femtosecond pump pulse and a time-delayed femtosecond push pulse has been studied with ab initio on-the-fly nonadiabatic trajectory calculations for the hydrogen-bonded heptazine-H2O complex. While the dynamics following the pump pulse is dominated by ultrafast radiationless energy relaxation to the long-lived lowest singlet excited state (S1) of the heptazine chromophore with only minor PCET reactivity, the re-excitation of the transient S1 population by the push pulse results in a much higher PCET reaction probability. These results illustrate that pump-push excitation has the potential to unravel the individual electron and proton transfer processes of PCET reactions on femtosecond time scales.</description>

      <title>Rapid, Broadband, Optical Spectroscopy of Cold Radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy of molecular radicals is an important tool in physical chemistry, and is a prerequisite for many experiments which use molecules for quantum science and precision measurement. However, even the simplest molecules have complex spectra which can be very time consuming to measure. Here we present an approach which offers the ability to measure the optical spectra of cryogenically-cooled molecular radicals with much greater efficiency. By combining a supercontinuum laser with a cryogenic buffer gas molecular source and a commercial optical spectrometer, we realize 15 nm of simultaneous bandwidth with 0.56 pm $(\approx 0.5$ GHz) resolution and high sensitivity. As a demonstration we measure and assign hundreds of lines and dozens of molecular constants from 15 bands in the $B^2\Sigma^+-X^2\Sigma^+$ system of CaF, including a low-abundance isotopologue, in a few hours. The setup is robust, simple, and should enable spectroscopy of molecular radicals with much higher throughput.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Expressions for Unitaries of Spin-Adapted Fermionic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the open challenges in quantum computing simulations of problems of chemical interest is the proper enforcement of spin symmetry. Efficient quantum circuits implementing unitaries generated by spin-adapted operators remain elusive, while na\"ive Trotterization schemes break spin symmetry. In this work, we analyze the mathematical structure of spin-adapted operators and derive closed-form expressions for unitaries generated by singlet spin-adapted generalized single and double excitations. These results represent significant progress toward the economical enforcement of spin symmetry in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Interface-Driven Spin-Orbit Coupling in Molecular Adsorbates on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) lifts molecular orbital degeneracy, enabling bi-level electronic platforms suitable for next-generation digital devices. However, common light-atom molecular feedstocks exhibit weak SOC due to the absence of heavy elements. To enhance SOC without synthesizing new materials, we leverage interfacial interactions between molecules and transition-element-based solid-state materials. This computational study investigates SOC splitting in metal-phthalocyanine adsorbed on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) using density functional theory (DFT). The enhanced SOC splitting is attributed to strong orbital hybridization at the molecule-substrate interface. Specifically, Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPC) on monolayer MoS2 achieves a notable SOC splitting of ~8 meV. Furthermore, when ZnPC forms self-assembled chains on MoS2, the splitting increases to ~20 meV, driven by the formation of hybrid bands modulated by molecular periodicity. These findings highlight the role of interfacial and intermolecular interactions in inducing and enhancing SOC in surface-adsorbed molecules, providing a new strategy for molecular spintronic materials without complex synthetic efforts.</description>

      <title>Neural network distillation of orbital dependent density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this paper, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta-generalized gradient approximation density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.</description>

      <title>Excited state assignment and state-resolved photoelectron circular dichroism in chalcogen-substituted fenchones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excited electronic states of fenchone, thiofenchone, and selenofenchone are characterized and assigned with different gas-phase spectroscopic methods and \textit{ab initio} quantum chemical calculations. With an increasing atomic number of the chalcogen, we observe increasing bathochromic (red) shifts, which vary in strength for Rydberg states, valence-excited states, and ionization energies. The spectroscopic insight is used to state-resolve the contributions in multi-photon photoelectron circular dichroism with femtosecond laser pulses. This is shown to be a sensitive observable of molecular chirality in all studied chalcogenofenchones. Our work contributes new spectroscopic information, particularly on thiofenchone and selenofenchone. It may open a perspective for future coherent control experiments exploiting resonances in the visible and or near-ultraviolet spectral regions.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>

      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics Yields Anharmonic Rabi Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) approach to the quantum Rabi model, involving a classical optical field coupled self-consistently to a quantum two-level system. Under the rotating wave approximation, we analytically show this approach to yield persistent yet anharmonic Rabi oscillations, governed by an undamped and unforced Duffing equation. We consider the single-quantum limit, where we find such anharmonic Rabi oscillations to closely follow full-quantum results once zero-point energy is approximately enforced when initializing the optical field coordinate. Our findings provide guidance in the application of MQC dynamics to classes of problems involving small quantum numbers and far away from decoherence.</description>

      <title>Colossal Dielectric Response and Electric Polarization in Lithium Nitrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium nitrate LiNO$_3$ is identified to possess a dielectric constant $\epsilon$' larger than 6x10$^6$ at 1 kHz in powder samples above the critical temperature $T$$_W$ = 306 K. For single crystalline samples, $\epsilon$' can be sustained to remain above 10$^5$ and the dissipation factor below 10 in the temperature region of 280-340 K after a simple 'activation' process. Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are amongst one of the highest in all known materials. We propose a model suggesting the mechanism underlying the colossal magnitudes of $\epsilon$' and $P$ to stem from a gearing-ungearing process of the planar NO$_3$$^-$ at the macroscopic level. Our results potentially push the boundaries of ceramic capacitors.</description>

      <title>Electrons as intermediate charge carriers in ion transport through nanoscale channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.</description>
