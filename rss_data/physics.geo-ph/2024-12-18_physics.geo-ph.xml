      <title>Training a Distributed Acoustic Sensing Traffic Monitoring Network With Video Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) has emerged as a promising tool for real-time traffic monitoring in densely populated areas. In this paper, we present a novel concept that integrates DAS data with co-located visual information. We use YOLO-derived vehicle location and classification from camera inputs as labeled data to train a detection and classification neural network utilizing DAS data only. Our model achieves a performance exceeding 94% for detection and classification, and about 1.2% false alarm rate. We illustrate the model's application in monitoring traffic over a week, yielding statistical insights that could benefit future smart city developments. Our approach highlights the potential of combining fiber-optic sensors with visual information, focusing on practicality and scalability, protecting privacy, and minimizing infrastructure costs. To encourage future research, we share our dataset.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic tidal dissipation in misaligned planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tides are the main driving force behind the long-term evolution of planetary systems. The associated energy dissipation and momentum exchanges are commonly described by Love numbers, which relate the exciting potential to the tidally perturbed potential. These transfer functions are generally assumed to depend solely on tidal frequency and body rheology, following the isotropic assumption, which presumes invariance of properties by rotation about the centre of mass. We examine the limitations of the isotropic assumption for fluid bodies, where Coriolis acceleration breaks spherical symmetry, resulting in rotational scattering and complex tidal responses. Using angular momentum theory, we derive a new formalism to calculate the tidal rates of energy and momentum transfers in non-isotropic cases. We apply this formalism to the Earth-Moon system to assess the effects of anisotropy in planet-satellite systems with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta. Our findings indicate that the isotropic assumption can introduce significant errors in planetary evolution models, particularly in the dynamical tide regime. These errors stem from forced wave resonances, with inaccuracies in energy dissipation scaling in proportion to resonance amplification factors.</description>

      <title>An instrument to link global positioning to the Universe -- Observing GNSS satellites with the Australian VLBI array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new instrument enabling a novel combination of Earth measuring techniques: direct observations with the radio astronomical instruments to satellites of the global navigation satellite systems. Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>

      <title>Sedimentary rocks from Mediterranean drought in the Messinian age as a probe of the past cosmic ray flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of natural minerals as detectors to study the past flux of cosmic rays. This novel application of the \textit{paleo-detector} technique requires a specific approach as it needs samples that have been exposed to secondary cosmic rays for a well defined period of time. We suggest here the use of the evaporites formed during the desiccation of the Mediterranean sea ${\sim}6$ Myr ago. These minerals have been created and exposed to the air or under a shallow water basin for ${\sim}500$ kyr before being quickly submerged again by a km-scale overburden of water. We show that, by looking at the damages left in the minerals by muons in cosmic ray showers, we could detect differences in the primary cosmic ray flux during that period, as the ones expected from nearby supernova explosions, below the percent-level. We show also that little to no background from radioactive contamination and other astroparticles is expected for this kind of analysis.</description>
