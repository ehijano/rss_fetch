      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>2.34 kV \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Vertical Trench RESURF Schottky Barrier Diode with sub-micron fin width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a kilovolt-class \b{eta}-Ga2O3 vertical trench Schottky barrier diode with a field plate incorporating narrow fin width (Wfin) structures of sub-micron dimensions. We used a nanolaminate dielectric comprising a stack of multiple thin TiO2 and Al2O3 layers as RESURF dielectric and for field plate edge termination. Both Wfin of 200 nm and 500 nm demonstrate excellent on-state performance with specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) of 9.8-12 mohmcm2, and 10^10 rectification ratio. A self-aligned photoresist planarization and etch-back process was employed to expose the top of the fins for Schottky contact formation, eliminating critical lithographic alignment challenges in sub-micron scale processing. We achieved a breakdown of 2.34 kV with very low leakage currents before catastrophic breakdown. The measured breakdown voltage is limited by dielectric breakdown at the trench bottom corner as verified by metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) test structure. TCAD simulation shows a reduced electric field at the surface of the metal-semiconductor junction due to the RESURF effect, resulting in very low reverse leakage before breakdown. The parallel plane electric field in the \b{eta} -Ga2O3 is extracted to be 3.8 MV/cm from TCAD simulations using accurately extracted drift layer doping profile from high voltage CV measurements. A power figure of merit of 0.867 GW/cm2(0.56 GW/cm2 with current spreading) was calculated. Enhanced RESURF by integration of high-k dielectrics with self-aligned photoresist planarization, offers a promising pathway towards high figure of merit, low leakage high-performance vertical devices.</description>

      <title>Understanding the oxidation of pure Tungsten in air and its impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxidation of pure W and the sublimation of W oxide have been investigated to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant. Pure W has been oxidised at temperatures between 400 and 1050C and for durations ranging between 1 and 70 h. The formation of voids and cracks has been observed at temperatures above 600C, leading to the formation of dust or oxide spalling, which could be problematic in maintenance and waste-handling scenarios of a fusion power plant. Preferential oxidation taking place at the edge of the specimen was characterised, and its impact is discussed in relation to component design. Characterisation using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: the inner layer is 30-50 nm thick WO2 oxide, the middle layer is a 10-20 um of WO_2.72 and the outer layer is formed of WO2.9/WO3 phases - whose thickness varies according to the total thickness of the oxide scale. The observed microstructure is discussed in relation to the parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its potential impact on tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tunable Transmissive Metagratings Using Single Layer Cylindrical Plasma Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel single-layer reconfigurable transmissive metagrating based on plasma discharges. Each unit-cell consists of two side-by-side core-shell cylinders, with a tunable plasma core and a high-index dielectric shell. The structure is modeled using a free-electron plasma permittivity with adjustable plasma frequency. Analytical and numerical results show that the main transmission lobe can be switched between -41{\deg}, 0{\deg} and 41{\deg} by tuning the plasma frequencies. Transmission efficiency remains above 80% at broadside and 90% in the steered direction. This tunability enables effective directional control with low reflection and high overall power efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Ultra-Long Continuous Wafer-Scale Periodic Poling in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) crystals are the fundamental building block for highly-efficient quantum light sources and frequency converters. The efficiency of these devices is strongly dependent on the interaction length between the light and the nonlinear material, scaling quadratically with this parameter. Nevertheless, the fabrication of long, continuously poled areas in TFLN remains challenging, the length of continuously poled areas rarely exceeds 10 mm. In this work, we demonstrate a significant progress in this field achieving the periodic poling of continuous poled areas of 70 mm length with a 3 microns poling period and a close to 50 % duty cycle. We compare two poling electrode design approaches to fabricate long, continuous poled areas. The first approach involves the poling of a single, continuous 70 mm long electrode. The second utilize a segmented approach including the poling of more than 20 individual sections forming together a 70 mm long poling area with no stitching errors. While the continuous electrode allows for faster fabrication, the segmented approach allows to individually optimize the poling resulting in less duty cycle variation. A detailed analysis of the periodic poling results reveals that the results of both are consistent with previously reported poling outcomes for shorter devices. Thus, we demonstrate wafer-scale periodic poling exceeding chiplet-size without any loss in the periodic poling quality. Our work presents a key step towards highly-efficient, narrowbandwidth and low-pump power nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>Polymer-based probabilistic bits for thermodynamic computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) are stochastic hardware elements whose output probability can be tuned by an input bias, offering a route to energy-efficient architectures that exploit, rather than suppress, fluctuations. Here we report p-bit generation in an organic memristive device, establishing polymers as the first class of soft-matter systems to realize probabilistic hardware. The active element is a dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DTP)-backbone polymer with pendant triphenylamine (TPA) groups, whose stochastic resistance fluctuations are converted into binary outputs by a simple voltage-divider/comparator circuit. The resulting probability distributions follow logistic transfer functions, characteristic of stochastic binary neurons. Separately, ensembles of pulsed IV measurements were analyzed to construct binned current distributions, from which the discrete Shannon entropy was calculated. Peaks in this entropy coincide with bias conditions that maximize variability in the memristor voltage drop, directly linking device-level stochasticity to intrinsic material properties. Dielectric analysis shows that pendant TPA units provide dynamically active relaxation modes, while energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that the frontier orbitals of DTP, TPA and ITO align within the transport gap to produce a bifurcated percolation network. The correspondence between microscopic relaxation dynamics, electronic energetics and macroscopic probabilistic response highlights how organic semiconductors can serve as chemically tunable entropy sources, opening a polymer-based pathway toward thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new and comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs). HBARs demonstrate several very sharp resonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency range. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses significant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models the unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate (a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and critically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which imparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use of fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and sets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical device, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband datasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously fitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1 GHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling coefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by leveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be easily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes, multiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting measured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various perturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be useful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and sensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Emulating microbial run-and-tumble and tactic motion by stochastically reorienting synthetic active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replicating efficient and adaptable microbial navigation strategies, such as run and tumble (RnT) and tactic motions to synthetic active agents has been an enduring quest. To this end, we introduce a stochastic orientational reset (SOR) protocol, in which the propulsion direction of an active Brownian particle (ABP) is reassigned to a random orientation within a defined reset-cone. When the reset-cone is aligned with the instantaneous propulsion direction, ABPs reproduce the RnT dynamics of E. coli; when set along an attractant gradient, they exhibit taxis - with extensive adaptability in persistence through the angular width of the reset-cone and reset rate. We establish the robustness of this protocol across a broad range of swimming speeds using experiments, simulations, and analytical theory.</description>

      <title>Characterization and virtualization of a medical ultrasound transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of data-driven ultrasound imaging technologies, realistic simulation of ultrasound fields and radio-frequency data is becoming increasingly important. Accurate transducer characterization is crucial for realistic simulations. In this work, we present a streamlined ultrasound characterization pipeline that creates a virtual transducer model from acoustic holography measurements of the ultrasound field. The pipeline enables the extraction of the transmit impulse response, the receive impulse response, the size of the transducer aperture, and the focal distance of the lens. The method relies on acoustic field projections using either the angular spectrum method or Rayleigh integrals. Additionally, we present a method to compensate for misalignment in the measurement setup, based on the angular spectrum of the holographic measurement. We demonstrate the application of the characterization pipeline to a P4-1 phased array transducer. The resulting virtual transducer model can be imported into the PROTEUS simulation software for the generation of physically realistic ultrasound fields and ultrasound radio-frequency data with arbitrary transmit settings. The characterization pipeline has been released as an open-source toolkit to enable the ultrasound community to perform transducer characterization with increased accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic In-Memory Computing with Phase-Change Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) is an emerging non-von Neumann paradigm that leverages the intrinsic physics of memory devices to perform computations directly within the memory array. Among the various candidates, phase-change memory (PCM) has emerged as a leading non-volatile technology, showing significant promise for IMC, particularly in deep learning acceleration. PCM-based IMC is also poised to play a pivotal role in cryogenic applications, including quantum computing and deep space electronics. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of PCM devices across temperatures down to 5 K, covering the range most relevant to these domains. We systematically investigate key physical mechanisms such as phase transitions and threshold switching that govern device programming at low temperatures. In addition, we study attributes including electrical transport, structural relaxation, and read noise, which critically affect readout behavior and, in turn, the precision achievable in computational tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a general design method for finding the passive, reciprocal surface impedance tensor required to enact any wave transformation. We do this through characterising the surface in terms of a tensorial surface impedance, showing that a large family of impedance distributions can be found that perform an identical wave transformation. Even when the conditions of reciprocity and passivity are imposed, there still remain many solutions to the design problem.} We exploit this as a design method for metasurfaces, giving two examples where the metasurface rotates the input polarization and reshapes the output field, showing we can parameterize the set of equivalent reciprocal metasurfaces in terms of a single complex parameter. \hl{In addition, through allowing dissipation and gain within the response, the surface can have many different functionalities in the orthogonal polarization, opening up a new route for the design of multiplexed metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Diameter dependence of light absorption in GaAs nanowires evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires are attractive for photovoltaic applications because light absorption can be enhanced compared to planar layers due to the more complex coupling of light with wavelength-scale matter. However, experimentally it is very challenging to investigate light absorption in single nanowires. Here, we employ photoluminescence spectroscopy as a new method to investigate how the diameter of highly phase-pure GaAs nanowires affects light absorption. The underlying concept is that the absorption of the exciting laser light influences the photogenerated carrier density and in turn spectral features. In particular, we exploit that both the saturation of a specific defect line and the transition from excitonic to electron-hole-plasma recombination occur at well-defined carrier densities. We find that absorption is maximized for a diameter of about 80\,nm. Our approach may be transferred to other material systems and thus enables systematic experimental studies of absorption enhancement in single nanowires.</description>

      <title>Terahretz Channel Modeling in ULEO Satellite-to-Ground Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential growth in satellite data traffic demands communication systems exceeding current microwave capacity limitations, while the terahertz (THz) frequency band (0.1-10 THz) offers unprecedented bandwidth potential with superior weather resilience compared to optical systems, particularly when combined with ultra-low Earth orbit (ULEO) satellite deployments below 300 km altitude. This article presents comprehensive channel modeling and performance evaluation for ULEO-THz satellite-to-ground communications, analyzing three distinct transmission architectures (direct satellite-to-ground, satellite-relay-ground forwarding, and satellite-to-high altitude base station with fiber backhaul) through altitude-resolved atmospheric propagation models validated using year-long meteorological data from four high-altitude stations in Tibet and Qinghai, China. The analysis incorporates frequency-dependent atmospheric absorption using ITU-R standards, free-space path loss with curved atmospheric modeling, and regional atmospheric variations to derive total channel path loss, available bandwidth capacity, and bit error rate (BER) performance under both AWGN and Weibull fading conditions across multiple THz frequencies. Results demonstrate that direct satellite-to-ground transmission at lower THz frequencies achieves optimal practical performance with maximum available bandwidth under QPSK modulation, while satellite-relay-ground forwarding suffers prohibitive cumulative losses from multiple hops, and satellite-to-high altitude base station configurations, despite favorable atmospheric channel characteristics, become impractical due to substantial electro-optical conversion penalties and fiber transmission losses in long-haul applications.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the convergence properties of a collection of iterative electron ptychography methods, under low electron doses ($&lt;$ 10$^3$ $e^-/A^2$) and gives particular attention to the impact of the user-defined update strengths. We demonstrate that carefully chosen values for this parameter, ideally smaller than those conventionally met in the literature, are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice achievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are relatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we demonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error increases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the algorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography, especially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective convergence and correctness of the result.</description>
