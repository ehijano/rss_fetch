      <title>Geometry-based Multi-beam Survey Line Layout Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-beam measurement system plays a crucial role in ocean mapping and underwater terrain detection. By simultaneously transmitting multiple beams, the system can accurately receive sound waves reflected from the seabed, providing more precise and comprehensive water depth information while effectively revealing the complexity and characteristics of underwater terrain. Building upon the background and application provided by Question B of the 2023 National Mathematical Contest in Modeling for College Students, this paper investigates the relationship between ocean floor width measurement and factors such as beam position, angle, and slope. Utilizing geometric relations, trigonometric similarity, and sine theorem, a mathematical model is established to determine adjacent strip coverage width and overlap ratio. Furthermore, an optimal strategy is determined using a greedy algorithm, while binary search backtracking is employed to derive the interval of the next adjacent survey line with the required overlap ratio in order to obtain an optimal terrain detection strategy.</description>

      <title>Error estimates of physics-informed neural networks for approximating Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent successful application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve Boltzmann-type equations [S. Jin, Z. Ma, and K. Wu, J. Sci. Comput., 94 (2023), pp. 57], we provide a rigorous error analysis for PINNs in approximating the solution of the Boltzmann equation near a global Maxwellian. The challenge arises from the nonlocal quadratic interaction term defined in the unbounded domain of velocity space. Analyzing this term on an unbounded domain requires the inclusion of a truncation function, which demands delicate analysis techniques. As a generalization of this analysis, we also provide proof of the asymptotic preserving property when using micro-macro decomposition-based neural networks.</description>

      <title>A fitted space-time finite element method for an advection-diffusion problem with moving interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fitted space-time finite element method for solving a parabolic advection-diffusion problem with a nonstationary interface. The jumping diffusion coefficient gives rise to the discontinuity of the spatial gradient of solution across the interface. We use the Banach-Necas-Babuska theorem to show the well-posedness of the continuous variational problem. A fully discrete finite-element based scheme is analyzed using the Galerkin method and unstructured fitted meshes. An optimal error estimate is established in a discrete energy norm under appropriate globally low but locally high regularity conditions. Some numerical results corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>MgFNO: Multi-grid Architecture Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In science and engineering, there is often a need to repeatedly solve large-scale and high-resolution partial differential equations (PDEs). Neural operators are a new type of models that can map between function spaces, allowing trained models to emulate the solution operators of PDEs. This paper introduces a novel Fourier neural operator with a multigrid architecture (MgFNO). The MgFNO combines the frequency principle of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the multigrid idea for solving linear systems. To speed up the training process of the FNO, a three-layer V-cycle multigrid architecture is used. This architecture involves training the model multiple times on a coarse grid and then transferring it to a fine grid to accelerate the training of the model. The DNN-based solver learns the solution from low to high frequency, while the multigrid method acquires the solution from high to low frequency. Note that the FNO is a resolution-invariant solution operator, therefore the corresponding calculations are greatly simplified. Finally, experiments are conducted on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The results demonstrate that the proposed MgFNO outperforms the traditional Fourier neural operator.</description>

      <title>Extending DD-$\alpha$AMG on heterogeneous machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multigrid solvers are the standard in modern scientific computing simulations. Domain Decomposition Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid, also known as the DD-$\alpha$AMG solver, is a successful realization of an algebraic multigrid solver for lattice quantum chromodynamics. Its CPU implementation has made it possible to construct, for some particular discretizations, simulations otherwise computationally unfeasible, and furthermore it has motivated the development and improvement of other algebraic multigrid solvers in the area. From an existing version of DD-$\alpha$AMG already partially ported via CUDA to run some finest-level operations of the multigrid solver on Nvidia GPUs, we translate the CUDA code here by using HIP to run on the ORISE supercomputer. We moreover extend the smoothers available in DD-$\alpha$AMG, paying particular attention to Richardson smoothing, which in our numerical experiments has led to a multigrid solver faster than smoothing with GCR and only 10% slower compared to SAP smoothing. Then we port the odd-even-preconditioned versions of GMRES and Richardson via CUDA. Finally, we extend some computationally intensive coarse-grid operations via advanced vectorization.</description>

      <title>Propagation and non-reciprocity in time-modulated diffusion through the lens of high-order homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The homogenization procedure developed here is conducted on a laminate with periodic space-time modulation on the fine scale: at leading order, this modulation creates convection in the low-wavelength regime if both parameters are modulated. However, if only one parameter is modulated, which is more realistic, this convective term disappears and one recovers a standard diffusion equation with effective homogeneous parameters; this does not describe the non-reciprocity and the propagation of the field observed from exact dispersion diagrams. This inconsistency is corrected here by considering second-order homogenization which results in a non-reciprocal propagation term that is proved to be non-zero for any laminate and verified via numerical simulation. The same methodology is also applied to the case when the density is modulated in the heat equation, leading therefore to a corrective advective term which cancels out non-reciprocity at the leading order but not at the second order.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Approximation by the Peano-Baker Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a new method for numerically approximating sensitivities in parameter-dependent ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our approach, intended for situations where the standard forward and adjoint sensitivity analyses become too computationally costly for practical purposes, is based on the Peano-Baker series from control theory. Using this series, we construct a representation of the sensitivity matrix $\mathbf{S}$ and, from this representation, a numerical method for approximating $\mathbf{S}$. We prove that, under standard regularity assumptions, the error of our method scales as $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2_{\text{max}})$, where $\Delta t_{\text{max}}$ is the largest time step used when numerically solving the ODE. We illustrate the performance of the method in several numerical experiments, taken from both the systems biology setting and more classical dynamical systems. The experiments show the sought-after improvement in running time of our method compared to the forward sensitivity approach. In experiments involving a random linear system, the forward approach requires roughly $\sqrt{n}$ longer computational time, where $n$ is the dimension of the parameter space, than our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust, randomized preconditioning for kernel ridge regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates two randomized preconditioning techniques for solving kernel ridge regression (KRR) problems with a medium to large number of data points ($10^4 \leq N \leq 10^7$), and it introduces two new methods with state-of-the-art performance. The first method, RPCholesky preconditioning, accurately solves the full-data KRR problem in $O(N^2)$ arithmetic operations, assuming sufficiently rapid polynomial decay of the kernel matrix eigenvalues. The second method, KRILL preconditioning, offers an accurate solution to a restricted version of the KRR problem involving $k \ll N$ selected data centers at a cost of $O((N + k^2) k \log k)$ operations. The proposed methods solve a broad range of KRR problems, making them ideal for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, N\'ed\'elec elements on locally refined meshes with hanging nodes are considered. A crucial aspect is the orientation of the hanging edges and faces. For non-orientable meshes, no solution or implementation has been available to date. The problem statement and corresponding algorithms are described in great detail. As a model problem, the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations are adopted because N\'ed\'elec elements constitute their natural discretization. The algorithms and implementation are demonstrated through two numerical examples on different uniformly and adaptively refined meshes. The implementation is performed within the finite element library deal.II.</description>

      <title>A Divergence-Free and $H(div)$-Conforming Embedded-Hybridized DG Method for the Incompressible Resistive MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a divergence-free and $H(div)$-conforming hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method and a computationally efficient variant called embedded-HDG (E-HDG) for solving stationary incompressible viso-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The proposed E-HDG approach uses continuous facet unknowns for the vector-valued solutions (velocity and magnetic fields) while it uses discontinuous facet unknowns for the scalar variable (pressure and magnetic pressure). This choice of function spaces makes E-HDG computationally far more advantageous, due to the much smaller number of degrees of freedom, compared to the HDG counterpart. The benefit is even more significant for three-dimensional/high-order/fine mesh scenarios. On simplicial meshes, the proposed methods with a specific choice of approximation spaces are well-posed for linear(ized) MHD equations. For nonlinear MHD problems, we present a simple approach exploiting the proposed linear discretizations by using a Picard iteration. The beauty of this approach is that the divergence-free and $H(div)$-conforming properties of the velocity and magnetic fields are automatically carried over for nonlinear MHD equations. We study the accuracy and convergence of our E-HDG method for both linear and nonlinear MHD cases through various numerical experiments, including two- and three-dimensional problems with smooth and singular solutions. The numerical examples show that the proposed methods are pressure robust, and the divergence of the resulting velocity and magnetic fields is machine zero for both smooth and singular problems.</description>

Abstract: The paper considers the convergence of the complex block Jacobi diagonalization methods under the large set of the generalized serial pivot strategies. The global convergence of the block methods for Hermitian, normal and $J$-Hermitian matrices is proven. In order to obtain the convergence results for the block methods that solve other eigenvalue problems, such as the generalized eigenvalue problem, we consider the convergence of a general block iterative process which uses the complex block Jacobi annihilators and operators.</description>

      <title>New limiter regions for multidimensional flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate transport algorithms are crucial for computational fluid dynamics and more accurate and efficient schemes are always in development. One dimensional limiting is commonly employed to suppress nonphysical oscillations. However, the application of such limiters can reduce accuracy. It is important to identify the weakest set of sufficient conditions required on the limiter as to allow the development of successful numerical algorithms.
  The main goal of this paper is to identify new less restrictive sufficient conditions for flux form in-compressible advection to remain monotonic. We identify additional necessary conditions for incompressible flux form advection to be monotonic, demonstrating that the Spekreijse limiter region is not sufficient for incompressible flux form advection to remain monotonic. Then a convex combination argument is used to derive new sufficient conditions that are less restrictive than the Sweby region for a discrete maximum principle. This allows the introduction of two new more general limiter regions suitable for flux form incompressible advection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though ubiquitous as first-principles models for conservative phenomena, Hamiltonian systems present numerous challenges for model reduction even in relatively simple, linear cases. Here, we present a method for the projection-based model reduction of canonical Hamiltonian systems that is variationally consistent for any choice of linear reduced basis: Hamiltonian models project to Hamiltonian models. Applicable in both intrusive and nonintrusive settings, the proposed method is energy-conserving and symplectic, with error provably decomposable into a data projection term and a term measuring deviation from canonical form. Examples from linear elasticity with realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the advantages of a variationally consistent approach, highlighting the steady convergence exhibited by consistent models where previous methods reliant on inconsistent techniques or specially designed bases exhibit unacceptably large errors.</description>

      <title>A Finite Element Method by Patch Reconstruction for the Quad-Curl Problem Using Mixed Formulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a high order reconstructed discontinuous approximation (RDA) method for solving a mixed formulation of the quad-curl problem in two and three dimensions. This mixed formulation is established by adding an auxiliary variable to control the divergence of the field. The approximation space for the original variables is constructed by patch reconstruction with exactly one degree of freedom per element in each dimension and the auxiliary variable is approximated by the piecewise constant space. We prove the optimal convergence rate under the energy norm and also suboptimal $L^2$ convergence using a duality approach. Numerical results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04396v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on developing classical surrogates for parametrized quantum circuits using interpolation via (trigonometric) polynomials. We develop two algorithms for the construction of such surrogates and prove performance guarantees. The constructions are based on circuit evaluations which are blackbox in the sense that no structural specifics of the circuits are exploited. While acknowledging the limitations of the blackbox approach compared to whitebox evaluations, which exploit specific circuit properties, we demonstrate scenarios in which the blackbox approach might prove beneficial. Sample applications include but are not restricted to the approximation of VQEs and the alleviaton of the barren plateau problem.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of the stochastic heat equation with a distributional reaction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of the stochastic heat equation with a distributional reaction term. Under a condition on the Besov regularity of the reaction term, it was proven recently that a strong solution exists and is unique in the pathwise sense, in a class of H\"older continuous processes. For a suitable choice of sequence $(b^k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ approximating $b$, we prove that the error between the solution $u$ of the SPDE with reaction term $b$ and its tamed Euler finite-difference scheme with mollified drift $b^k$, converges to $0$ in $L^m(\Omega)$ with a rate that depends on the Besov regularity of $b$. In particular, one can consider two interesting cases: first, even when $b$ is only a (finite) measure, a rate of convergence is obtained. On the other hand, when $b$ is a bounded measurable function, the (almost) optimal rate of convergence $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)$-in space and $(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon)$-in time is achieved. Stochastic sewing techniques are used in the proofs, in particular to deduce new regularising properties of the discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>
