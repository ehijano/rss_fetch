      <title>HELIOS -- Hybrid Evaluation of Lifecycle and Impact of Outstanding Science v-2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a substantial enhancement of the HELIOS (Hybrid Evaluation of Lifecycle and Impact of Outstanding Science) model, transforming it from a static assessment tool into a dynamic and predictive framework for technological maturity. It addresses the limitations of the original model, which relied on linear normalization and fixed weights. Key modifications include the adoption of non-linear normalization functions (sigmoids), the integration of S-curve growth models for forecasting key indicators (Investment, Publications, Patents, Adoption, Regulation), the implementation of dynamic weighting schemes based on lifecycle phases, the application of non-linear aggregation functions to capture synergies and redundancies, and the incorporation of uncertainty quantification techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations. These advanced mathematical formulations enable HELIOS to provide probabilistic forecasts, identify critical inflection points, and offer a more nuanced understanding of a technology's trajectory. This makes it an invaluable tool for strategic planning, R&amp;D investment evaluation, and policy-making in the domain of emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation among migrating resource-oriented agents under environmental variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental to human societies. While several basic theoretical mechanisms underlying its evolution have been established, research addressing more realistic settings remains underdeveloped. Drawing on the hypothesis that intensified environmental fluctuations drove early behavioral evolution in humans during the Middle Stone Age in Africa, we examine the effects of environmental variability and human mobility on the evolution of cooperation. In our model, the variability is represented by randomly moving resource-rich spots across a two-dimensional space, and the mobility is represented by resource-seeking migration of agents. These agents interact cooperatively or competitively for resources while adopting behavioral strategies from more successful neighbors. Through extensive simulations of this model, we reveal three key findings: (i) with sufficient agent mobility, even modest environmental variability promotes cooperation, but further variability does not enhance cooperation; (ii) with any level of environmental variability, agent mobility promotes cooperation; and (iii) these effects occur because the joint effect of environmental variability and agent mobility disrupts defector groups in resource-rich areas, forming cooperator groups on those sites. Although previous studies examine environmental variability and mobility separately, to our knowledge this is the first study to analyze their joint effects on the evolution of cooperation. These findings suggest that environmental variability can promote cooperative group formation without enhanced cognitive abilities, providing new insights into the evolution of human cooperation and, by extension, sociality.</description>

      <title>Traffic State Estimation in Congestion to Extend Applicability of DFOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a traffic state estimation (TSE) method in congestion for distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). DFOS detects vehicle driving vibrations along the optical fiber and obtains their trajectories in the spatiotemporal plane. From these trajectories, DFOS provides mean velocities for real-time spatially continuous traffic monitoring without dead zones. However, when vehicle vibration intensities are insufficiently low due to slow speed, trajectories cannot be obtained, leading to missing values in mean velocity data. It restricts DFOS applicability in severe congestion. Therefore, this paper proposes a missing value imputation method based on data assimilation. Our proposed method is validated on two expressways in Japan with the reference data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the imputed mean velocities to the reference increases only by 1.5 km/h as compared with the MAE of non-missing values. This study enhances the wide-range applicability of DFOS in practical cases.</description>

      <title>PDE-constrained optimal control of a leader-follower opinion formation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the PDE-constrained optimal control of a leader-follower kinetic opinion formation model, with a Fokker-Planck-type system of partial differential equations as a state constraint. We derive the Boltzmann-type and Fokker-Planck-type systems of equations associated with the controlled leader-follower opinion formation model. In a function space setting we derive first-order optimality conditions associated with the PDE-constrained optimal control problem, yielding an optimality system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. We employ a gradient-type sweeping algorithm to numerically attack the optimality system obtained from the first-order optimality conditions. We present the results from a finite elements based simulation for different types of interactions and cost functionals.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties within Weather Regime definitions for the Euro-Atlantic sector in ERA5 and CMIP6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain Weather Regimes (WR) are associated with a higher risk of energy shortages, i.e. Blocking regimes for European winters. However, there are many uncertainties tied to the implementation of WRs and associated risks in the energy sector. Especially the impact of climate change is unknown.
  We investigate these uncertainties by looking at three methodologically diverse Euro-Atlantic WR definitions. We carry out a thorough validation of these methods and analyse their methodological and spatio-temporal sensitivity using ERA5 data. Furthermore, we look into the suitability of CMIP6 models for WR based impact assessments.
  Our sensitivity assessment showed that the persistence and occurrence of regimes are sensitive to small changes in the methodology. We show that the training period used has a very significant impact on the persistence and occurrence of the regimes found. For both WR4 and WR7, this results in instability of the regime patterns.
  All CMIP6 models investigated show instability of the regimes. Meaning that the normalised distance between the CMIP6 model regimes and our baseline regimes exceeds 0.4 or are visually extremely dissimilar. Only the WR4 regimes clustered on historical CMIP6 model data consistently have a normalised distance to our baseline regimes smaller than 0.4 and are visually identifiable. The WR6 definition exceeds the normalised distance threshold for all investigated CMIP6 experiments. Though all CMIP6 model experiments clustered with the WR7 definition have a normalised distance to the baseline regimes below 0.4, visual inspection of the regimes indicates instability.
  Great caution should be taken when applying WR's in impact models for the energy sector, due to this large instability and uncertainties associated with WR definitions.</description>

      <title>Operational Validation of Large-Language-Model Agent Social Simulation: Evidence from Voat v/technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative social simulations that can capture culturally informed, norm-guided interaction on online social platforms. We build a technology community simulation modeled on Voat, a Reddit-like alt-right news aggregator and discussion platform active from 2014 to 2020. Using the YSocial framework, we seed the simulation with a fixed catalog of technology links sampled from Voat's shared URLs (covering 30+ domains) and calibrate parameters to Voat's v/technology using samples from the MADOC dataset. Agents use a base, uncensored model (Dolphin 3.0, based on Llama 3.1 8B) and concise personas (demographics, political leaning, interests, education, toxicity propensity) to generate posts, replies, and reactions under platform rules for link and text submissions, threaded replies and daily activity cycles. We run a 30-day simulation and evaluate operational validity by comparing distributions and structures with matched Voat data: activity patterns, interaction networks, toxicity, and topic coverage. Results indicate familiar online regularities: similar activity rhythms, heavy-tailed participation, sparse low-clustering interaction networks, core-periphery structure, topical alignment with Voat, and elevated toxicity. Limitations of the current study include the stateless agent design and evaluation based on a single 30-day run, which constrains external validity and variance estimates. The simulation generates realistic discussions, often featuring toxic language, primarily centered on technology topics such as Big Tech and AI. This approach offers a valuable method for examining toxicity dynamics and testing moderation strategies within a controlled environment.</description>

      <title>The Spontaneous Cascading Mechanism Behind Critical Phenomena in Self-Coupled Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic physics of lasers is characterized by a second-order continuous phase transition at the critical lasing threshold. Nevertheless, laser bistability with abrupt transitions has been reported in some laser systems, but its underlying mechanism has never been explored. Here we study experimentally and theoretically a novel nonlinearly self-coupled laser system. We show both experimentally and theoretically that this system experiences spontaneous cascading that yields an abrupt mixed-order transition. At the critical point, a long-lived cascading plateau is observed, characterized by a critical branching factor equal to one. When deviating from criticality, the branching factor departs monotonically from one. The critical scaling close to and at the critical point resembles similar phenomena observed recently in other interdependent systems, suggesting a common universal cascading origin for abrupt transitions. Our results shed light on the cascading mechanism of abrupt transitions in laser systems, which can be utilized for future research and applications.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted polarisation and information reliability in climate change discussions on social media platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms like YouTube and Twitter play a key role in disseminating both reliable and unreliable information about climate change. This study analyses the topology of interactions in Twitter and their relation to cross-platform sharing, content discussions and emotional responses. We examined climate change discussions across four topics: the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate refugees, and Do\~nana Natural Park. While retweets reinforce in-group cohesion in the form of echo chambers, inter-group exposure is significant through mentions, suggesting that exposure to opposing views intensifies polarisation, rather than mitigates it. Ideological divides feature content differences accompanied by steeper negative sentiments, especially from right-leaning communities prone to share low-reliability information. We identified a topological alignment between platforms, indicating that ideological communities span multiple sites. Our findings show that climate change polarisation is multifaceted, involving ideological divides, structural isolation, and emotional engagement. These results suggest that effective climate policy discussions must address the emotional and identity-driven nature of public discourse and seek strategies to bridge ideological divides.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Multidimensional Opinions with Topic-Weighted Discordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People's opinions on a wide range of topics often evolve over time through their interactions with others. Models of opinion dynamics primarily focus on one-dimensional opinions, which represent opinions on one topic. However, opinions on various topics are rarely isolated; instead, they can be interdependent and correlated. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, agents are receptive to each other only if their opinions are sufficiently similar. We extend classical agent-based BCMs -- namely, the Hegselmann--Krause BCM, which has synchronous interactions, and the Deffuant--Weisbuch BCM, which has asynchronous interactions -- to a multidimensional setting, in which the opinions are multidimensional vectors representing opinions of different topics and opinions on different topics are interdependent. To measure opinion differences between agents, we introduce topic-weighted discordance functions that account for opinion differences in all topics. We define regions of receptiveness for our models, and we use them to characterize the steady-state opinion clusters and provide an analytical approach to compute these regions. In addition, we numerically simulate our models on various networks with initial opinions drawn from a variety of distributions. When initial opinions are correlated across different topics, our topic-weighted BCMs yield significantly different results in both transient and steady states compared to baseline models, where the dynamics of each opinion topic are independent.</description>
