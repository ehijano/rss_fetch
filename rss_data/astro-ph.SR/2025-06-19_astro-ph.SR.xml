      <title>Astronomical Cardiology: A Search For Heartbeat Stars Using $\textit{Gaia}$ and $\textit{TESS}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heartbeat stars are a subclass of binary stars with short periods, high eccentricities, and phase-folded light curves that resemble an electrocardiogram. We start from the $\textit{Gaia}$ catalogs of spectroscopic binaries and use $\textit{TESS}$ photometry to identify 112 new heartbeat star systems. We fit their phase-folded light curves with an analytic model to measure their orbital periods, eccentricities, inclinations, and arguments of periastron. We then compare these orbital parameters to the $\textit{Gaia}$ spectroscopic orbital solution. Our periods and eccentricities are consistent with the $\textit{Gaia}$ solutions for 85$\%$ of the single-line spectroscopic binaries but only 20$\%$ of the double-line spectroscopic binaries. For the two double-line spectroscopic binary heartbeat stars with consistent orbits, we combine the $\textit{TESS}$ phase-folded light curve and the $\textit{Gaia}$ velocity semi-amplitudes to measure the stellar masses and radii with $\texttt{PHOEBE}$. In a statistical analysis of the HB population, we find that non-giant heartbeat stars have evolved off the main sequence and that their fractional abundance rises rapidly with effective temperature.</description>

      <title>The Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT): an Adaptive Segmentation of the Open-Flux Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical observations of solar corona provide key information on its magnetic geometry. The large-scale open field of the corona plays an important role in shaping the ambient solar wind and constraining the propagation dynamics of the embedded structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections. Rigorous analysis of the open-flux coronal regions based on coronagraph images can be quite challenging because of the depleted plasma density resulting in low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we present an in-depth description of a new image segmentation methodology, the Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT), enabling a detection of field-aligned optical coronal features approximating the orientation of the steady-state open magnetic field. The methodology is tested using synthetic coronagraph images generated by a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model. The results of the numerical tests indicate that the extracted optical features are aligned within $\sim 4-7$ degrees with the local magnetic field in the underlying numerical solution. We also demonstrate the performance of the method on real-life coronal images obtained from a space-borne coronagraph and a ground-based camera. We argue that QRaFT outputs contain valuable empirical information about the global steady-state morphology of the corona which could help improving the accuracy of coronal and solar wind models and space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the photosphere oblateness of $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae via Stellar Intensity Interferometry with the VERITAS Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the stellar intensity interferometry system implemented with the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) as a light collector to obtain measurements of the rapid rotator star $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae, at a wavelength of 416 nm. Using data from baselines sampling different position angles, we extract the size, oblateness, and projected orientation of the photosphere. Fitting the data with a uniform ellipse model yields a minor-axis angular diameter of $0.43\pm0.02$ mas, a major-to-minor-radius ratio of $1.28\pm0.04$, and a position angle of $116^\circ\pm5^\circ$ for the axis of rotation. A rapidly-rotating stellar atmosphere model that includes limb and gravity darkening describes the data well with a fitted angular diameter of $0.604^{+0.041}_{-0.034}$ mas corresponding to an equatorial radius of 10.9$^{+0.8}_{-0.6}~R_\odot$, a rotational velocity with a $1~\sigma$ lower limit at $97.7\%$ that of breakup velocity, and a position angle of $114.7^{+6.4}_{-5.7}$ degrees. These parameters are consistent with H$\alpha$ line spectroscopy and infrared-wavelength Michelson interferometric measurements of the star's decretion disk. This is the first measurement of an oblate photosphere using intensity interferometry.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Full non-LTE multi-level radiative transfer I. An atom with three bound infinitely sharp levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) multi-level radiative transfer problem only takes into account the deviation of the radiation field and atomic populations from their equilibrium distribution. We aim to show how to solve for the full non-LTE (FNLTE) multi-level radiative transfer problem, also accounting for deviation of the velocity distribution of the massive particles from Maxwellian. We considered, as a first step, a three-level atom with zero natural broadening. In this work, we present a new numerical scheme. Its initialisation relies on the classic, multi-level approximate Lambda-iteration (MALI) method for the standard non-LTE problem. The radiative transfer equations, the kinetic equilibrium equations for atomic populations, and the Boltzmann equations for the velocity distribution functions were simultaneously iterated in order to obtain self-consistent particle distributions. During the process, the observer's frame absorption and emission profiles were re-computed at every iterative step by convolving the atomic frame quantities with the relevant velocity distribution function. We validate our numerical strategy by comparing our results with the standard non-LTE solutions in the limit of a two-level atom with Hummer's partial redistribution in frequency, and with a three-level atom with complete redistribution. In this work, we considered the so-called cross-redistribution problem. We then show new FNLTE results for a simple three-level atom while evaluating the assumptions made for the emission and absorption profiles of the standard non-LTE problem with partial and cross-redistribution.</description>

      <title>Testing the asteroseismic estimates of stellar radii with surface brightness-colour relations and {\it Gaia} DR3 parallaxes. III. Main-sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the radii derived from the asteroseismic scaling relations with those from surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) combined with the Gaia DR3 parallaxes for main-sequence (MS) stars. The atmospheric and asteroseismic parameters were sourced from the recently released KEYSTONE catalogue and matched to Gaia DR3 and TESS Input Catalog v8.2. We computed SBCR-based radii using two different SBCRs, and estimated their relative differences with respect to radius estimates from asteroseismic grid-based methods. We find a good agreement between SBCR and asteroseismic radii, with mean relative differences in radii ($E_g$) in the range 2% to 3% and a standard deviation of about 3%. We find no dependence on parallax, and a mild dependence on [Fe/H] for one of the SBCRs tested. We find a negative correlation between $E_g$ and the stellar mass, with a slope varying from $-0.051\pm0.016$ to $-0.039\pm0.014$ per solar mass. This change in slope led to a roughly 1.5% larger discrepancy in the $E_g$ estimates for stars with masses below 1.0 $M_{\odot}$. This larger discrepancy at the low-mass end supports conclusions drawn from giant star studies. This result is independently corroborated by the LEGACY sample, which uses Kepler photometry. For the LEGACY sample we measure a mean relative offset in $E_g$ of -1.4% with a standard deviation of 2.3%, and a dependence of $E_g$ on mass with a slope of $-0.052\pm0.011$ per mass unit, both fully consistent with the KEYSTONE analysis. The [...] apparent mass dependence still requires closer examination. This result is reassuring as it demonstrates the great accuracy and reliability of the radius estimates obtained through SBCRs, which, moreover, offer the significant advantage of being applicable to a large sample of stars with substantially lower time and costs compared to what is required by asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Energy budget in the 2017-09-07 "cold" solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subclass of early impulsive solar flares, cold flares, was proposed to represent a clean case, where the release of the free magnetic energy (almost) entirely goes to acceleration of the nonthermal electrons, while the observed thermal response is entirely driven by the nonthermal energy deposition to the ambient plasma. This paper studies one more example of a cold flare, which was observed by a unique combination of instruments. In particular, this is the first cold flare observed with the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and, thus, for which the dynamical measurement of the coronal magnetic field and other parameters at the flare site is possible. With these new data, we quantified the coronal magnetic field at the flare site, but did not find statistically significant variations of the magnetic field within the measurement uncertainties. We estimated that the uncertainty in the corresponding magnetic energy exceeds the thermal and nonthermal energies by an order of magnitude; thus, there should be sufficient free energy to drive the flare. We discovered a very prominent soft-hard-soft spectral evolution of the microwave-producing nonthermal electrons. We computed energy partitions and concluded that the nonthermal energy deposition is likely sufficient to drive the flare thermal response similarly to other cold flares.</description>

      <title>Fast automated adjoints for spectral PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general and automated approach for computing model gradients for PDE solvers built on sparse spectral methods, and implement this capability in the widely used open-source Dedalus framework. We apply reverse-mode automatic differentiation to symbolic graph representations of PDEs, efficiently constructing adjoint solvers that retain the speed and memory efficiency of this important class of modern numerical methods. This approach enables users to compute gradients and perform optimization for a wide range of time-dependent and nonlinear systems without writing additional code. The framework supports a broad class of equations, geometries, and boundary conditions, and runs efficiently in parallel using MPI. We demonstrate the flexibility and capabilities of this system using canonical problems from the literature, showing both strong performance and practical utility for a wide variety of inverse problems. By integrating automatic adjoints into a flexible high-level solver, our approach enables researchers to perform gradient-based optimization and sensitivity analyses in spectral simulations with ease and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A NICER view of the 1.4 solar-mass edge-on pulsar PSR J0614--3329</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four neutron star radius measurements have already been obtained by modeling the X-ray pulses of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). We report here the radius measurement of PSR J0614$-$3329 employing the same method with NICER and XMM-Newton data using Bayesian Inference. For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\sim 300\,$m.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in the Pillars of Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to dust grain alignment with magnetic fields, dust polarization observations of far-infrared emission from cold molecular clouds are often used to trace magnetic fields, allowing a probe of the effects of magnetic fields on the star formation process. We present inferred magnetic field maps of the Pillars of Creation region within the larger M16 emission nebula, derived from dust polarization data in the 89 and 154 micron continuum using SOFIA/HAWC+. We derive magnetic field strength estimates using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We compare the polarization and magnetic field strengths to column densities and dust continuum intensities across the region to build a coherent picture of the relationship between star forming activity and magnetic fields in the region. The projected magnetic field strengths derived are in the range of 50-130 microGauss, which is typical for clouds of similar n(H2), i.e., molecular hydrogen volume density on the order of 10^4-10^5 cm^(-3). We conclude that star formation occurs in the finger tips when the magnetic fields are too weak to prevent radial collapse due to gravity but strong enough to oppose OB stellar radiation pressure, while in the base of the fingers the magnetic fields hinder mass accretion and consequently star formation. We also support an initial weak field model (&lt;50 microGauss) with subsequent strengthening through realignment and compression, resulting in a dynamically important magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Orbit of WASP-4 b is in Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WASP-4 b is a hot Jupiter exhibiting a decreasing orbital period, prompting investigations into potential mechanisms driving its evolution. We analyzed 173 transit light curves, including 37 new observations, and derived mid-transit timings with EXOFAST, forming the most extensive TTV dataset for this system. Adding 58 literature timings and removing unreliable data, we constructed a TTV diagram with 216 points. Our analysis considered linear, quadratic, and apsidal motion models, with the quadratic model proving to be significantly superior in all model comparison statistics. We found no significant periodic signals in the data. The quadratic model allows us to infer a tidal quality factor of Q' ~ 80,000 from the orbital decay rate if this is due to stellar tides. Theoretical considerations indicate that such efficient dissipation is possible due to internal gravity waves in the radiative core of WASP-4, but only in our models with a more evolved host star, possibly near the end of its main-sequence lifetime, and with a larger radius than the observed one. Our main-sequence models produce only about a third of the required dissipation (Q' ~ 200,000 - 500,000). Therefore, the observed orbital decay can only be explained by a slightly larger or more evolved host, resembling the case for WASP-12. Our findings highlight the need for further stellar modeling and improvement in our current understanding of tidal dissipation mechanisms driving orbital decay in close-in exoplanetary systems.</description>

Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of five Type Ibn supernovae (SNe): SN 2020nxt, SN 2020taz, SN 2021bbv, SN 2023utc, and SN 2024aej. These events share key observational features and belong to a family of objects similar to the prototypical Type Ibn SN 2006jc. The SNe exhibit rise times of approximately 10 days and peak absolute magnitudes ranging from $-$16.5 to $-$19 mag. Notably, SN 2023utc is the faintest Type Ibn supernova discovered to date, with an exceptionally low r-band absolute magnitude of $-16.4$ mag. The pseudo-bolometric light curves peak at $(1-10) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with total radiated energies on the order of $(1-10) \times 10^{48}$ erg. Spectroscopically, these SNe display relatively slow spectral evolution; the early spectra are characterised by a hot blue continuum and prominent He I emission lines. Early spectra show blackbody temperatures exceeding $10000~\mathrm{K}$, with a subsequent decline in temperature during later phases. Narrow He I lines, indicative of unshocked circumstellar material (CSM), show velocities of approximately $1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. The spectra suggest that the progenitors of these SNe underwent significant mass loss prior to the explosion, resulting in a He-rich CSM. Light curve modelling yields estimates for the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) in the range $1-3~M_{\odot}$, with kinetic energies ($E_{\rm Kin}$) of $(0.1-1) \times 10^{50}$ erg. The inferred CSM mass ranges from $0.2$ to $1~M_{\odot}$. These findings are consistent with expectations for core-collapse events arising from relatively massive, envelope-stripped progenitors.</description>

      <title>ALMASOP. A Rotating Feature Rich in Complex Organic Molecules in a Protostellar Core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) in solar-like young stellar objects (YSOs), particularly within protostellar disks, are of significant interest due to their potential connection to prebiotic chemistry in emerging planetary systems. We report the discovery of a rotating feature enriched in COMs, including CH3OH, CH3CHO, and NH2CHO, in the protostellar core G192.12-11.10. By constructing a YSO model, we find that the COM-rich feature is likely located within or near the boundary of the Keplerian disk. The image synthesis results suggest that additional heating mechanisms leading to a warm ring or a warm inner disk are required to reproduce the observed emission. We discuss possible origins of the COM-rich feature, particularly accretion shocks as a plausible cause for a warm ring. Additionally, molecules such as C18O, H2CO, DCS, H2S, and OCS exhibit distinct behavior compared to CH3OH, indicating a range of physical and chemical conditions within the region. The observed kinematics of H2S and OCS suggest that OCS resides in regions closer to the central protostar than H2S, consistent with previous experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity nova explosions: a site for weak rp-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical novae are common cataclysmic events involving a binary system of a white dwarf and a main sequence or red giant companion star. In metal-poor environments, these explosions produce ejecta different from their solar counterparts due to the accretion of sub-solar metallicity material onto the white dwarf. In particular, it has been suggested that the nucleosynthesis flow in such low-metallicity nova explosions extends up to the Cu-Zn region, much beyond the expected endpoint, around Ca, predicted for solar-metallicity classical novae. This behavior resembles a weak rp-process, and such nuclear activity has never been observed in accreting white dwarf binaries with typical accretion flows. In this work, we study the characteristics of the weak rp-process for four nova models with metallicities $Z= 2\times 10^{-9}$, $10^{-7}$, $2\times 10^{-6}$, and $2\times 10^{-5}$, and explore the impact of the nuclear physics uncertainties via a Monte Carlo sensitivity study. We identify nuclear reactions whose uncertainties affect the production of intermediate-mass nuclei under these conditions. These reactions and relevant nuclear quantities are targets for measurements at stable or radioactive beam facilities to reduce their rate uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength study of observed and predicted pulsation properties of First overtone Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the light curves and pulsation properties of First Overtone (FO) Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) obtained using observations and predictions from stellar pulsation models. Multiwavelength observational light curves were compiled from the literature (OGLE-IV, Gaia and VMC). We investigate the period-amplitude (PA), period-colour (PC), period-luminosity (PL), and amplitude-colour (AC) relations for FO Cepheids at multiwavelengths. We find that the PA distribution of FO Cepheids in the MCs modelled using a Gaussian Mixture Model shows that the SMC consists of higher amplitude stars than the LMC. We find multiple break-points in the PC/PL/AC relations for FO/FU Cepheids in the optical and near-infrared bands including the one near to P = 2.5 d in the MCs using piecewise regression analysis and F- test statistics. Similarly, for the LMC FO Cepheids, we find a break-point in the PC/PL/AC relations near P = 0.58 d. The slopes of the PC relations for LMC FO Cepheids are found to be shallow for 0.58 &lt; P(d) &lt; 2.5 but steeper for P &lt; 0.58 d and P &gt; 2.5 d. We complemented the observed relations using theoretical models for FO Cepheids with chemical compositions Z = 0.008 and Z = 0.004, appropriate for the LMC and SMC, respectively computed with MESA-RSP. Our results show that the pulsation properties of FO Cepheids in PC/PL/AC relations and colour-magnitude diagram are strongly correlated and their connections can provide stringent constraints for the theoretical pulsation models.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Trappist-1 exoplanets with coronal mass ejections: Joule heating, Poynting fluxes and the role of magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flares and associated Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are energetic stellar phenomena that shape the space weather around planets. Close-in exoplanets orbiting active cool stars are likely exposed to extreme space weather whose effects on the planets are not understood well enough. The terrestrial Trappist-1 exoplanets are excellent targets to study the impact of CMEs on close-in planets and their atmospheres. We study the role of planetary magnetic fields in shielding the planet from external forcing. We expand on recent studies of CME-induced Joule heating of planetary interiors and atmospheres by including a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the interaction. We study the interaction of CMEs with Tr-1b &amp; e using MHD simulations. We consider magnetic flux rope and density pulse CMEs. We calculate induction heating in the planetary interior and ionospheric Joule heating for various intrinsic magnetic field strengths and CME energies. Magnetospheric compression is the main driver of magnetic variability. Planetary magnetic fields enhance induction heating in the interior although the effect is weaker with flux rope CMEs. Single event dissipation rates with 1-hour CMEs amount to 20 TW and 1 TW for Trappist-1b and e, respectively. Taking CME occurrence rates into account, annual average heating rates are ~10 TW (b) and ~1 TW (e), which are placed near the lower end of previous estimates. Within the range of studied planetary magnetic field strengths $B_p$, magnetospheric Poynting fluxes scale with $B_p^3$. Thus, stronger magnetic fields increase CME energy absorption. Ionospheric Joule heating rates amount to $10^{3-4}$ TW and decrease for stronger magnetic fields $B_p$. These heating rates exceed the average stellar XUV input by 1-2 orders of magnitude and might severely impact atmospheric erosion. In a steady state stellar wind ionospheric Joule heating amounts to ~$10^2$ TW.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Milky Way: Calibrating chemical ages with high-precision Kepler data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical clocks offer a powerful tool for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic surveys. We present a new detailed spectroscopic analysis of 68 Kepler red giant stars to provide a suite of high-precision abundances along with asteroseismic ages with better than 10 percent precision from individual mode frequencies. We obtained several chemical clocks as ratios between s-process elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce) and alpha-elements (Mg, Ca, Si, Al, Ti). Our data show that [Ce/Mg] and [Zr/Ti] display a remarkably tight correlation with stellar ages, with abundance dispersions of 0.08 and 0.01 dex respectively and below 3 Gyr in ages, across the entire Galactic chronochemical history. While improving the precision floor of spectroscopic surveys is critical for broadening the scope and applicability of chemical clocks, the intrinsic accuracy of our relations -- enabled by high-resolution chemical abundances and stellar ages in our sample -- allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about age trends across stellar populations. By applying our relations to the APOGEE and Gaia-ESO surveys, we are able to differentiate the low- and high-alpha sequences in age, recover the age-metallicity relation, observe the disc flaring of the Milky Way, and identify a population of old metal-rich stars.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster ESO 280-SC06: A Formerly Massive, Tidally Disrupted Globular Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first high-resolution abundance study of ESO 280-SC06, one of the least luminous and most metal-poor gravitationally bound Milky Way globular clusters. Using Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for ten stars, we confirm the cluster's low metallicity as [Fe/H] = $-2.54 \pm 0.06$ and the presence of a nitrogen-enhanced star enriched by binary mass transfer. We determine abundances or abundance upper limits for 21 additional elements from the light, alpha, odd-Z, iron peak, and neutron-capture groups for all ten stars. We find no spread in neutron-capture elements, unlike previous trends identified in some metal-poor globular clusters such as M15 and M92. Eight of the ten stars have light-element abundance patterns consistent with second-population globular cluster stars, which is a significantly larger second-population fraction than would be expected from the low present-day mass of $10^{4.1}$ Msun. We estimate the initial mass of the cluster as $10^{5.4 - 5.7}$ Msun based on its orbit in the Milky Way. A preferential loss of first-population stars could explain the high fraction of second-population stars at the present time. Our results emphasize the importance of considering mass loss when studying globular clusters and their enrichment patterns.</description>

      <title>A topological approach to magnetic nulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic nulls are locations where the magnetic field vanishes. Nulls are the location of magnetic reconnection, and they determine to a large degree the magnetic connectivity in a system. We describe a novel approach to understanding movement, appearance, and disappearance of nulls in magnetic fields. This approach is based on the concept of isotropes, or lines where the field direction is constant. These lines are streamlines of a vector field whose flux is sourced by the topological indices of nulls, and can be conceptualized as corresponding "lines of force" between nulls. We show how this topological approach can be used to generate analytical expressions for the location of nulls in the presence of external fields for dipoles and for a field defined by the Hopf fibration.</description>
