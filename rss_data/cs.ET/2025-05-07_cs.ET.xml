      <title>Blockchain Data Analytics: A Scoping Literature Review and Directions for Future Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has rapidly expanded beyond its original use in cryptocurrencies to a broad range of applications, creating vast amounts of immutable, decentralized data. As blockchain adoption grows, so does the need for advanced data analytics techniques to extract insights for business intelligence, fraud detection, financial analysis and many more. While previous research has examined specific aspects of blockchain data analytics, such as transaction patterns, illegal activity detection, and data management, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews that explore the full scope of blockchain data analytics. This study addresses this gap through a scoping literature review, systematically mapping the existing research landscape, identifying key topics, and highlighting emerging trends. Using established methodologies for literature reviews, we analyze 466 publications, clustering them into six major research themes: illegal activity detection, data management, financial analysis, user analysis, community detection, and mining analysis. Our findings reveal a strong focus on detecting illicit activities and financial applications, while holistic business intelligence use cases remain underexplored. This review provides a structured overview of blockchain data analytics, identifying research gaps and proposing future directions to enhance the fields impact.</description>

      <title>Advanced Clustering Framework for Semiconductor Image Analytics Integrating Deep TDA with Self-Supervised and Transfer Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing generates vast amounts of image data, crucial for defect identification and yield optimization, yet often exceeds manual inspection capabilities. Traditional clustering techniques struggle with high-dimensional, unlabeled data, limiting their effectiveness in capturing nuanced patterns. This paper introduces an advanced clustering framework that integrates deep Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with self-supervised and transfer learning techniques, offering a novel approach to unsupervised image clustering. TDA captures intrinsic topological features, while self-supervised learning extracts meaningful representations from unlabeled data, reducing reliance on labeled datasets. Transfer learning enhances the framework's adaptability and scalability, allowing fine-tuning to new datasets without retraining from scratch. Validated on synthetic and open-source semiconductor image datasets, the framework successfully identifies clusters aligned with defect patterns and process variations. This study highlights the transformative potential of combining TDA, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning, providing a scalable solution for proactive process monitoring and quality control in semiconductor manufacturing and other domains with large-scale image datasets.</description>

      <title>KERAIA: An Adaptive and Explainable Framework for Dynamic Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KERAIA, a novel framework and software platform for symbolic knowledge engineering designed to address the persistent challenges of representing, reasoning with, and executing knowledge in dynamic, complex, and context-sensitive environments. The central research question that motivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be effectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI systems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on foundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while introducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for dynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive inheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and Cloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation paradigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle, ensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of LoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation language, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse inference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility, expressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of multiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics in water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge representation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and knowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational considerations of the KERAIA platform.</description>

      <title>Verification of Digital Twins using Classical and Statistical Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of digital techniques, the concept of digital twin (DT) has received a widespread attention in both industry and academia. While several definitions exist for a DT, most definitions focus on the existence of a virtual entity (VE) of a real-world object or process, often comprising interconnected models which interact with each other, undergoing changes continuously owing to the synchronization with the real-world object. These interactions might lead to inconsistencies at execution time, due to their highly stochastic and/or time-critical nature, which may lead to undesirable behavior. In addition, the continuously varying nature of VE owing to its synchronization with the real-world object further contributes to the complexity arising from these interactions and corresponding model execution times, which could possibly affect its overall functioning at runtime. This creates a need to perform (continuous) verification of the VE, to ensure that it behaves consistently at runtime by adhering to desired properties such as deadlock freeness, functional correctness, liveness and timeliness. Some critical properties such as deadlock freeness can only be verified using classical model checking; on the other hand, statistical model checking provides the possibility to model actual stochastic temporal behavior. We therefore propose to use both these techniques to verify the correctness and the fulfillment of desirable properties of VE. We present our observations and findings from applying these techniques on the DT of an autonomously driving truck. Results from these verification techniques suggest that this DT adheres to properties of deadlock freeness and functional correctness, but not adhering to timeliness properties.</description>

      <title>Flexing RISC-V Instruction Subset Processors (RISPs) to Extreme Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for automatically generating processors that support a subset of the RISC-V instruction set for a new class of applications at Extreme Edge. The electronics used in extreme edge applications must be power-efficient, but also provide additional qualities, such as low cost, conformability, comfort and sustainability. Flexible electronics, rather than silicon-based electronics, will be capable of meeting these qualities. For this purpose, we propose a methodology to generate RISPs (RISC-V instruction subset processors) customised to extreme edge applications and to implement them as flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs). The methodology is unique in the sense that verification is an integral part of design. The RISP methodology treats each instruction in the ISA as a discrete, fully functional, pre-verified hardware block. It automatically builds a custom processor by stitching together the hardware blocks of the instructions required by an application or a set of applications in a specific domain. This approach significantly reduces the processor verification and its time-to-market. We generate RISPs using this methodology for three extreme edge applications, and embedded applications from the Embench benchmark suite, synthesize them as FlexICs, and compare their power, performance and area to the baselines. Our results show that RISPs generated using this methodology achieve, on average, 30\% reductions in power and area compared to a RISC-V processor supporting the full instruction set when synthesized, and are nearly 30 times more energy efficient with respect to Serv - the world's smallest 32-bit RISC-V processor. In addition, the full physical implementation of RISPs show up to 21% and 26% less area and power than Serv.</description>

      <title>Scalable Connectivity for Ising Machines: Dense to Sparse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, hardware implementations of Ising machines have emerged as a viable alternative to quantum computing for solving hard optimization problems among other applications. Unlike quantum hardware, dense connectivity can be achieved in classical systems. However, we show that dense connectivity leads to severe frequency slowdowns and interconnect congestion scaling unfavorably with system sizes. As a scalable solution, we propose a systematic sparsification method for dense graphs by introducing copy nodes to limit the number of neighbors per graph node. In addition to solving interconnect congestion, this approach enables constant frequency scaling where all spins in a network can be updated in constant time. On the other hand, sparsification introduces new difficulties, such as constraint-breaking between copied spins and increased convergence times to solve optimization problems, especially if exact ground states are sought. Relaxing the exact solution requirements, we find that the overheads in convergence times are milder. We demonstrate these ideas by designing probabilistic bit Ising machines using ASAP7 (a predictive 7nm FinFET technology model) process design kits as well as Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based implementations. Finally, we show how formulating problems in naturally sparse networks (e.g., by invertible logic) sidesteps challenges introduced by sparsification methods. Our results are applicable to a broad family of Ising machines using different hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes, which are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that can be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the total travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum approach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using D-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance computational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively reduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this reduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for quantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and innovative approach for solving the STSP.</description>

      <title>Towards a HIPAA Compliant Agentic AI System in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight. However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.</description>
