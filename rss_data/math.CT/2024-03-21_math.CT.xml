      <title>Simplification &amp; Incidence: How an Incidence-focused Perspective Patches Category-theoretic Problems in Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying simplification operations to categories of multigraphs, several natural graph operations are shown to demonstrate categorical issues. The replacement of an undirected edge with a directed cycle for digraphs admits both a left and a right adjoint, while the analogous operation for quivers only admits a left adjoint. The clique-replacement graph, intersection graph, and dual hypergraph fail to be functorial with traditional graph homomorphisms. The three failures are remedied by considering weak set-system homomorphisms, which form a category isomorphic to both the category of incidence structures and a lax comma category.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Components of Deep Learning: A category-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning, despite its remarkable achievements, is still a young field. Like the early stages of many scientific disciplines, it is marked by the discovery of new phenomena, ad-hoc design decisions, and the lack of a uniform and compositional mathematical foundation. From the intricacies of the implementation of backpropagation, through a growing zoo of neural network architectures, to the new and poorly understood phenomena such as double descent, scaling laws or in-context learning, there are few unifying principles in deep learning. This thesis develops a novel mathematical foundation for deep learning based on the language of category theory. We develop a new framework that is a) end-to-end, b) unform, and c) not merely descriptive, but prescriptive, meaning it is amenable to direct implementation in programming languages with sufficient features. We also systematise many existing approaches, placing many existing constructions and concepts from the literature under the same umbrella. In Part I we identify and model two main properties of deep learning systems parametricity and bidirectionality by we expand on the previously defined construction of actegories and Para to study the former, and define weighted optics to study the latter. Combining them yields parametric weighted optics, a categorical model of artificial neural networks, and more. Part II justifies the abstractions from Part I, applying them to model backpropagation, architectures, and supervised learning. We provide a lens-theoretic axiomatisation of differentiation, covering not just smooth spaces, but discrete settings of boolean circuits as well. We survey existing, and develop new categorical models of neural network architectures. We formalise the notion of optimisers and lastly, combine all the existing concepts together, providing a uniform and compositional framework for supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Computads for weak $\omega$-categories as an inductive type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new description of computads for weak globular $\omega$-categories by giving an explicit inductive definition of the free words. This yields a new understanding of computads, and allows a new definition of $\omega$-category that avoids the technology of globular operads. Our framework permits direct proofs of important results via structural induction, and we use this to give new proofs that every $\omega$-category is equivalent to a free one, and that the category of computads with generator-preserving maps is a presheaf topos, giving a direct description of the index category. We prove that our resulting definition of $\omega$-category agrees with that of Batanin and Leinster and that the induced notion of cofibrant replacement for $\omega$-categories coincides with that of Garner.</description>

      <title>The finite presentation of the stable Hom functors, the Bass torsion, and the cotorsion coradical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the stable Hom functors to be finitely presented. When the covariant Hom functor modulo projectives is finitely presented, its defect is isomorphic to the Bass torsion of the fixed argument. When the contravariant Hom functor modulo injectives is finitely presented, its defect is isomorphic to the cotorsion of the fixed argument. We also give a sufficient condition for the sub-stabilization of the tensor product to be finitely presented. A finite presentation of the tensor product leads to an unexpected application.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of natural directed paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the abstract setting of presheaf category on a thick category of cubes. Precubical sets, symmetric transverse sets, symmetric precubical sets and the new category of (non-symmetric) transverse sets are examples of this structure. All these presheaf categories share the same metric and homotopical properties from a directed homotopy point of view. This enables us to extend Raussen's notion of natural $d$-path for each of them. Finally, we adapt Ziemia\'{n}ski's notion of cube chain to this abstract setting and we prove that it has the expected behavior on precubical sets. As an application, we verify that the formalization of the parallel composition with synchronization of process algebra using the coskeleton functor of the category of symmetric transverse sets has a category of cube chains with the correct homotopy type.</description>

      <title>Sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a functorial presentation of the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $(n, r)$-categories for all $-2 \leq n\leq\infty$ and $0 \leq r\leq n+2$ based on complete Segal space objects. In this definition, the equivalences of sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories are defined inductively, so we also provide a localisation at the coinductive equivalences to define the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $\omega$-categories as well. We prove that the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories and the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $\omega$-categories both define distributors over the underlying topos of sheaves of spaces. Moreover, we show that these distributors define terminal and initial fixed points with respect to the construction of complete Segal space objects in a distributor. We conclude with a sheafification result: the category of sheaves of $(n, r)$-categories over a site $\mathscr{C}$ can be presented as a strongly reflective localisation of $\mathbf{Fun}(\mathscr{C}^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Cat}_{(n, r)})$, where the localisation functor preserves fibre products over $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathscr{C})$, with the analogous result also holding for sheaves of $\omega$-categories.</description>

      <title>Non-accessible localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a 2005 paper, Casacuberta, Scevenels and Smith construct a homotopy idempotent functor $E$ on the category of simplicial sets with the property that whether it can be expressed as localization with respect to a map $f$ is independent of the ZFC axioms. We show that this construction can be carried out in homotopy type theory. More precisely, we give a general method of associating to a suitable (possibly large) family of maps, a reflective subuniverse of any universe $\mathcal{U}$. When specialized to an appropriate family, this produces a localization which when interpreted in the $\infty$-topos of spaces agrees with the localization corresponding to $E$. Our approach generalizes the approach of [CSS] in two ways. First, by working in homotopy type theory, our construction can be interpreted in any $\infty$-topos. Second, while the local objects produced by [CSS] are always 1-types, our construction can produce $n$-types, for any $n$. This is new, even in the $\infty$-topos of spaces. In addition, by making use of universes, our proof is very direct.
  Along the way, we prove many results about "small" types that are of independent interest. As an application, we give a new proof that separated localizations exist. We also give results that say when a localization with respect to a family of maps can be presented as localization with respect to a single map, and show that the simplicial model satisfies a strong form of the axiom of choice which implies that sets cover and that the law of excluded middle holds.</description>

      <title>Simples in a cotilting heart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every cotilting module over a ring R induces a t-structure with a Grothendieck heart in the derived category D(Mod R). We determine the simple objects in this heart and their injective envelopes, combining torsion-theoretic aspects with methods from the model theory of modules and Auslander-Reiten theory.</description>
