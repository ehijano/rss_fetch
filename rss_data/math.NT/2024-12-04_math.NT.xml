      <title>On extreme values of $r_3(n)$ in arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given integer $m$ and any residue $a \pmod{m}$ that can be written as a sum of 3 squares modulo $m$, we show the existence of infinitely many integers $n \equiv a \pmod{m}$ such that the number of representations of $n$ as a sum of three squares, $r_3(n)$, satisfies $r_3(n) \gg_m \sqrt{n} \log \log n$. Consequently, we establish that there are infinitely many integers $n \equiv a \pmod{m}$ for which the Hurwitz class number $H(n)$ also satisfies $H(n) \gg_m \sqrt{n} \log \log n$.</description>

      <title>On sums of Egyptian fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n,d$, and $k$ be positive integers where $n$ and $d$ are coprime. Our two main results are
  Theorem 1. There is a partition of the infinite interval $[kd,\infty)$ of positive integers into a family of finite sets $X$ for which the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $X$ is $n/d$.
  Theorem 1. There is a partition of $[2kd,\infty)$ into an infinite family of infinite sets $Y$ for which the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $Y$ is $n/d$.
  Our method is grounded in the Vital Identity, $1/z = 1/(z+1) + 1/z(z+1)$, which holds for every complex number $z \notin \{-1,0\}$, and which gives rise to an eponymous algorithm that serves as our tool. At the core of our Theorems 1 and 2 is the number theoretic function $\star: x\mapsto \star x := x(x+1)$ into whose properties this paper continues an investigation initiated in [7].</description>

      <title>An illustrated introduction to the arithmetic of Apollonian circle packings, continued fractions, and other thin orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes cover and expand upon the material for two summer schools: The first, which was held at CIRM, Marseille, France, July 10-14, 2023, as part of "Renormalization and Visualization for packing, billiard and surfaces", was titled "Number theory as a door to geometry, dynamics and illustration". The second was held at NSU IMS in Singapore, June 3-7, 2024, as part of "Computational Aspects of Thin Groups", and was titled "Integral packings and number theory". Both courses were put together by a number theorist for students and researchers in other fields. They cover a web of ideas relating to Apollonian circle packings, integral orbits, thin groups, hyperbolic geometry, continued fractions, and Diophantine approximation. The connection of geometry and dynamics to number theory gives an opportunity to illustrate arithmetic by appealing to our visual intuition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N(\sigma,T)$ denote the number of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function with real part greater than $\sigma$ and imaginary part lying between $0$ and $T$. In this article, we provide an explicit version of Carlson's zero density estimate, that is, $N(\sigma, T) \leq 0.78 T^{4 \sigma (1- \sigma)} (\log T)^{5-2 \sigma} $, with a slight improvement in the exponent of the logarithm factor.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the reciprocal and shifted quotient of the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p(n)$ denote the partition function. In this paper our main goal is to derive an asymptotic expansion up to order $N$ (for any fixed positive integer $N$) along with estimates for error bounds for the shifted quotient of the partition function, namely $p(n+k)/p(n)$ with $k\in \mathbb{N}$, which generalizes a result of Gomez, Males, and Rolen. In order to do so, we derive asymptotic expansions with error bounds for the shifted version $p(n+k)$ and the multiplicative inverse $1/p(n)$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Kolyvagin's conjecture for modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main result in this article is a proof (under mild technical assumptions) of an analogue for $p$-adic Galois representations attached to a newform $f$ of even weight $k\geq4$ of Kolyvagin's conjecture on the $p$-indivisibility of derived Heegner points on elliptic curves, where $p$ is a prime number that is ordinary for $f$. Our strategy, which is inspired by work of W. Zhang in weight $2$, is based on a variant for modular forms of the congruence method originally introduced by Bertolini-Darmon to prove one divisibility in the anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for rational elliptic curves. We adapt to higher (even) weight modular forms this approach via congruences, building crucially on results of Wang on the indivisibility of Heegner cycles over Shimura curves. Then we offer an application of our results on Kolyvagin's conjecture to the Tamagawa number conjecture for the motive of $f$ and describe other (standard) consequences on structure theorems for Bloch-Kato-Selmer groups, $p$-parity results and converse theorems for $f$. Since in the present paper we need $p&gt;k+1$, our main theorem and its applications can be viewed as complementary to results obtained by the first and third authors in their article on the Tamagawa number conjecture for modular motives, where Kolyvagin's conjecture was proved (in a completely different way exploiting the arithmetic of Hida families) under the assumption that $k$ is congruent to $2$ modulo $2(p-1)$, which forces $p&lt;k$. In forthcoming work, we will use results contained in this paper to prove (under analogous assumptions) the counterpart for an even weight newform $f$ of Perrin-Riou's Heegner point main conjecture for elliptic curves ("Heegner cycle main conjecture" for $f$).</description>

      <title>Normality of algebraic numbers and the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real number is called simply normal to base $b$ if every digit $0,1,\ldots ,b-1$ should appear in its $b$-adic expansion with the same frequency $1/b$. A real number is called normal to base $b$ if it is simply normal to every base $b, b^2, \ldots$. In this article, we discover a relation between the normality of algebraic numbers and a mean of the Riemann zeta function on vertical arithmetic progressions. Consequently, we reveal that a positive algebraic irrational number $\alpha$ is normal to base $b$ if and only if we have \[ \lim_{N\to \infty}\frac{1}{\log N} \sum_{1\leq |n|\leq N} \zeta\left(-k+\frac{2\pi i n}{\log b} \right) \frac{e^{2\pi i n \log \alpha /\log b}}{n^{k+1}} =0 \] for every integer $k\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>The convergence Newton polygon of a $p$-adic differential equation IV : controlling graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous works we proved a finiteness property of the radii of convergence functions associated with a vector bundle with connection on $p$-adic analytic curves. We showed that the radii are locally constant functions outside a locally finite graph in the curve, called controlling graph. In this paper we refine that finiteness results by giving a bound on the size of the controlling graph in terms of the geometry of the curve and the rank of the module. This is based on super-harmonicity properties of radii of convergence and partial heights of the Newton polygon. Under suitable assumptions, we relate the size of the controlling graph associated with the total height of the convergence Newton polygon to the Euler characteristic in the sense of de Rham cohomology.</description>

Abstract: Let $C_\ell/\mathbb Q$ denote the curve with affine model $y^\ell=x(x^\ell-1)$, where $\ell\geq 3$ is prime. In this paper we study the limiting distributions of the normalized $L$-polynomials of the curves by computing their Sato-Tate groups and distributions. We also provide results for the number of points on the curves over finite fields, including a formula in terms of Jacobi sums when the field $\mathbb F_q$ satisfies $q\equiv 1 \pmod{\ell^2}$.</description>

      <title>Density formulas for $p$-adically bounded primes for hypergeometric series with rational and quadratic irrational parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study densities of $p$-adically bounded primes for hypergeometric series in two cases: the case of generalized hypergeometric series with rational parameters, and the case of $_2F_1$ with parameters in a quadratic extension of the rational numbers. In the rational case we extend work from $_2F_1$ to $_nF_{n-1}$ for an exact formula giving the density of bounded primes for the series. The density is shown to be one exactly in accordance with the case of finite monodromy as classified by Beukers-Heckmann. In the quadratic irrational case, we obtain an unconditional lower bound on the density of bounded primes. Assuming the normality of the $p$-adic digits of quadratic irrationalities, this lower bound is shown to be an exact formula for the density of bounded primes. In the quadratic irrational case, there is a trivial upper bound of $1/2$ on the density of bounded primes. In the final section of the paper we discuss some results and computations on series that attain this bound. In particular, all such examples we have found are associated to imaginary quadratic fields, though we do not prove this is always the case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we strongly improve asymptotics for $s_1(n)$ (respectively $s_2(n)$) which sums reciprocals (respectively squares of reciprocals) of parts throughout all the partitions of $n$ into distinct parts. The methods required are much more involved than in the case of usual partitions since the generating functions are not modular and also do not posses product expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ceresa cycle is a canonical algebraic $1$-cycle on the Jacobian of an algebraic curve. We construct an algorithm which, given a curve over a number field, often provides a certificate that the Ceresa cycle is non-torsion, without relying on the presence of any additional symmetries of the curve. Under the hypothesis that the Sato--Tate group is the whole of $\operatorname*{GSp}$, we prove that if the Ceresa class (the image of the Ceresa cycle in \'{e}tale cohomology) is non-torsion, then the algorithm will eventually terminate with a certificate attesting to this fact.</description>

      <title>Backtracking New Q-Newton's method for finding roots of meromorphic functions in 1 complex variable: Global convergence, and local stable/unstable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with $deg (P)&gt;deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an initial point $z_0$, not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point - but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial, the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by the authors. The dynamics of BNQN seems also to have some similarities (and differences) to the classical Leau-Fatou's flowers.</description>

Using perfectoid spaces we associate to any finite-dimensional continuous representation $\overline{\rho}$ of ${\rm Gal}(\overline K/K)$ over $\mathbb{F}$ an \'etale $(\varphi,\mathcal{O}_K^\times)$-module $D_A^\otimes(\overline{\rho})$ over a completed localization $A$ of $\mathbb{F}[\![\mathcal{O}_K]\!]$. We conjecture that one can also associate an \'etale $(\varphi,\mathcal{O}_K^\times)$-module $D_A(\pi)$ to any smooth representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ occurring in some Hecke eigenspace of the mod $p$ cohomology of a Shimura curve, and that moreover $D_A(\pi)$ is isomorphic (up to twist) to $D_A^\otimes(\overline{\rho})$, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the underlying $2$-dimensional representation of ${\rm Gal}(\overline K/K)$. Using previous work of the same authors, we prove this conjecture when $\overline{\rho}$ is semi-simple and sufficiently generic.</description>

      <title>An effective open image theorem for products of principally polarized abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11472v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A = \prod_{1\leq i\leq n} A_i$ be the product of principally polarized abelian varieties $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ of dimensions $g_1, \ldots, g_n$, respectively, each defined over a number field $K$, and pairwise nonisogenous over $\overline{K}$. We make effective an open image theorem for $A$ due to Hindry and Ratazzi. More specifically, we give an explicit bound of the constant $c(A)$ under GRH, in terms of standard invariants of $K$ and each $A_i$, where $c(A)$ is defined to be the smallest positive integer such that for any prime $\ell&gt;c(A)$, the image of the $\ell$-adic Galois representation of $A$ is "as large as possible" in a suitable sense.</description>

      <title>On the Glasner Property of Linear Maps with Prime Entries on Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantitative Glanser property in the context of maps between tori of differing dimension instead of as a (semi-)group action. We also only consider matrices with entries being non-constant polynomials evaluated at primes, extending on the work of Velani and Nair, and Bulinski and Fish to a more general setting.</description>

Abstract: Using a result of recursive function theory and results of the complex analysis of Takeuti, which is based on a type theory and the work of Kreisel, and which gives a conservative extension of first order Peano arithmetic (PA), assuming all critical zeros of the Riemann zeta function are simple, we show that RH is decidable in PA.</description>

      <title>A note on trigonometric polynomials for lower bounds of $\zeta(s)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-negative trigonometric polynomials satisfying certain properties are employed when studying a number of aspects of the Riemann zeta function. When establishing zero-free regions in the critical strip, the classical polynomial $3+4\cos(\theta)+\cos(2\theta)$ used by de la Vall\'ee Poussin has since been replaced by more beneficial polynomials with larger degree. The classical polynomial was also employed by Titchmarsh to provide a lower bound on $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|$ when $\sigma&gt;1$. We show that this polynomial is optimal for this purpose.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ be a $p$-primitive cusp form of level $p^{4r}$, where local representation of $f$ be supercuspidal at $p$, $p$ being an odd prime, $r\geq 1$ and $g$ be a Hecke-Maass or holomorphic primitive cusp form for $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. A subconvex bound for the central values of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions $L(s, f \otimes g )$ is give by $$L(\frac{1}{2}, f \otimes g ) \ll_{f,g,\epsilon}p^{\frac{23r}{12} +\epsilon}.$$</description>

      <title>Fourier transform of BV functions and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relation between the Fourier transform of {\rm BV} (bounded variation) functions and their jump sets. We introduce the notion of $L^2$-jump product and obtain a weighted Plancherel identity for {\rm BV} functions. As a corollary, we get a newfound characterization of sets of finite perimeter in terms of their Fourier transform. Moreover, we sharpen a result of Herz on the set-theoretic derivative of the Fourier transform of characteristic functions of sets. Last, we obtain sharp bounds on the quadratic discrepancy of {\rm BV} functions, and as a consequence, we generalize the classic estimates of Beck and Montgomery.</description>

      <title>On Brauer groups of tame stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop some general tools for computing the Brauer group of a tame algebraic stack $\mathscr X$ by studying the difference between it and the Brauer group of the coarse space $X$ of $\mathscr X$. It is our hope that these tools will be used to simplify future computations of Brauer groups of stacks. Informally, we show that $\operatorname{Br}\mathscr X$ is often built from $\operatorname{Br} X$ and "information about the Picard groups of the fibers of $\mathscr X\to X$''. Along these lines, we compute, for example, the Brauer group of the moduli stack $\mathscr Y(1)_S$ of elliptic curves, over any regular noetherian $\mathbb Z[1/2]$-scheme $S$ as well as the Brauer groups of (many) stacky curves (allowing generic stabilizers) over algebraically closed fields.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension of Weighted Singular Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$ using dynamics on homogeneous spaces, specifically the method of integral inequalities. Together with the lower bound proved recently by Kim and Park \cite{KimPark2024}, this determines the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors, thereby generalizing to arbitrary dimension, the work of Liao, Shi, Solan, and Tamam \cite{LSST}, who determined the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in two dimensions. We also provide the first known bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors restricted to fractal subsets.</description>

      <title>Points below a parabola in affine planes of prime order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elements of a finite field of prime order canonically correspond to the integers in an interval. This induces an ordering on the elements of the field. Using this ordering, Kiss and Somlai recently proved interesting properties of the set of points below the diagonal line. In this paper, we investigate the set of points lying below a parabola. We prove that in some sense, this set of points looks the same from all but two directions, despite having only one non-trivial automorphism. In addition, we study the sizes of these sets, and their intersection numbers with respect to lines.</description>

      <title>On Singh and Barman's Conjecture on Hook Length Biases in $t$-Regular Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$, where $t\geq 2$ and $k\geq 1$. Recently, Singh and Barman proved that $b_{3,2}(n)\geq b_{2,2}(n)$ for all $n\geq 4$. They also conjectured that $b_{t+1,2}(n)\geq b_{t,2}(n)$ for $t\geq 3$ and for all $n\geq 0$. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture is true for $t=3$.</description>
