      <title>Quasi Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Inference of Large Approximate Dynamic Factor Models via the EM algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.03821v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study estimation of large Dynamic Factor models implemented through the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, jointly with the Kalman smoother. We prove that as both the cross-sectional dimension, $n$, and the sample size, $T$, diverge to infinity: (i) the estimated loadings are $\sqrt T$-consistent, asymptotically normal and equivalent to their Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimates; (ii) the estimated factors are $\sqrt n$-consistent, asymptotically normal and equivalent to their Weighted Least Squares estimates. Moreover, the estimated loadings are asymptotically as efficient as those obtained by Principal Components analysis, while the estimated factors are more efficient if the idiosyncratic covariance is sparse enough.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Controls for Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies experimental design in settings where the experimental units are large aggregate entities (e.g., markets), and only one or a small number of units can be exposed to the treatment. In such settings, randomization of the treatment may result in treated and control groups with very different characteristics at baseline, inducing biases. We propose a variety of experimental non-randomized synthetic control designs (Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller, 2010, Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003) that select the units to be treated, as well as the untreated units to be used as a control group. Average potential outcomes are estimated as weighted averages of the outcomes of treated units for potential outcomes with treatment, and weighted averages the outcomes of control units for potential outcomes without treatment. We analyze the properties of estimators based on synthetic control designs and propose new inferential techniques. We show that in experimental settings with aggregate units, synthetic control designs can substantially reduce estimation biases in comparison to randomization of the treatment.</description>
