      <title>Metamaterial two-sphere Newton's cradle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally resonant metamaterials are among the most studied types of elastic/acoustic metamaterials, with significant research focused on wave propagation in a continuum of "meta-atoms" Here we investigate the collision dynamics of two identical pendulum-suspended mass-in-mass resonators, essentially a two-sphere Newton's cradle, emphasizing the readily realizable scenario where the internal resonator frequency is much greater than the pendulum frequency. We first show that the dynamics of a collision can be described using effective parameters, similar to how previous metamaterials research has characterized wave propagation through effective material properties. Non-conventional collision dynamics -- observed in two colliding mass-in-mass systems where one is initially at rest -- include behaviors such as the moving sphere rebounding as if from a fixed wall while the other remains essentially stationary, the spheres coupling and moving forward in near-unison, and the spheres recoiling in opposite directions. These responses can be achieved by tuning the effective parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters can take on values that differ significantly from those in a conventional Newton's cradle. Additionally, we investigate multiple collisions of the two spheres, revealing complex dynamics. This work paves the way for the development and study of new "collision-based metamaterial" structures.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal Dynamic Metasurface Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are an emerging technology for next-generation wireless base stations, distinguished by hybrid analog/digital beamforming capabilities with low hardware complexity. However, the coupling between meta-atoms is fixed in existing DMAs, which fundamentally constrains the achievable performance. Here, we introduce reconfigurable coupling mechanisms between meta-atoms, yielding finer control over the DMA's analog signal processing capabilities. This novel hardware is coined "beyond-diagonal DMA" (BD-DMA), in line with established BD-RIS terminology. We derive a physics-consistent system model revealing (correlated) "beyond-diagonal" programmability in a reduced basis. We also present an equivalent formulation in a non-reduced basis with (uncorrelated) "diagonal" programmability. Based on the diagonal representation, we propose a general and efficient mutual-coupling-aware optimization algorithm. Physics-consistent simulations validate the performance enhancement enabled by reconfigurable coupling mechanisms in BD-DMAs. The BD-DMA benefits grow with the mutual coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Write Cycling Endurance Exceeding 1010 in Sub-50 nm Ferroelectric AlScN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics, particularly aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), have emerged as a promising materials platform for nonvolatile memories, offering high polarization values exceeding 100 uC/cm2. However, their high coercive fields (&gt;3 MV/cm) have limited cycling endurance to ~107 cycles in previous reports. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control of polarization switching in AlScN, achieving write cycling endurance exceeding 1010 cycles a thousand fold improvement over previous wurtzite ferroelectric benchmarks. Through precise voltage modulation in 45 nm thick Al0.64Sc0.36N capacitors, we show that while complete polarization reversal (2Pr ~ 200 uC/cm2) sustains ~108 cycles, partial switching extends endurance beyond 1010 cycles while maintaining a substantial polarization (&gt;30 uC/cm2 for 2Pr). This exceptional endurance, combined with breakdown fields approaching 10 MV/cm in optimized 10 um diameter devices, represents the highest reported values for any wurtzite ferroelectric. Our findings establish a new paradigm for reliability in nitride ferroelectrics, demonstrating that controlled partial polarization and size scaling enables both high endurance and energy efficient operation.</description>

      <title>A generalized equation for the critical current for a one-dimensional crossed-field gap in an orthogonal coordinate system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and point transformations to extend the one-dimensional SCLC from planar gaps to more complicated geometries. However, introducing a magnetic field orthogonal to the diode's electric field complicates these calculations due to changes in the electron trajectory. This paper extends a recent study that applied variational calculus to determine the SCLC for a cylindrical crossed-field diode to derive an equation that is valid for any orthogonal coordinate system. We then derive equations for the SCLC for crossed-field gaps in spherical, tip-to-tip, and tip-to-plane geometries that can be solved numerically. These calculations exhibit a discontinuity at the Hull cutoff magnetic field $B_H$ corresponding to the transition to magnetic insulation as observed analytically for a planar geometry. The ratio of the crossed-field SCLC to the nonmagnetic SCLC becomes essentially independent of geometry when we fix $\delta = D/D_M &gt; 0.6$, where $D$ is the canonical gap distance accounting for geometric effects on electric potential and $D_M$ is the effective gap distance that accounts for magnetic field and geometry. The solutions for these geometries overlap as $\delta \to 1$ since the geometric corrections for electric potential and magnetic field match. This indicates the possibility of more generally accounting for the combination of geometric and magnetic effects when calculating $B_H$ and SCLC.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Higher-Order Exceptional Points via Non-Hermitian Zero-Index Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) in optical structures enable ultra-sensitive responses to perturbations. However, previous investigations on higher-order EPs have predominantly focused on coupled systems, leaving their fundamental physics in open scattering systems largely unexplored. Here, we harness wave interference to realize higher-order EPs in non-Hermitian zero-index materials connected to multiple open channels. Specifically, we show that a three-channel model can give rise to three interesting types of third-order EPs: lasing EP, reflecting EP, and absorbing EP. Notably, near the third-order absorbing EP, we show ultrasensitivity -- a drastic change in output power in response to perturbations at the operating frequency -- in a purely lossy system. These findings pave the way for achieving higher-order and even arbitrary-order EPs in open scattering systems, offering significant potential for advanced sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Energy Bands and Breakdown Characteristics in Al2O3/UWBG AlGaN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (&gt; 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be &gt; 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <title>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</description>

      <title>High Breakdown Electric Field (&gt; 5 MV/cm) in UWBG AlGaN Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the design and demonstration of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN-channel metal-insulator heterostructure field effect transistors (HEFTs) for high-power, high-frequency applications. We find that the integration of gate dielectrics and field plates greatly improves the breakdown field in these devices, with state-of-art average breakdown field of 5.3 MV/cm (breakdown voltage &gt; 260 V) with an associated maximum current density of 342 mA/mm, and cut-off frequency of 9.1 GHz. Furthermore, low trap-related impact was observed from minimal gate and drain lag estimated from pulsed I-V characteristics. The reported results provide the potential of UWBG AlGaN HEFTs for the next generation high-power radio frequency applications.</description>
