      <title>Revisiting Adaptive Cellular Recognition Under Domain Shifts: A Contextual Correspondence View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular nuclei recognition serves as a fundamental and essential step in the workflow of digital pathology. However, with disparate source organs and staining procedures among histology image clusters, the scanned tiles inherently conform to a non-uniform data distribution, which induces deteriorated promises for general cross-cohort usages. Despite the latest efforts leveraging domain adaptation to mitigate distributional discrepancy, those methods are subjected to modeling the morphological characteristics of each cell individually, disregarding the hierarchical latent structure and intrinsic contextual correspondences across the tumor micro-environment. In this work, we identify the importance of implicit correspondences across biological contexts for exploiting domain-invariant pathological composition and thereby propose to exploit the dependence over various biological structures for domain adaptive cellular recognition. We discover those high-level correspondences via unsupervised contextual modeling and use them as bridges to facilitate adaptation over diverse organs and stains. In addition, to further exploit the rich spatial contexts embedded amongst nuclear communities, we propose self-adaptive dynamic distillation to secure instance-aware trade-offs across different model constituents. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on a broad spectrum of cross-domain settings under miscellaneous data distribution shifts and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.</description>

      <title>NeuroSynth: MRI-Derived Neuroanatomical Generative Models and Associated Dataset of 18,000 Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Availability of large and diverse medical datasets is often challenged by privacy and data sharing restrictions. For successful application of machine learning techniques for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and precision medicine, large amounts of data are necessary for model building and optimization. To help overcome such limitations in the context of brain MRI, we present NeuroSynth: a collection of generative models of normative regional volumetric features derived from structural brain imaging. NeuroSynth models are trained on real brain imaging regional volumetric measures from the iSTAGING consortium, which encompasses over 40,000 MRI scans across 13 studies, incorporating covariates such as age, sex, and race. Leveraging NeuroSynth, we produce and offer 18,000 synthetic samples spanning the adult lifespan (ages 22-90 years), alongside the model's capability to generate unlimited data. Experimental results indicate that samples generated from NeuroSynth agree with the distributions obtained from real data. Most importantly, the generated normative data significantly enhance the accuracy of downstream machine learning models on tasks such as disease classification. Data and models are available at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/rongguangw/neuro-synth.</description>

      <title>DREAM: a biomedical data-driven self-evolving autonomous research system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary biomedical research, the efficiency of data-driven approaches is hindered by large data volumes, tool selection complexity, and human resource limitations, necessitating the development of fully autonomous research systems to meet complex analytical needs. Such a system should include the ability to autonomously generate research questions, write analytical code, configure the computational environment, judge and interpret the results, and iteratively generate in-depth questions or solutions, all without human intervention. Here we developed DREAM, the first biomedical Data-dRiven self-Evolving Autonomous systeM, which can independently conduct scientific research without human involvement. Utilizing a clinical dataset and two omics datasets, DREAM demonstrated its ability to raise and deepen scientific questions, with difficulty scores for clinical data questions surpassing top published articles by 5.7% and outperforming GPT-4 and bioinformatics graduate students by 58.6% and 56.0%, respectively. Overall, DREAM has a success rate of 80% in autonomous clinical data mining. Certainly, human can participate in different steps of DREAM to achieve more personalized goals. After evolution, 10% of the questions exceeded the average scores of top published article questions on originality and complexity. In the autonomous environment configuration of the eight bioinformatics workflows, DREAM exhibited an 88% success rate, whereas GPT-4 failed to configure any workflows. In clinical dataset, DREAM was over 10,000 times more efficient than the average scientist with a single computer core, and capable of revealing new discoveries. As a self-evolving autonomous research system, DREAM provides an efficient and reliable solution for future biomedical research. This paradigm may also have a revolutionary impact on other data-driven scientific research fields.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Relations for Active Undulators in Overdamped Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organisms that locomote by propagating waves of body bending can maintain performance across heterogeneous environments by modifying their gait frequency $\omega$ or wavenumber $k$. We identify a unifying relationship between these parameters for overdamped undulatory swimmers (including nematodes, spermatozoa, and mm-scale fish) moving in diverse environmental rheologies, in the form of an active `dispersion relation' $\omega\propto k^{\pm2}$. A model treating the organisms as actively driven viscoelastic beams reproduces the experimentally observed scaling. The relative strength of rate-dependent dissipation in the body and the environment determines whether $k^2$ or $k^{-2}$ scaling is observed. The existence of these scaling regimes reflects the $k$ and $\omega$ dependence of the various underlying force terms and how their relative importance changes with the external environment and the neuronally commanded gait.</description>

      <title>High nucleotide skew palindromic DNA sequences function as replication origins due to their unzipping propensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locations of DNA replication initiation in prokaryotes, called "origins of replication", are well-characterized. However, a mechanistic understanding of the sequence-dependence of the local unzipping of double-stranded DNA, the first step towards replication initiation, is lacking. Here, utilizing a Markov chain model that was created to address the directional nature of DNA unzipping and replication, we model the sequence dependence of local melting of double-stranded linear DNA segments. We show that generalized palindromic sequences with high nucleotide skews have a low kinetic barrier for local melting near melting temperatures. This allows for such sequences to function as replication origins. We support our claim with evidence for high-skew palindromic sequences within the replication origins of mitochondrial DNA, bacteria, archaea and plasmids.</description>

      <title>Understanding Reinforcement Learning-Based Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models: A Tutorial and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial provides a comprehensive survey of methods for fine-tuning diffusion models to optimize downstream reward functions. While diffusion models are widely known to provide excellent generative modeling capability, practical applications in domains such as biology require generating samples that maximize some desired metric (e.g., translation efficiency in RNA, docking score in molecules, stability in protein). In these cases, the diffusion model can be optimized not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly maximize the measure of interest. Such methods are based on concepts from reinforcement learning (RL). We explain the application of various RL algorithms, including PPO, differentiable optimization, reward-weighted MLE, value-weighted sampling, and path consistency learning, tailored specifically for fine-tuning diffusion models. We aim to explore fundamental aspects such as the strengths and limitations of different RL-based fine-tuning algorithms across various scenarios, the benefits of RL-based fine-tuning compared to non-RL-based approaches, and the formal objectives of RL-based fine-tuning (target distributions). Additionally, we aim to examine their connections with related topics such as classifier guidance, Gflownets, flow-based diffusion models, path integral control theory, and sampling from unnormalized distributions such as MCMC.

      <title>Infinitesimal Homeostasis in Mass-Action Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homeostasis occurs in a biological system when a chosen output variable remains approximately constant despite changes in an input variable. In this work we specifically focus on biological systems which may be represented as chemical reaction networks and consider their infinitesimal homeostasis, where the derivative of the input-output function is zero. The specific challenge of chemical reaction networks is that they often obey various conservation laws complicating the standard input-output analysis. We derive several results that allow to verify the existence of infinitesimal homeostasis points both in the absence of conservation and under conservation laws where conserved quantities serve as input parameters. In particular, we introduce the notion of infinitesimal concentration robustness, where the output variable remains nearly constant despite fluctuations in the conserved quantities. We provide several examples of chemical networks which illustrate our results both in deterministic and stochastic settings.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Genomics with Reinforcement Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including decision-making and genomics. The exponential growth of raw genomic data over the past two decades has exceeded the capacity of manual analysis, leading to a growing interest in automatic data analysis and processing. RL algorithms are capable of learning from experience with minimal human supervision, making them well-suited for genomic data analysis and interpretation. One of the key benefits of using RL is the reduced cost associated with collecting labeled training data, which is required for supervised learning. While there have been numerous studies examining the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in genomics, this survey focuses exclusively on the use of RL in various genomics research fields, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), genome assembly, and sequence alignment. We present a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on the application of RL in genomics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. We then discuss potential research directions that are worthy of future exploration, including the development of more sophisticated reward functions as RL heavily depends on the accuracy of the reward function, the integration of RL with other machine learning techniques, and the application of RL to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we present our findings and conclude by summarizing the current state of the field and the future outlook for RL in genomics.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of human sex differences in ECG identified by automated torso-cardiac three-dimensional reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and Aims: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely used for diagnosis and risk stratification following myocardial infarction (MI), though its interpretation is confounded by anatomical variability and sex differences. Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and poorer outcomes following infarction. Sex differences in ECG biomarkers and torso-ventricular anatomy have not been well characterised, largely due to the absence of high-throughput torso reconstruction methods.
  Methods: This work presents quantification of sex differences in ECG versus anatomical biomarkers in healthy and post-MI subjects, enabled by a novel, end-to-end automated pipeline for torso-ventricular anatomical reconstruction from clinically standard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Personalised 3D torso-ventricular reconstructions were generated for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from the UK Biobank. Regression models were created relating the extracted torso-ventricular and ECG parameters.
  Results: Half the sex difference in QRS durations is explained by smaller ventricles in women both in healthy ($3.4 \pm 1.3$ms of $6.0 \pm 1.5$ms) and post-MI ($4.5 \pm 1.4$ms of $8.3 \pm 2.5$ms) subjects. Lower baseline STj amplitude in women is also associated with smaller ventricles, and more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI T wave amplitude and R axis deviations are more strongly associated with a more posterior and horizontal cardiac position in women rather than electrophysiology as in men.
  Conclusion: A novel computational pipeline enables the three-dimensional reconstruction of 1476 torso-cardiac geometries of healthy and post-myocardial infarction subjects, quantification of sex and BMI-related differences and association with ECG biomarkers. Any ECG-based tool should be reviewed considering anatomical sex differences to avoid sex-biased outcomes.</description>

      <title>Feedback Efficient Online Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at modeling complex data distributions, including those of images, proteins, and small molecules. However, in many cases, our goal is to model parts of the distribution that maximize certain properties: for example, we may want to generate images with high aesthetic quality, or molecules with high bioactivity. It is natural to frame this as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, in which the objective is to fine-tune a diffusion model to maximize a reward function that corresponds to some property. Even with access to online queries of the ground-truth reward function, efficiently discovering high-reward samples can be challenging: they might have a low probability in the initial distribution, and there might be many infeasible samples that do not even have a well-defined reward (e.g., unnatural images or physically impossible molecules). In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning procedure that efficiently explores on the manifold of feasible samples. We present a theoretical analysis providing a regret guarantee, as well as empirical validation across three domains: images, biological sequences, and molecules.</description>

      <title>Injecting Hierarchical Biological Priors into Graph Neural Networks for Flow Cytometry Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the complex landscape of hematologic samples such as peripheral blood or bone marrow derived from flow cytometry (FC) data, cell-level prediction presents profound challenges. This work explores injecting hierarchical prior knowledge into graph neural networks (GNNs) for single-cell multi-class classification of tabular cellular data. By representing the data as graphs and encoding hierarchical relationships between classes, we propose our hierarchical plug-in method to be applied to several GNN models, namely, FCHC-GNN, and effectively designed to capture neighborhood information crucial for single-cell FC domain. Extensive experiments on our cohort of 19 distinct patients, demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical biological constraints boosts performance significantly across multiple metrics compared to baseline GNNs without such priors. The proposed approach highlights the importance of structured inductive biases for gaining improved generalization in complex biological prediction tasks.</description>
