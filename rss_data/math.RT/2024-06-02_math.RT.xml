      <title>$G$-tables and the Poisson structure of the even cohomology of cotangent bundle of the Heisenberg Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we define the concept of a $G$-table of a $G$-(co)algebra and we compute the $G$-table of some $G$-(co)algebras (here a $G$-algebra is an algebra on which $G$ acts, semisimply, by algebra automorphisms). The $G$-table of a $G$-(co)algebra $A$ is a set of scalars that provides very precise and concise information about both the algebra structure and the $G$-module structure of $A$. In particular, the ordinary multiplication table of $A$ can be derived from the $G$-table of $A$. From the $G$-table of a $G$-algebra $A$ we define a plain algebra $P(A)$ associated to it and we present some basic functoriality results about $P$. Obtaining the $G$-table of a given $G$-algebra $A$ requires a considerable amount of work but, the result, is a very powerful tool as shown in the second part of the paper. Here we compute the $SL(2)$-tables of the Poisson algebra structure of the even-degree part of the cohomology associated to the cotangent bundle of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie group with Lie algebra $h$, that is $H_E(h)=H_E^{\bullet}(h,\bigwedge^{\bullet}h)$. This Poisson $SL(2)$-algebra has dimension 18. From these $SL(2)$-tables we deduce that the underlying Lie algebra of $H_E(h)$ is isomorphic to $gl(3)\ltimes gl(3)_{ab}$ with the first factor acting on the second (abelian) one by the adjoint representation. We find it remarkable that the Lie algebra structure on $H_{E}(h)$ contains a semisimple Lie subalgebra (in this case $sl(3)$) strictly larger than the Levi factor of $\text{Der}(h)$, which in this case is $sl(2)\subset H^{1}(h,h)$. This means that the Levi factor of the Lie algebra $H_{E}(h)$ has nontrivial elements outside $H^{1}(h,h)$. Finally, this leads us to find a family of commutative Poisson algebras whose underlying Lie structure is $gl(n)\ltimes gl(n)_{ab}$ (arbitrary $n$) such that, for $n=3$, is isomorphic to $H_E(h)$.</description>

      <title>Dimension formulas for period spaces via motives and species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the structure theory of finite dimensional algebras in order to deduce dimension formulas for spaces of period numbers, i.e., complex numbers defined by integrals of algebraic nature. We get a complete and conceptually clear answer in the case of $1$-periods, generalising classical results like Baker's theorem on the logarithms of algebraic numbers and partial results in Huber--W{\"u}stholz \cite{huber-wuestholz}.
  The application to the case of Mixed Tate Motives (i.e., Multiple Zeta Values) recovers the dimension estimates of Deligne--Goncharov \cite{deligne-goncharov}.</description>

      <title>UMP algebras: Consequences and (non-)examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we apply the tools developed in [4] in order to present some consequences of the study of UMP algebras and the ramifications graph of a monomial bound quiver algebra. In particular, we prove that every weakly connected component of the ramifications graph of a UMP monomial algebra is unilaterally connected. Furthermore, we use this characterization to show that, in the case of quadratic monomial algebras, the class of UMP algebras coincides with the class of special multiserial algebras.</description>

      <title>Serre's theorem for coherent sheaves via Auslander's techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an abelian category and a distinguished object with a graded endomorphism ring a necessary and sufficient criterion is given so that the category is equivalent to the abelian quotient of the category of finitely presented graded modules modulo the Serre subcategory of finite length modules. A particular example is the category of coherent sheaves on a projective variety, following a theorem of Serre from 1955. The proof uses Auslander's theory of coherent functors, and there are no noetherianess assumptions. A theorem of Lenzing for representations of hereditary algebras is given as an application.</description>
