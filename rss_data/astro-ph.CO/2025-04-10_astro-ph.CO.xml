      <title>Constraining Mixed Dark Matter models with high redshift Lyman-alpha forest data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study sets new constraints on Cold+Warm Dark Matter (CWDM) models by leveraging the small-scale suppression of structure formation imprinted in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Using the Sherwood-Relics suite, we extract high-fidelity flux power spectra from simulated Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, spanning a broad range of cosmologies and thermal histories. This enables precise constraints on the warm dark matter (WDM) fraction, $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$, and the mass of the WDM particle, $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$. A key advancement of our analysis is the integration of a neural network emulator directly at the likelihood level, significantly accelerating Bayesian parameter inference. With new observations of high-redshift ($z$ = 4.2$-$5.0) quasar spectra from UVES and HIRES, we establish stringent upper limits: for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 1 keV, we find $f_{\mathrm{WDM}} &lt; 0.16$ (2$\sigma$), with constraints loosening to 35\%, 50\%, and 67\% for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 2, 3, and 4 keV, respectively. Our results for pure WDM reaffirm the lower bounds of previous work. Crucially, we account for the fixed resolution of simulations and the impact of patchy reionization, demonstrating their minimal influence on mixed dark matter constraints. This robustness paves the way for tighter bounds with improved statistical samples in the future. Our findings suggest that CWDM models can naturally accommodate mild suppression of matter clustering in the high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power, potentially offering a resolution to some of the ongoing cosmological tensions at low redshifts, namely the $S_{8}$ tension.</description>

      <title>Universal profile for cosmic birefringence tomography with radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to tomographically probe cosmic birefringence using radio galaxies. We show that the redshift evolution of the cosmic birefringence angle induced by a slow-rolling pseudoscalar field, which is a candidate for dynamical dark energy, is independent of the detailed model of the pseudoscalor field. This universal profile evolves predominantly at $z\lesssim10$. In contrast, if the origin is a dark matter-like pseudscalor field, the resulting birefringence angle tends to be negligible in the low-redshift regime. This new insight provides a strong motivation to independently test the cosmic birefringence using polarized astrophysical sources such as radio galaxies. We find that a sample size of $\order{10^5-10^6}$ is required to distinguish the profiles, which is achievable with ongoing and upcoming radio surveys such as ASKAP or SKA.</description>

      <title>Measuring and predicting galaxy assembly bias across galaxy samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important effects shaping small-scale galaxy clustering is galaxy assembly bias, which refers to the dependence of galaxy clustering on halo properties. We investigate this effect using galaxy samples selected according to stellar mass, r-band magnitude, and broad-band colors from the largest hydrodynamical simulation of the IllustrisTNG suite. We find that galaxy assembly bias depends strongly upon the selection criteria, number density, and redshift of the sample, increasing or decreasing the clustering by as much as 25%. Interestingly, no single secondary halo property fully captures the strength of this effect for any galaxy population. Therefore, empirical approaches modeling galaxy assembly bias as a function of a single halo property cannot reproduce predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. We then study how galaxy assembly bias emerges from the interplay of halo assembly bias -- the dependence of halo clustering on properties other than mass -- and occupancy variation -- the correlation between galaxy occupation and secondary halo properties -- and provide an analytical expression that predicts the amount of galaxy assembly bias caused by any halo property. This expression facilitates understanding the dependence of galaxy assembly bias on halo properties and enables the straightforward incorporation of this effect into halo model approaches.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity realizations of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the realization of quintom scenario for dynamical dark energy within modified gravity theories that can efficiently fit the recent observational datasets. Starting from a general effective field theory formulation of dark energy in metric-affine geometry, we derive the background action in unitary gauge and we demonstrate how both $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravity can naturally realize quintom behavior through appropriate forms and parameter choices. Additionally, using the Gaussian process reconstruction of the latest DESI DR2 BAO data combined with SNe and CMB observations, we extract the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, showing that it exhibits quintom-type evolution, crossing the phantom divide from below. Moreover, through detailed parameter estimations and application of information criteria, we compare the model with the quadratic one. Our results show that, due to its rich structure, modified gravity stands as one of the main candidates for the realization of the data-favoured dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension and small-scale inhomogeneities on light propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06831v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the observational challenges in the standard cosmological model is known as the Hubble tension. This $\sim$ 5$\sigma$ discrepancy between early and late measurements of the Hubble Constant arises from observations that rely on cosmological distance estimates, either explicitly or implicitly. In this study, we relax the assumption of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) distance-redshift relation and explore the influence of small-scale inhomogeneities on the propagation of light from distant sources, using the Zeldovich-Kantowski-Dyer-Roeder (ZKDR) approximation as an alternative approach to address this tension. We employ the ZKDR equation along with a modified version to test our hypothesis using recent Type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ compilation and the SH0ES collaboration and six gravitational lens systems from the H0LiCOW collaboration. Our findings indicate that a background model characterized by the ZKDR approximation and its modifications does not solve or alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Probability density function for dispersion measure of fast radio burst from extragalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes in cosmology. An optimized method for extracting the cosmic baryon density from localized FRBs, based on maximizing the joint likelihood function of the extragalactic dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$), was proposed by Macquart et al. [Nature 581, 391 (2020)]. In this Letter, we identify a crucial term that was omitted in their derivation of the probability density function (PDF) for $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$. Using simulated FRB data, we demonstrate that neglecting this term leads to a systematic bias in the inferred cosmic baryon density, with deviations exceeding the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This highlights the importance of the missing term for the reliable cosmological application of FRBs. Furthermore, employing a sample of 88 real localized FRBs, we find that the baryon density derived using the original PDF by Macquart et al. is inconsistent with the Planck 2018 CMB data, while our corrected PDF yields a result in excellent agreement. We conclude that the omitted term is essential and must be included in order to obtain accurate cosmological constraints from FRB observations.</description>

      <title>Correcting for interloper contamination in the power spectrum with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern slitless spectroscopic surveys, such as Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope, collect vast numbers of galaxy spectra but suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios. This often leads to incorrect redshift assignments when relying on a single emission line, due to noise spikes or contamination from non-target emission lines, commonly referred to as redshift interlopers. We propose a machine learning approach to correct the impact of interlopers at the level of measured summary statistics, focusing on the power spectrum monopole and line interlopers as a proof of concept. To model interloper effects, we use halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations as proxies for galaxies, displacing a fraction of halos by the distance corresponding to the redshift offset between target and interloper galaxies. This yields contaminated catalogs with varying interloper fractions across a wide range of cosmologies from the Quijote suite. We train a neural network on the power spectrum monopole, alone or combined with the bispectrum monopole, from contaminated mocks to estimate the interloper fraction and reconstruct the cleaned power spectrum. We evaluate performance in two settings: one with fixed cosmology and another where cosmological parameters vary under broad priors. In the fixed case, the network recovers the interloper fraction and corrects the power spectrum to better than 1% accuracy. When cosmology varies, performance degrades, but adding bispectrum information significantly improves results, reducing the interloper fraction error by 40-60%. We also study the method's performance as a function of the size of the training set and find that optimal strategies depend on the correlation between target and interloper samples: bispectrum information aids performance when target and interloper galaxies are uncorrelated, while tighter priors are more effective when the two are strongly correlated.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $z \sim 1$ IMF with {\it HST} and {\it JWST} lensed stars in MACS J0416.1-2403</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of galaxy properties and evolution is contingent on knowing the initial mass function (IMF), and yet to date, the IMF is constrained only to local galaxies. Individual stars are now becoming routinely detected at cosmological distances, where luminous stars such as supergiants in background galaxies critically lensed by galaxy clusters are temporarily further magnified by huge factors up to $10^{4}$ by intra-cluster stars, thus being detected as transients. The detection rate of these events depends on the abundance of luminous stars in the background galaxy and is thus sensitive to the IMF and the star formation history (SFH), especially for the blue supergiants detected as transients in the rest-frame UV/optical filters. As a proof of concept, we use simple SFH and IMF models constrained by spectral energy distribution (SED) to see how well we can predict the {\it HST} and {\it JWST} transient detection rate in a lensed arc dubbed ``Spock'' ($z = 1.0054$). We find that demanding a simultaneously fit of SED and rest-frame UV/optical transient detection rate places constraints on the IMF, independent of the assumed simple SFH model. We conclude our Bayesian likelihood analysis indicates that the data definitively prefer the ``Spock'' galaxy to have a Salpeter IMF ($\alpha = 2.35$) rather than a Top-heavy IMF ($\alpha = 1$) -- what is thought to be the case in the early universe -- given our methodology and assumptions with no clear excess of supergiants above the standard IMF.</description>

      <title>Microlensing at Cosmological Distances: Event Rate Predictions in the Warhol Arc of MACS 0416</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly magnified stars ($\mu$ $&gt;$ 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at $z=0.94$) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at $z=0.396)$ where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity of Tensor Induced Density Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussianity of second-order matter density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (GWs). These tensor-induced scalar modes arise from local fluctuations in the GWs energy density, which is quadratic in tensor perturbations. The resulting second-order density contrast follows a chi-squared distribution, naturally exhibiting significant non-Gaussianity. We compute the bispectrum of these tensor-induced scalar modes and analyze its dependence on various primordial GWs power spectra, including scale-invariant, blue-tilted, Gaussian-bump, and monochromatic sources. We find that the bispectrum shape is inherently sensitive to the underlying GWs spectrum by construction. In particular, Gaussian-bump and monochromatic sources produce a strong signal peaking in the equilateral configuration, similar to the effect of scalar-induced tensor modes. Our findings reveal a new way to probe primordial GWs via galaxy surveys and highlight a unique feature of tensor-induced density perturbations, otherwise mimicking linear ones on sub-horizon scales.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable, End-to-End Forward Model for 21 cm Cosmology: Estimating the Foreground, Instrument, and Signal Joint Posterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a differentiable, end-to-end Bayesian forward modeling framework for line intensity mapping cosmology experiments, with a specific focus on low-frequency radio telescopes targeting the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen as a cosmological probe. Our framework is capable of posterior density estimation of the cosmological signal jointly with foreground and telescope parameters at the field level. Our key aim is to be able to optimize the model's high-dimensional, non-linear, and ill-conditioned parameter space, while also sampling from it to perform robust uncertainty quantification within a Bayesian framework. We show how a differentiable programming paradigm, accelerated by recent advances in machine learning software and hardware, can make this computationally-demanding, end-to-end Bayesian approach feasible. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept on a simplified signal recovery problem for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment, highlighting the framework's ability to build confidence in early 21 cm signal detections even in the presence of poorly understood foregrounds and instrumental systematics. We use a Hessian-preconditioned Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample our parameter space with a dimensionality approaching $N\sim10^5$, which enables joint, end-to-end nuisance parameter marginalization over foreground and instrumental terms. Lastly, we introduce a new spherical harmonic formalism that is a complete and orthogonal basis on the cut sky relevant to drift-scan radio surveys, which we call the spherical stripe harmonic formalism, and it's associated three-dimensional basis, the spherical stripe Fourier-Bessel formalism.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Reconstruction of Large-Scale Structure from Combined Photometric and Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy surveys are crucial for studying large-scale structure (LSS) and cosmology, yet they face limitations--imaging surveys provide extensive sky coverage but suffer from photo-$z$ uncertainties, while spectroscopic surveys yield precise redshifts but are sample-limited. To take advantage of both photo-$z$ and spec-$z$ data while eliminating photo-$z$ errors, we propose a deep learning framework based on a dual UNet architecture that integrates these two datasets at the field level to reconstruct the 3D photo-$z$ density field. We train the network on mock samples representative of stage-IV spectroscopic surveys, utilizing CosmicGrowth simulations with a $z=0.59$ snapshot containing $2048^3$ particles in a $(1200~h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume. Several metrics, including correlation coefficient, MAE, MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, validate the model's accuracy. Moreover, the reconstructed power spectrum closely matches the ground truth at small scales ($k \gtrsim 0.06~h/\rm Mpc$) within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the UNet model significantly improves the estimation of photo-$z$ power spectrum multipoles. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to enhance LSS reconstruction by using both spectroscopic and photometric data.</description>

      <title>Graviton stimulated emission in squeezed vacuum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state in a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation and average it over general quantum states. In contrast to the usual Boltzmann-based descriptions, our approach captures the subtleties arising from quantum coherence in different number eigenstates, which is essential for soft graviton modes in the squeezed vacuum state. Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect. We examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem.</description>

      <title>Hunting axion dark matter signatures in low-frequency terrestrial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Earth's natural environment can serve as a powerful probe for ultralight axion dark matter. In the presence of global geomagnetic fields, the axions with masses ranging from $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}-10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ induce electromagnetic waves in the (sub-) extremely low-frequency band ($0.3-30\,{\rm Hz}$) through the axion-photon coupling. We predict the amplitude of induced magnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, taking the finite conductivity of the atmosphere into account. This allows us to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter, $g_{\rm a\gamma}$, from the long-term monitoring data of the low-frequency magnetic fields, resulting in a significant improvement from the previous constraints down to $g_{\rm a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for axion mass $\sim 3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>FOREVER22: Insights into star formation and clustering properties of protoclusters from simulations and JWST</title>

Abstract: Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer, we investigate star formation and overdensity ($\delta$) in Coma-type cluster progenitors from $z=14$ to 6. Our simulations reproduce observed $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations and $\delta$ at these redshifts. We find: (1) protocluster (PC) and mean-density field (MF) galaxies show similar $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations, with PC galaxies extending to higher $M_{\rm star}$ and SFR. (2) UV-bright PC galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -20$~mag) have $&gt;2$ mag higher UV attenuation and shallower UV slopes than MF galaxies. (3) $\delta$ increases with redshift, depending on observational parameters (e.g., $\delta\sim50$ at $z=14$ to $\delta\sim3$ at $z=6$ for a search volume of $\sim3000$~cMpc$^3$ and a limiting magnitude of $M_{\rm UV}=-17$~mag). These results indicate that enhanced star formation in PCs is driven by massive galaxy overdensity, not anomalously high specific SFR. While simulated $\delta$ agrees with observed PC candidates (potential Coma progenitors), some MF galaxies show comparable $\delta$. We propose a robust PC identification method using both $\delta$ and $M_{\rm star}$ of the most massive member. Critical $M_{\rm star}$ thresholds for Coma progenitors are estimated ($10^{7.1}$ to $10^{10.2}$ M$_\odot$ from $z=14$ to 6). Comparison with JWST observations suggests GS-z14-0 and GS-z14-1, the current highest redshift holders, are likely progenitors of Coma-type clusters.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Component Separation for DESI LAE Automated Spectroscopic Redshifts and Photometric Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are valuable high-redshift cosmological probes traditionally identified using specialized narrow-band photometric surveys. In ground-based spectroscopy, it can be difficult to distinguish the sharp LAE peak from residual sky emission lines using automated methods, leading to misclassified redshifts. We present a Bayesian spectral component separation technique to automatically determine spectroscopic redshifts for LAEs while marginalizing over sky residuals. We use visually inspected spectra of LAEs obtained using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to create a data-driven prior and can determine redshift by jointly inferring sky residual, LAE, and residual components for each individual spectrum. We demonstrate this method on 910 spectroscopically observed $z = 2-4$ DESI LAE candidate spectra and determine their redshifts with $&gt;$90% accuracy when validated against visually inspected redshifts. Using the $\Delta \chi^2$ value from our pipeline as a proxy for detection confidence, we then explore potential survey design choices and implications for targeting LAEs with medium-band photometry. This method allows for scalability and accuracy in determining redshifts from DESI spectra, and the results provide recommendations for LAE targeting in anticipation of future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-alpha and Continuum Origins Survey I: Survey description and Ly$\alpha$ imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms driving the escape of ionizing or Lyman continuum (LyC) emission from the interstellar medium of galaxies is necessary to constrain the evolution of Reionization, and the sources responsible for it. While progress has been made into identifying the global galaxy properties linked to the escape fraction of ionizing radiation, f$_{esc}^{LyC}$, little is currently known about how spatially resolved galaxy properties impact this parameter. We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data obtained as part of the Lyman $\alpha$ and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS). LaCOS consists of HST imaging in 5 filters covering rest-frame optical and UV bands for a subsample of 42 galaxies in the Low redshift Lyman Continuum Survey, 22 being Lyman continuum emitters ($f_{esc}^{LyC}=0.01-0.49$). These data allow for investigations of the connection between sub-kpc stellar and nebular properties, including Ly$\alpha$ emission, and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. Here, we describe the sample selection, observations and data reduction methods. Additionally, we present results on the link between global and resolved Ly$\alpha$ photometry and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. We find similar trends between global photometric observables ($L_{Ly\alpha}$, $EW_{Ly\alpha}$, $f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$, $r_{50}$, $\Sigma_{SFR}$) and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ as previously found with spectroscopy, but the correlations generally show a slightly smaller degree of correlations. However, we do find strong correlations between Ly$\alpha$ observables ($L_{Ly\alpha}$,$EW_{Ly\alpha}$) and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ when measured in a small aperture around the brightest UV source in each galaxy. We interpret these results as evidence that LyC photons escaping on the line-of-sight are contributed by a small number of UV-bright compact regions in most galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological constraints of the weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering joint analysis in the CSST photometric survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the joint weak lensing and galaxy clustering analysis from the photometric survey operated by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), and study the strength of the cosmological constraints. We employ a high-resolution JiuTian-1G simulation to construct a partial-sky light cone to $z=3$ covering 100 deg$^2$, and obtain the CSST galaxy mock samples based on an improved semi-analytical model. We perform a multi-lens-plane algorithm to generate corresponding synthetic weak lensing maps and catalogs. Then we generate the mock data based on these catalogs considering the instrumental and observational effects of the CSST, and use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to perform the constraints. The covariance matrix includes non-Gaussian contributions and super-sample covariance terms, and the systematics from intrinsic alignments, galaxy bias, photometric redshift uncertainties, shear calibration, and non-linear effects are considered in the analysis. We find that the constraint result is comparable to that from Stage III surveys, and it can be significantly improved further in the full CSST survey with 17500 deg$^2$. This indicates the CSST photometric survey is powerful for exploring the Universe.</description>

      <title>FAST drift scan survey for HI intensity mapping: simulation on hunting HI filament with pairwise stacking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filaments stand as pivotal structures within the cosmic web. However, direct detection of the cold gas content of the filaments remains challenging due to its inherent low brightness temperature. With the TNG hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of isolating faint filament HI signal from the FAST HI intensity mapping (IM) survey through pairwise stacking of galaxies, which yields an average HI filament signal amplitude of $\sim 0.29\ {\mu{\rm K}}$ at $z\simeq 0.1$. However, our simulations reveal a non-negligible contribution from HI-rich galaxies within or near the filaments. Particularly, the faint galaxies dominantly contribute to the extra filament HI signal. Our simulation also shows that the measurement uncertainty is produced by both thermal noise and background variation caused by brightness leakage from surrounding random galaxies. Given a fixed total observation time, a wide-field HI IM survey, which includes a large number of galaxy pairs, can simultaneously reduce thermal noise to below the filament signal level and minimize background variation to a negligible level. Through the end-to-end simulation, this work demonstrates the critical role of the galaxy pairwise stacking method in future filament HI detection, outlining a road map for filament HI detection in the next-generation HI IM surveys.</description>

      <title>Lattice simulations of axion-U(1) inflation: gravitational waves, magnetic fields, and scalar statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study axion-U(1) inflation, focusing on the regime where the coupling between axions and gauge fields results in significant backreaction from the amplified gauge fields during inflation. These amplified gauge fields not only generate high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), but also enhance spatial inhomogeneities in the axion field. GWs serve as key probe for constraining the coupling strength between the axion and gauge fields. We find that, when backreaction is important during inflation, the constraints on the coupling strength due to GW overproduction are relaxed compared to previous studies, in which backreaction matters only after inflation. Moreover, our results suggest that the probability density function (PDF) of axion fluctuations tends toward a Gaussian distribution even in cases where gauge field backreaction is important only after inflation. This aligns with previous studies where the same effect was observed for cases with strong backreaction during inflation. This finding can be crucial for future studies of primordial black hole (PBH) formation, which can further constrain the coupling strength. We also calculate the spectrum of the produced magnetic fields in this model and find that their strength is compatible with the observed lower limits.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves from logarithmic non-Gaussianity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black hole (PBH) based on numerical relativity simulations and peak theory as well as the corresponding scalar induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals in the presence of \emph{logarithmic non-Gaussianities} which has recently been confirmed in a wide class of inflation models. Through numerical calculations, we find certain parameter spaces of the critical thresholds for the type A PBH formation and reveal a maximum critical threshold value. We also find that there is a region where no PBH is produced from type II fluctuations contrary to a previous study. We then confirm that SIGW signals originated from the logarithmic non-Gaussianity are detectable in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna if PBHs account for whole dark matter. Finally, we discuss the SIGW interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background reported by the recent pulsar timing array observations. We find that PBH overproduction is a serious problem for most of the parameter space, while this tension might still be alleviated in the non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Bounds on decaying sterile neutrinos via magnetic dipole moment from COB intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent observation by Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) mounted on NASA's New Horizons yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB). The reported COB intensity is $11.16\pm 1.35$ $\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ at a pivot wavelength $ \lambda_{piv} = 0.608 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$ observed in the range $( 0.4 \mu\mathrm{m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.9 \, \mu\mathrm{m} )$. After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble Space Telescope count, diffused galactic light, and scattered light from bright star foregrounds, an anomalous intensity $2.99 \pm 2.03~\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ has been found. We considered radiatively decaying sterile neutrinos of mass scales keV and eV, as dark matter candidate and as dark radiation respectively, that could contribute to this anomalous reported intensity. Using this, we derive upper bounds on sterile-to-sterile and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moments. We find that sterile neutrinos with mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm keV)$ scale take values of the transition magnetic moment in the range $ 3\times 10^{-12}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-9}\,\mu_{B}$, whereas for mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm eV)$ scale the transition magnetic moment in the range $3\times 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-12}\,\mu_{B}$, here $\mu_B$ is Bohr magneton.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Search with a Resonantly-Coupled Hybrid Spin System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in tabletop quantum sensor technology have enabled searches for nongravitational interactions of dark matter (DM). Traditional axion DM experiments rely on sharp resonance, resulting in extensive scanning time to cover a wide mass range. In this work, we present a broadband approach in an alkali-${}^{21}$Ne spin system. We identify two distinct hybrid spin-coupled regimes: a self-compensation (SC) regime at low frequencies and a hybrid spin resonance (HSR) regime at higher frequencies. By utilizing these two distinct regimes, we significantly enhance the bandwidth of ${}^{21}$Ne nuclear spin compared to conventional nuclear magnetic resonance, while maintaining competitive sensitivity. We present a comprehensive broadband search for axion-like dark matter, covering 5 orders of magnitude of Compton frequencies range within $[10^{-2}, \, 10^3]$ Hz. We set new constraints on the axion dark matter interactions with neutrons and protons, accounting for the effects of DM stochasticity. For the axion-neutron coupling, our results reach a low value of $|g_{ann}|\le 3\times 10^{-10}$ in the frequency range $[2\times 10^{-2}, \, 4]$ Hz surpassing astrophysical limits and providing the strongest laboratory constraints in the $[10, \, 100]$ Hz range. For the axion-proton coupling, we offer the best terrestrial constraints for the frequency ranges $[2\times 10^{-2}, \, 5]$Hz and $[16, \, 7\times 10^{2}]$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Evidence for Lensing-Induced Alignments of High-Redshift Galaxies in JWST-CEERS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of low-mass ($\log_{10} M_*/M_{\odot}=9-10$) galaxies at high redshift ($z&gt;1$) appear elongated in projection. We use JWST-CEERS observations to explore the role of gravitational lensing in this puzzle. The typical galaxy-galaxy lensing shear $\gamma\sim1\%$ is too low to explain the predominance of elongated early galaxies with ellipticity $e\approx0.6$. However, non-parametric quantile regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees reveals hints of an excess of tangentially-aligned source-lens pairs with $\gamma&gt;10\%$. On larger scales, we also find evidence for weak lensing shear. We rule out the null hypothesis of randomly oriented galaxies at $\gtrsim99\%$ significance in multiple NIRCam chips, modules and pointings. The number of such regions is small and attributable to chance, but coherent alignment patterns suggest otherwise. On the chip scale, the average complex ellipticity $\langle e\rangle\sim10\%$ is non-negligible and beyond the level of our PSF uncertainties. The shear variance $\langle\overline{\gamma}^2\rangle\sim10^{-3}$ is an order of magnitude above the conventional weak lensing regime but is more sensitive to PSF systematics, intrinsic alignments, cosmic variance and other biases. Taking it as an upper limit, the maximum implied ``cosmic shear'' is only a few percent and cannot explain the elongated shapes of early galaxies. The alignments themselves may arise from lensing by a protocluster or filament at $z\sim0.75$ where we find an overabundance of massive lens galaxies. We recommend a weak lensing search for overdensities in ``blank'' deep fields with JWST and the Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss FLRW-cosmologies with negatively-curved spatial slices that induce a late-time freezing of all the moduli of an effective field theory through Hubble friction, independently of the moduli-space curvature. This holds for pure moduli, which appear ubiquitously in string compactifications. Crucially, the cosmological solutions approach a Milne universe. Hence, the mechanism we describe in fact corresponds to late-time moduli freezing into Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Dark Energy Prior to its Discovery</title>

Abstract: This is a review and statistical analysis of the evidence supporting the existence of a cosmological constant in the early 1990s, before its discovery made with distant supernovae in 1998. The earlier evidence was derived from newly precise measurements of the Universe, including its mass density, the Hubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, the filamentary large-scale structure, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. These measurements created tension for models assuming the cosmological constant was zero. This tension was alleviated by several insightful papers published before 1996, which proposed a cosmological constant that increased the expansion rate. Statistical analysis here shows that the probability of the cosmological constant being zero was demonstrably less than a few percent. Some models identified a best-fit value close to the modern estimate of Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7.</description>

      <title>FAST Drift Scan Survey for HI Intensity Mapping. II. Stacking-based Beam Construction of the 19-feed Array at $1.4$ GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) presents great promise for future cosmological large-scale structure surveys. However, a major challenge for HIIM cosmological studies is to accurately subtract the foreground contamination. An accurate beam model is crucial for improving the quality of foreground subtraction. In this work, we develop a stacking-based beam reconstruction method utilizing the radio continuum point sources within the drift-scan field. Based on the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we employ two sets of drift-scan survey data and merge the measurements to construct the beam patterns of the 19 FAST L-band feeds. To model the beams, we utilize the Zernike polynomial (ZP), which effectively captures asymmetric features of the main beam and the different side lobes. Due to the symmetric location of the beams, the main features of the beams are closely related to the distance from the center of the feed array, e.g., as the distance increases, side lobes become more pronounced. This modeling pipeline leverages the stable drift-scan data to extract beam patterns while accounting for and excluding the reflector's changing effects. It provides a more accurate measurement beam and a more precise model beam for FAST HIIM cosmology surveys.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial velocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were established by Karachentsev and Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background cosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the total radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies having small angular separations $\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to ca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and tangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more than 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\theta &lt; 10$ deg, the infall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we found the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However, the infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial velocity dispersion. Observed under $\theta &lt; 10$ deg the velocity dispersion inferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even coincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups and clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity dispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,min}} = (193 \pm 42)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$, from the major infall model (lower bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,maj}} = (129 \pm 64) ~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{r,\Delta v} = (102 \pm 36)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.</description>

      <title>$\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and describe $\tt GrayHawk$, a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray-body factors for massless fields with spin \(s = 0, 1/2, 1, 2\) in modes specified by the angular quantum number \(l\), given a black hole metric and the associated parameter values. $\tt GrayHawk$ is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. Additionally, its modular structure allows users to extend its functionality easily by incorporating alternative metrics or configurations. This versatility makes $\tt GrayHawk$ a powerful and adaptable resource for researchers studying black hole physics and Hawking radiation. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.</description>

      <title>Measuring Type Ia Supernova Angular-Diameter Distances with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of intensity interferometry, based on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, for measuring supernova sizes and distances. Through optimized telescope positioning, observing strategy, and advancements in single-photon detection technology, this method can provide precise angular size measurements of Type Ia supernovae as bright as 12~mag, corresponding to a local volume out to $z\sim0.004$, with an anticipated rate of $\sim 1$ events per year. The combination of angular size data with known physical dimensions enables accurate distance determination. Multiple telescope pairs at different relative positions allow tomographic mapping of the ejecta structure while reducing distance uncertainties. As Type Ia supernovae serve as standardizable candles for measuring the Universe's expansion history, combining intensity interferometry distances with the supernova Hubble diagram facilitates measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between soft X-rays and galaxies A new benchmark for galaxy evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents the construction and validation of complete stellar mass-selected, volume-limited galaxy samples using the Legacy Survey (data release 10) galaxy catalogs, covering $\sim16,800$ deg$^2$ of extra-galactic sky, and extending to redshift $z&lt;0.35$. We measure the correlation function of these galaxies with tiny statistical uncertainties at the percent level and systematic uncertainties up to 5\%. A 4-parameter halo occupation distribution (HOD) model is fitted to retrieve the population of host halos, yielding results on the stellar to halo mass relation consistent with the current models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using these complete galaxy samples, we measure and analyze the cross-correlation (X-corr) between galaxies and all soft X-ray photons observed by SRG/eROSITA in the 0.5-2 keV band over $\sim13,000$ deg$^2$. The cross correlation measurements have unprecedented sub-percent statistical uncertainty and ~5-10\% systematic uncertainty.
  An extension to the halo model is introduced to interpret the X-corr, decomposing contributions from X-ray point sources, hot gas (CGM), satellites, and the 2-halo term. For low stellar mass thresholds ($\log M^*/M_{\odot}&gt;$ 10, 10.25, 10.5), we find that the point source emission dominates the X-corr at small separation ($r&lt;80$kpc). Then, in the range ($80&lt;r&lt;2$Mpc), the emission from large halos hosting satellite galaxies dominates. Finally, on scales beyond that considered here ($r&gt;2$Mpc), the 2-halo term becomes dominant. Interestingly, there is no scale at which the CGM dominates. In the range ($20&lt;r&lt;200$kpc), the CGM contributes to more than 10\% of the signal. Progressively, with the minimum stellar mass increasing, the CGM emission increases. We constrain the $M_{500c}-L_X$ scaling relation slope, $1.629^{+0.091}_{-0.089}$, at the 5\% level using the samples with the lowest mass threshold.</description>
