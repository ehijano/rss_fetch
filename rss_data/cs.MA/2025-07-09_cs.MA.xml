      <title>Inaugural MOASEI Competition at AAMAS'2025: A Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Methods for Open Agent Systems Evaluation Initiative (MOASEI) Competition, a multi-agent AI benchmarking event designed to evaluate decision-making under open-world conditions. Built on the free-range-zoo environment suite, MOASEI introduced dynamic, partially observable domains with agent and task openness--settings where entities may appear, disappear, or change behavior over time. The 2025 competition featured three tracks--Wildfire, Rideshare, and Cybersecurity--each highlighting distinct dimensions of openness and coordination complexity. Eleven teams from international institutions participated, with four of those teams submitting diverse solutions including graph neural networks, convolutional architectures, predictive modeling, and large language model--driven meta--optimization. Evaluation metrics centered on expected utility, robustness to perturbations, and responsiveness to environmental change. The results reveal promising strategies for generalization and adaptation in open environments, offering both empirical insight and infrastructure for future research. This report details the competition's design, findings, and contributions to the open-agent systems research community.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Agent-Based Modelling: Current and possible uses across the modelling cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with increasingly sophisticated natural language understanding and generative capabilities has sparked interest in the Agent-based Modelling (ABM) community. With their ability to summarize, generate, analyze, categorize, transcribe and translate text, answer questions, propose explanations, sustain dialogue, extract information from unstructured text, and perform logical reasoning and problem-solving tasks, LLMs have a good potential to contribute to the modelling process. After reviewing the current use of LLMs in ABM, this study reflects on the opportunities and challenges of the potential use of LLMs in ABM. It does so by following the modelling cycle, from problem formulation to documentation and communication of model results, and holding a critical stance.</description>

      <title>From General Relation Patterns to Task-Specific Decision-Making in Continual Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Co-MARL) requires agents to address catastrophic forgetting issues while learning new coordination policies with the dynamics team. In this paper, we delve into the core of Co-MARL, namely Relation Patterns, which refer to agents' general understanding of interactions. In addition to generality, relation patterns exhibit task-specificity when mapped to different action spaces. To this end, we propose a novel method called General Relation Patterns-Guided Task-Specific Decision-Maker (RPG). In RPG, agents extract relation patterns from dynamic observation spaces using a relation capturer. These task-agnostic relation patterns are then mapped to different action spaces via a task-specific decision-maker generated by a conditional hypernetwork. To combat forgetting, we further introduce regularization items on both the relation capturer and the conditional hypernetwork. Results on SMAC and LBF demonstrate that RPG effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy Supervisor Agent Design for Clinical Reasoning Assistance in a Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assisting medical students with clinical reasoning (CR) during clinical scenario training remains a persistent challenge in medical education. This paper presents the design and architecture of the Fuzzy Supervisor Agent (FSA), a novel component for the Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation (MAECSS) platform. The FSA leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to continuously interpret student interactions with specialized clinical agents (e.g., patient, physical exam, diagnostic, intervention) using pre-defined fuzzy rule bases for professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and contextual distraction. By analyzing student decision-making processes in real-time, the FSA is designed to deliver adaptive, context-aware feedback and provides assistance precisely when students encounter difficulties. This work focuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its potential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in simulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical evaluation and integration into broader educational settings. More detailed design and implementation is~\href{https://github.com/2sigmaEdTech/MAS/}{open sourced here}.</description>

      <title>A LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems for Professional Development of Mathematics Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Professional development (PD) serves as the cornerstone for teacher tutors to grasp content knowledge. However, providing equitable and timely PD opportunities for teachers poses significant challenges. To address this issue, we introduce I-VIP (Intelligent Virtual Interactive Program), an intelligent tutoring platform for teacher professional development, driven by large language models (LLMs) and supported by multi-agent frameworks. This platform offers a user-friendly conversational interface and allows users to employ a variety of interactive tools to facilitate question answering, knowledge comprehension, and reflective summarization while engaging in dialogue. To underpin the functionality of this platform, including knowledge expectation analysis, response scoring and classification, and feedback generation, the multi-agent frameworks are leveraged to enhance the accuracy of judgments and mitigate the issue of missing key points.</description>

      <title>Constella: Supporting Storywriters' Interconnected Character Creation through LLM-based Multi-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating a cast of characters by attending to their relational dynamics is a critical aspect of most long-form storywriting. However, our formative study (N=14) reveals that writers struggle to envision new characters that could influence existing ones, to balance similarities and differences among characters, and to intricately flesh out their relationships. Based on these observations, we designed Constella, an LLM-based multi-agent tool that supports storywriters' interconnected character creation process. Constella suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature). Our 7-8 day deployment study with storywriters (N=11) shows that Constella enabled the creation of expansive communities composed of related characters, facilitated the comparison of characters' thoughts and emotions, and deepened writers' understanding of character relationships. We conclude by discussing how multi-agent interactions can help distribute writers' attention and effort across the character cast.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Model-Based Multi-Robot Planning for Time-Critical Search and Inspection Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disaster response or surveillance operations, quickly identifying areas needing urgent attention is critical, but deploying response teams to every location is inefficient or often impossible. Effective performance in this domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by 16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world platforms using quad-copters.</description>

      <title>An AI Theory of Mind Will Enhance Our Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective intelligence plays a central role in many fields, from economics and evolutionary theory to neural networks and eusocial insects, and is also core to work on emergence and self-organisation in complex-systems theory. However, in human collective intelligence there is still much to understand about how specific psychological processes at the individual level give rise to self-organised structures at the social level. Psychological factors have so far played a minor role in collective-intelligence studies because the principles are often general and applicable to agents without sophisticated psychologies. We emphasise, with examples from other complex adaptive systems, the broad applicability of collective-intelligence principles, while noting that mechanisms and time scales differ markedly between cases. We review evidence that flexible collective intelligence in human social settings is improved by a particular cognitive tool: our Theory of Mind. We then hypothesise that AIs equipped with a theory of mind will enhance collective intelligence in ways similar to human contributions. To make this case, we step back from the algorithmic basis of AI psychology and consider the large-scale impact AI can have as agential actors in a 'social ecology' rather than as mere technological tools. We identify several key characteristics of psychologically mediated collective intelligence and show that the development of a Theory of Mind is crucial in distinguishing human social collective intelligence from more general forms. Finally, we illustrate how individuals, human or otherwise, integrate within a collective not by being genetically or algorithmically programmed, but by growing and adapting into the socio-cognitive niche they occupy. AI can likewise inhabit one or multiple such niches, facilitated by a Theory of Mind.</description>

      <title>Origin-Destination Pattern Effects on Large-Scale Mixed Traffic Control via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a major challenge for modern urban transportation, diminishing both efficiency and quality of life. While autonomous driving technologies and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise for improving traffic control, most prior work has focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections. Large-scale mixed traffic control, involving both human-driven and robotic vehicles, remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for managing large-scale mixed traffic networks, where intersections are controlled either by traditional traffic signals or by robotic vehicles. We evaluate our approach on a real-world network of 14 intersections in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA, using average vehicle waiting time as the primary measure of traffic efficiency. We are exploring a problem that has not been sufficiently addressed: Is large-scale Multi-Agent Traffic Control (MTC) still feasible when facing time-varying Origin-Destination (OD) patterns?</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with $\omega$-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an $\omega$-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of B\"uchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00631v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers, challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>MOD-X: A Modular Open Decentralized eXchange Framework proposal for Heterogeneous Interoperable Artificial Intelligence Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols. Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents (agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central coordination.</description>
