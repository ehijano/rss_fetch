      <title>Crossover between the zeptosecond and attosecond physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear orbiting resonances have been revealed at the sub-barrier energies as an atomic phenomenon by means of x-ray spectroscopy experiments. This interpretation is supported by several phenomenological models and theoretical estimates of the nuclear orbiting timescale and cross-section, inelastic scattering cross section including both nuclear and Coulomb excitation, and the Wigner-Smith time delay. We demonstrate that a multi-photon exchange during nuclear orbiting is responsible for an atomic excitation. Furthermore, proximity of the projectile and target nucleus during the nuclear orbiting modifies the effective charge of the projectile. Even though this orbiting induced excitation is triggered in zeptoseconds, it can still be observed in the attosecond time scale because of the Wigner-Smith time delay inherent to autoionization. Thus, we demonstrate the crossover between the zeptosecond and attosecond time scales which are native to nuclear and atomic physics, respectively. Markedly, this crossover may be the reason for x-ray production from ultra short nuclear processes ($\leq 10^{-21}$ sec). This explanation is likely to resolve the fission time scale anomaly and can stimulate cross-disciplinary research ranging from solid state to high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Microwave Phase Mapping and Angle-of-Arrival Detection Using Rydberg Atom-Based Electrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for simultaneously measuring the phase fronts of three or more RF fields using thermal Rydberg atoms. We demonstrate this method using an all-dielectric atomic electrometer acting in a heterodyne configuration to detect three single tone continuous-wave microwave signals propagating in free space. We show that this method can be used to measure the angle of arrival of each source. This method requires no calibration of the incident fields and makes no assumption about the form of the incident phase fronts. Because the sensor is minimally perturbing, it provides a direct probe of signal phase even in complicated environments, such as the near field of an antenna source or scattering surface. The measurements presented here are performed using a single scanned sensor, but this technique can trivially be extended to an array of sensors which would enable phase sensitive imaging and related applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of the delocalized charge distribution in trapped ion-atom collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of ion-atom interactions, the ion often remain trapped during the experiments. However, the effects of the trapping potential of the ion on ion-neutral interactions remain largely unexplored. Although trap-assisted ion-neutral complex formation has been experimentally studied and described by applying semiclassical theories where the ion is treated as a point charge particle, the potential effect of a delocalized charge distribution of a confined ion due to its quantum mechanical wavefunction has not been considered. To remedy this, in the present theoretical work we substitute the point charge of the ion with a delocalized charged distribution according to its motional ground state in the trap. Our results show that the trapping frequency and hence the spatial extension of the ion's ground-state wavefunction drastically affects the elastic and transport cross sections in interactions with neutral atoms. Stimulated by these results, we propose experimental procedures to verify the effects of the delocalize charge distribution in ion-atom interactions via measuring the heating rate of the ion due to the energy transfer in atomic collisions. Our novel approach brings new possibilities for investigating ion-neutral systems and, through them, new perspectives on ionic polarons and potentially a better understanding of trap-induced losses in ion-neutral experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-color magneto-optical trapping of ytterbium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report laser cooling and trapping of ytterbium atoms in a two-color magneto-optical trap (MOT). Benefited from both the broad singlet transition ($^1\text{S}_0\rightarrow {}^1\text{P}_1$) and the narrow intercombination transition ($^1\text{S}_0\rightarrow {}^3\text{P}_1$) of ytterbium atoms, the two-color MOT enables rapid loading and efficient cooling. We systematically investigate the shielding effect of the intercombination transition by examining the atom loading and loss rates of single-color and two-color MOTs. Our findings are general and can be extended to other alkaline earth(-like) atoms.</description>

      <title>Complex Berry phase and steady-state geometric amplification in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the dynamics of coupled oscillators is important for a wide range of scientific and technological endeavors. Two concepts that have generated new insights into this topic are Berry phase (oscillators' memory of how they have been tuned) and non-Hermiticity (damping and its often counter-intuitive consequences). Here we describe measurements of the interplay between these two phenomena that highlight the qualitative changes they induce in each other. In particular, non-Hermiticity changes the Berry phase from a real to a complex number, opening new avenues for controlling the flow of energy in oscillators. We illustrate this by demonstrating a broadly applicable means for converting a system's intrinsic damping into a novel form of amplification.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Spinning Test Body in quadratic Einstein-Cartan Theory and its Free-fall Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory(ECT), in which the weak equivalence principle is violated by the spin-gravitational interaction. We derive the general equation of geodesic in terms of comoving tetrads. More concretely, we consider the case of the quadratic form of the lagrangian, within the environment of weak and static spherically symmetric space-time. We find that the trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\textendash Papapetrou equation, which is due to the coupling of the spin of the test particle to the torsion field of the environment. This allows us to test the theory with free-fall experiment in the laboratory, such as atom interferometer. By using the previous data, we find the upper bound of the possible torsion field on Earth is given by up to $2.0\times 10^{1} \mathrm{~m^{-1}}$ and torsion gradient up to $3.1 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{~m^{-2}}$. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical foundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth force.</description>

      <title>How interacting Bose gases scatter light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation of quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into already occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\rm f}$, where $N_{\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have a dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local) beyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can completely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive ones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme sensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light scattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Optically-biased Rydberg microwave receiver enabled by hybrid nonlinear interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of Rydberg vapors medium both to microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g. weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of conventional RF antenna in the detector. The trouble with this approach arises, as the greatest sensitivity is exhibited with the use of additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, and the measurement can no longer be all-optical. Here we propose a different solution, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining exceptional sensitivity. We tackle the issue of laser phase noise, emerging in this type of detection, via a simultaneous measurement of the phase spectrum in a nonlinear process and real-time data processing, which overall yields an improvement of $35\ \mathrm{dB}$ in terms of signal-to-noise ratio compared with the basic approach. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field. This approach is directly comparable to the state of the art superheterodyne, while retaining the merits of all-optical detection.</description>

      <title>Hearing carrier-envelope offset frequency and phase in air with a microphone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond science and frequency metrology rely on the precise measurement and control of the laser pulse waveform, a feat traditionally achieved using optoelectronic techniques. In this study, we conducted a laser-induced acoustic experiment in air ionized by carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-stabilized sub-4 femtosecond pulses. Our results reveal that the acoustic signal exhibits CEP dependence in few-cycle pulses, primarily through amplitude modulation from laser-driven ionization. This novel optoacoustic phenomenon enables not only the measurement of the carrier-envelope offset frequency but also the direct characterization of the waveform of optical pulses through a microphone. Our study highlights the potential of laser-induced acoustic waves for advancing frequency metrology and ultrafast science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superpositions of handed molecular states give rise to achiral eigenstates, delocalized across a double-well potential via tunneling. A coherent superposition of these energy eigenstates could dynamically relocalize the molecules into chiral states, which has only been addressed theoretically. Here, we present a microwave six-wave mixing pump-probe study to create and probe coherent chiral tunneling dynamics in a rotational state. Through a time-resolved scheme, we uncover the periodic time evolution of the induced chiral wavepacket under field-free conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate precise phase control of this coherence via phase modulation during pump excitation.</description>

Abstract: A measurement of parity violation in the hyperfine structure of $^{138}$Ba$^{19}$F [E. Altunta\c{s} et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 142501 (2018)] is reinterpreted with electronic structure calculations in terms of beyond Standard Model vector boson mediated electron-nucleus interactions. Our results set constraints on previously unexplored, new boson mediated axial vector-vector nucleus-electron interactions. Similar bounds are obtained by analyzing the atomic parity violation experiment with $^{133}$Cs. Moreover, we show that future experiments with cold heavy diatomic molecules like $^{225}$RaF can improve the present sensitivity to axial vector-vector nucleus-electron and nucleon-nucleus interactions by up to five orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly-polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. We verify our predicted complementary response in rubidium vapour cell experiments and through density matrix calculations. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic polarimetry for quantum metrological electric field characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CERN AD/ELENA Antimatter program studies the fundamental charge, parity, time (CPT) reversal invariance through high-precision studies of antiprotons, antihydrogen, and antiprotonic atoms. Utilizing the world-unique Antiproton Decelerator (AD) and the Extra Low Energy Antiproton (ELENA) decelerator, the program supports multiple groundbreaking experiments aimed at testing fundamental symmetries, probing gravity with antimatter, and investigating potential asymmetric antimatter/dark matter interactions. Some experiments focus on precision spectroscopy of antihydrogen, while others conduct the most precise tests of CPT invariance in the baryon sector by comparing proton and antiproton properties. Other efforts are dedicated to measure the ballistic properties of antihydrogen under gravity and performing antiproton-based studies of neutron skins in exotic nuclei. These efforts have led to major breakthroughs, including the first trapped antihydrogen, antihydrogen's first gravitational acceleration measurement, and record-breaking precision CPT-tests in the baryon sector.
  With continuous advancements in antimatter cooling, trapping, and transport, CERN's program is opening new frontiers in fundamental physics. Future goals, described in this document and reaching to timelines beyond 2040, include further improving the precision of antimatter studies, developing transportable antimatter traps, and advancing our understanding of quantum field theory, gravity, and dark matter interactions. Furthermore, new areas of hadron physics with antiprotons will be explored through studies of the Pontecorvo reaction, antineutron annihilation dynamics and hypernuclei decays. The CERN AD/ELENA Antimatter program remains at the forefront of experimental physics, pushing the limits of precision measurements to unravel the mysteries of the universe.</description>

      <title>Revisiting inelastic Cu+H collisions and the non-LTE Galactic evolution of copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Galactic evolution of copper remains poorly understood, partly due to the strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) affecting Cu I lines. A key source of uncertainty in non-LTE modelling is the treatment of inelastic Cu+H collisions. We present new rate coefficients based on a combined asymptotic LCAO and free electron model approach, which show significant differences from previous calculations. Applying these updated rates to non-LTE stellar modelling, we find reduced line-to-line scatter and improved consistency between metal-poor dwarfs and giants. Our non-LTE analysis reveals a strong upturn in the [Cu/Fe] trend towards lower [Fe/H] &lt; -1.7. We show that this may reflect the interplay between external enrichment of Cu-rich material of the Milky Way halo at low metallicities, and metallicity-dependent Cu yields from rapidly rotating massive stars. This highlights the unique diagnostic potential of accurate Cu abundances for understanding both stellar and Galactic evolution.</description>
