      <title>Multiscale modelling of thermally stressed superelastic polyimide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many thermo-mechanical processes, such as thermal expansion and stress relaxation, originate at the atomistic scale. We develop a sequential multiscale approach to study thermally stressed superelastic polyimide to explore these effects. The continuum-scale smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model is coupled with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) through constitutive modelling, where thermo-mechanical properties and equations of state are derived from MD simulations. The results are verified through benchmark problems of heat transfer. Finally, we analyse the insulating capabilities of superelastic polyimide by simulating the thermal response of an aluminium plate. The result shows a considerable reduction in the thermal stress, strain and temperature field development in the aluminium plate when superelastic polyimide is used as an insulator. The present work demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-scale method in capturing thermo-mechanical interactions in superelastic polyimide.</description>

      <title>Hinge electronic structure of strained half-Heuslers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-Heusler compounds are a class of materials with great potential for the study of distinct electronic states. In this work, we investigate, from first-principles, the possibility of hinge modes in closely related topological phases that are tunable by moderate uni-axial strain. We consider two compounds: LiSbZn and LiBiZn. While LiSbZn has a topologically trivial band structure, the larger spin-orbit coupling of Bi causes a band inversion in LiBiZn. We predict the existence of topologically trivial hinge states in both cases. The hinge modes are affected by both the crystal termination, and the bulk topological phase transitions, albeit indirectly: when present, topological surface modes hybridize with the hinge states and obscure their visibility. Thus, we find that the most visible hinge modes occur when no band inversions are present in the material. Our work highlights the interplay and competition between surface and hinge modes in half-Heuslers, and may help guide the experimental search for robust boundary signatures in these materials</description>

      <title>Nucleation of dislocations in metals: order parameters, transition state, and kinetic rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations are prominent defects in metals, significantly influencing their mechanical, electronic, thermal, and chemical properties. The emergence of such collective defects is typically characterized by nucleation and amplification phases. However, while their dynamical propagation can be followed in great detail, e.g., via atomistic simulations, accurately characterizing the mechanism, transition state, and kinetic rates of dislocations' nucleation is still a fundamental challenge. One main problem is that identifying well-suited descriptor(s) (order parameter) for characterizing the nucleation process is non-trivial, and a rigorous approach to assess and rank descriptors in this sense is still missing. In this work, we investigate the nucleation of dislocations in an ideal fcc copper crystal using replicated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from configurations of the lattice close to the limit between the elastic and the plastic phases. Using different types of descriptors (order parameters), we obtain from the atomistic trajectories time-series data that we study via committor analyses and statistical inference methods. Our findings highlight the effect of the order parameter's choice on the description of the nucleation phenomenon. By applying a recently-demonstrated variational principle to stochastic models built on our data, we estimate the free-energy barriers and kinetic rates for dislocation nucleation. Systematic comparison with the "ground truth" (brute force) nucleation rate then provides us a robust approach for ranking the order parameters based on their accuracy in describing the dislocation nucleation process in this copper crystalline system. This approach is general and useful for probing the transition state and studying nucleation events in a variety of other systems.</description>

      <title>Sparse mixed linear modeling with anchor-based guidance for high-entropy alloy discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys have attracted attention for their exceptional mechanical properties and thermal stability. However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible elemental compositions renders traditional trial-and-error experimental approaches highly inefficient for materials discovery. To solve this problem, machine learning techniques have been increasingly employed for property prediction and high-throughput screening. Nevertheless, highly accurate nonlinear models often suffer from a lack of interpretability, which is a major limitation. In this study, we focus on local data structures that emerge from the greedy search behavior inherent to experimental data acquisition. By introducing a linear and low-dimensional mixture regression model, we strike a balance between predictive performance and model interpretability. In addition, we develop an algorithm that simultaneously performs prediction and feature selection by considering multiple candidate descriptors. Through a case study on high-entropy alloys, this study introduces a method that combines anchor-guided clustering and sparse linear modeling to address biased data structures arising from greedy exploration in materials science.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Formation of Single Organic Color Centers in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum light sources using single-walled carbon nanotubes show promise for quantum technologies but face challenges in achieving precise control over color center formation. Here we present a novel technique for deterministic creation of single organic color centers in carbon nanotubes using \textit{in-situ} photochemical reaction. By monitoring discrete intensity changes in photoluminescence spectra, we achieve precise control over the formation of individual color centers. Furthermore, our method allows for position-controlled formation of color centers as validated through photoluminescence imaging. We also demonstrate photon antibunching from a color center, confirming the quantum nature of the defects formed. This technique represents a significant step forward in the precise engineering of atomically defined quantum emitters in carbon nanotubes, facilitating their integration into advanced quantum photonic devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable Thermal Expansion in Functionalized 2D Boron Nitride: A First-Principles Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermal expansion coefficient of two-dimensional (2D) functionalized boron nitride (f-BN) materials using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). Two-dimensional materials, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties. However, the influence of functionalization on the thermal expansion behavior remains largely unexplored. In this work, DFT calculations are employed to analyze how different functionalized forms of h-BN impact the thermal expansion of BN sheets. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and the quasiharmonic approximation (QAH) are utilized to determine the thermal expansion coefficient over a range of temperatures. The results reveal that functionalization induces notable modifications in the in-plane thermal expansion of BN, affecting material stability and suggesting potential applications in nanoelectronics and thermal management. This investigation provides critical insights into the tunability of the thermal properties of 2D BN, underscoring its suitability for next-generation flexible and high-performance devices.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced modulation of the ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase fraction in FeRh films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With his huge entropy change and a strong interplay between magnetic order, structural and electrical properties, the first-order antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic phase transition is a paradigmatic example of the multicaloric effect. The unraveling of the physics underlying the phase transition needs a better understanding of the thermal hysteresis of FeRh within the AF-FM phase coexistence region. In this work, we compare the effect of two very different types of thermal cycling on the hysteresis of the magnetic order: quasi-static heating, and cooling of the entire 195 nm thick film, and a f =100 kHz modulated heating driven by a laser focused down to a spot of about ten micron squared at the film surface. Taking advantage of the reflectivity difference between both phases to probe optically their respective fraction, we show that whereas only temperature-driven reflectivity variations (dR/dT , thermoreflectance) are detected in the pure phases, a huge modulation of the phase-dependent reflectance at the driving frequency f is detected in the phase coexistence temperature range. This is quantitatively described as resulting from a substantial modulation of the FM fraction (up to 90%) with increasing laser power. A simplified rate-independent hysteresis model with return-point-memory (RPM), represented in terms of bistable units that undergo a temperature excursion corresponding to a given laser power, reproduces very well the optically measured FM phase modulation characteristics for a broad range of temperature excursions. This offers an insight into the leading role of quenched disorder in defining thermal hysteresis in FeRh under high excitation frequency, when the material is periodically driven out-of-equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A DFT study on 18-crown-6-like-N$_8$ structure as a material for metal-ions storage: stability and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing electrode materials with exceptional electrical conductivity, robust chemical stability, rapid charge and discharge rates, and high storage capacity is essential for advancing high-performance metal-ion batteries. This study explores the two-dimensional, 18-crown-6-like N8 structure (2D-N8) as a promising electrode material for next-generation rechargeable post-lithium batteries. We thoroughly investigated the pristine N8 structures, focusing on their stability and performance metrics. Our analysis revealed remarkable structural stability across the board. Additionally, electronic calculations indicated a small band gap of 0.54 eV for the N8 monolayer, suggesting favorable electronic properties for battery applications. When we evaluated a series of metal ions as adsorbates, we found that the pristine N8 monolayer achieved an impressive storage capacity of 1675 mAh/g for sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg) ions, highlighting its potential for effective ion storage. Our findings suggest that the engineered 2D-N8 structure offers a unique combination of stability and electrochemical performance that could significantly contribute to developing efficient and durable energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>AIM: A User-friendly GUI Workflow program for Isotherm Fitting, Mixture Prediction, Isosteric Heat of Adsorption Estimation, and Breakthrough Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments and scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines fixed-bed adsorption analysis through an integrated workflow for isotherm fitting, heat of adsorption estimation, mixture prediction, and multicomponent breakthrough simulations. AIM's intuitive GUI requires no coding and supports a broad isotherm library (e.g., Langmuir, Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov, Structural-Transition-Adsorption). It also enables non-isothermal breakthrough simulations with axial dispersion. Case studies, such as Xe/Kr breakthrough curves in SBMOF-1, closely match the results from other software applications, such as RUPTURA. Mixture predictions can be done using the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) and Extended Langmuir models, while isosteric heats are derived from Clausius-Clapeyron or Virial equations. Users can export detailed column and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple formats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners.</description>

      <title>Flexible Perovskite/Silicon Monolithic Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 30% Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to their excellent properties of low cost, lightweight, portability, and conformity, flexible perovskite-based tandem solar cells show great potentials for energy harvesting applications, with flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem solar cells particularly promising for achieving high efficiency. However, performance of flexible perovskite/c-silicon monolithic tandem solar cells still greatly lags, due to challenges in simultaneously achieving both efficient photocarrier transport and reliable mitigation of residual stress. Here, we reveal the critical role of perovskite phase homogeneity, for achieving high-efficient and mechanical-stable flexible perovskite/c-silicon heterojunction monolithic tandem solar cells (PSTs) with textured surface. Through ensuring high phase homogeneity, which promotes charge transfer across all facets of the pyramid on the textured substrates and releases the residual stress at the perovskite/c-silicon interface, we demonstrate flexible PSTs with a bending curvature of 0.44 cm-1, and a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.88% (1.04 cm2 aperture area), surpassing all other types of flexible perovskite-based photovoltaic devices. Our results can lead to broad applications and commercialization of flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Materials Database from All-electron Hybrid Functional DFT Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials databases built from calculations based on density functional approximations play an important role in the discovery of materials with improved properties. Most databases thus constructed rely on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for electron exchange and correlation. This limits the reliability of these databases, as well as the artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on them, for certain classes of materials and properties which are not well described by GGA. In this paper, we describe a database of 7,024 inorganic materials presenting diverse structures and compositions generated using hybrid functional calculations enabled by their efficient implementation in the all-electron code FHI-aims. The database is used to evaluate the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of oxides relevant to catalysis and energy related applications. We illustrate how the database can be used to train AI models for material properties using the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) approach.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Extremely Strong Defect-Phonon Scatterings in Semiconductor Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of doping in tailoring thermal transport in semiconductors is critical for efficient thermal management in electronic devices. While the effects of doping have been extensively studied to tune electrical properties, its impact on thermal transport has not yet been thoroughly explored, particularly with respect to experimental investigations into exceptionally strong non-Rayleigh defect-phonon scattering phenomena. Herein, by combining the high-quality growth and advanced characterizations of cubic silicon carbide single crystals with well controlled boron doping, we experimentally observe anomalous strong defect-phonon scatterings, among the strongest reported in common semiconductors, that exceeds the predictions of the classic mass difference model by tens of times in magnitude. The measured thermal conductivity of doped 3C SiC match excellently with those predicted by first principle calculations in which resonant scattering of low frequency phonon is considered. Our findings not only shed light on the fundamental understanding of defect-phonon interactions and will also impact applications such as thermal management of electronics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced activity in layered-metal-oxide-based oxygen evolution catalysts by layer-by-layer modulation of metal ion identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-layered potassium nickel and cobalt oxides show drastic differences in catalytic activity based on metal ion preorganization. Uniform compositions $[(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6$ or $(\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ show limited activity, while homogenously-mixed-metal cobalt/nickel oxides $[(\mathrm{Co}_n\mathrm{Ni}_{1-n}\mathrm{O}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ display moderate improvement. However, a layer-by-layer arrangement of cobalt and nickel oxide sheets [e.g., $(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})$] provides superior catalytic performance, reducing the oxygen evolution overpotential by more than 400 mV. Density functional theory simulations provide an illustration of the electronic properties (density of states and localization of orbitals) that promote catalysis in the layer-segregated materials over those of homogeneous composition. This study reveals that atomic preorganization of metal ions within layered catalysts plays a more crucial role than overall metal composition in enhancing catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Behavior from the Atomic Blueprint: Machine Learning-Guided Design of Spatially Functionalized a-SiO2 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control over surface chemistry is essential for tuning interfacial behavior in technologies ranging from catalysis and protective coatings to energy conversion systems. Although chemical functionalization of alpha-quartz (alpha-SiO2) with hydroxyl (OH) and methyl (CH3) groups has been extensively studied, the impact of their spatial distribution at the atomic scale remains largely uncharted. In this work, we integrate density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate how different arrangements of OH/CH3 groups modulate surface properties. Our results reveal that spatial patterning governs the formation of hydrogen-bonding networks, alters vibrational signatures, and has a significant influence on the thermodynamic stability of the functionalized surfaces. The MLFF framework enables high-fidelity simulations at unprecedented scales, bridging the gap between quantum accuracy and statistical sampling. By uncovering structure-property relationships inaccessible to conventional approaches, this study establishes spatial arrangement of functionalized groups as a critical and tunable design axis, paving the way for the predictive engineering of silica-based materials with optimized interfacial performance.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Enhanced Fenton-Like Processes by Nanofibers: Real-Time Observation of Tetracycline Degradation in Pig Manure Wastewater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) in pig manure wastewater using magnet-ite-based magnetic nanofibers (MNFs) as heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. The MNFs, composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) embedded with MnFe_2O_4 nanoparticles, were synthesized via electrospinning and exhibited high stability and catalytic efficiency. The degradation process was driven by hydroxyl radical (OH) formation through hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation on the MNF surface. The results showed that TC was first adsorbed onto the MNFs before undergoing oxidation, with treatment efficiency increasing with H2O2 concentration up to an optimum point, due to increased OH scavenging by H_2O_2. A heterogeneous dynamic kinetic model (DKM) was developed to describe the degradation mechanism, incorporating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, catalyst surface inactivation, and polymer strip-ping effects. Furthermore, the application of an alternating magnetic field significantly accelerated the reaction rate, likely due to localized heating effects. This study highlights the potential of MNFs as a scalable, reusable and efficient alternative for antibiotic-contaminated wastewater treatment, offering advantages over conventional homogeneous Fenton processes by minimizing iron sludge formation and broadening the operational pH range.</description>

      <title>Supervised Pretraining for Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of material properties facilitates the discovery of novel materials with tailored functionalities. Deep learning models have recently shown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property relationships. However, these models often rely on supervised learning, which requires large, well-annotated datasets an expensive and time-consuming process. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by pretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can be fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose supervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate labels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material properties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and introduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance representation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that injects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material graphs. The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging material property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over baselines, ranging from 2% to 6.67% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction. This study represents the first exploration of supervised pertaining with surrogate labels in material property prediction, advancing methodology and application in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigated the phenomenon of non-contact resistance by inserting a non-magnetic metal rod into an induction coil to explore the response changes of an LRC circuit. We focused on analyzing the changes in inductance when non-ferromagnetic materials (such as H59 brass) were inserted into the coil and verified the impact of the copper rod on inductance through theoretical derivation and experimental validation. Based on Maxwell's equations, the magnetic field distribution within the copper rod was thoroughly derived, and the inductance and resistance values were experimentally measured. These results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Self-consistency error correction for accurate machine learning potentials from variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) can be used to train accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials on time scales and for system sizes previously unattainable. VMC training sets are often based on partially optimized wave functions (WFs) to circumvent expensive energy optimizations of the whole set of WF parameters. However, frozen variational parameters lead to VMC forces and pressures not consistent with the underlying potential energy surface, a bias called the self-consistency error (SCE). Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the accuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test case. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109, 205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a Jastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The MLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can approach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs. Our conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs trained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical observables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended high-quality training sets with VMC.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian learning of triplon excitations in an artificial nanoscale molecular quantum magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting the Hamiltonian of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in correlated quantum matter. Here we put forward a machine learning strategy to extract the spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows to directly extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the different exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that can be used to predict the Hamiltonian of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable learning a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A multireference picture of electronic excited states in vanadyl and copper tetraphenyl porphyrin molecular qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of electronic excited states has a deep impact on the dynamics of molecular spins, but remains poorly understood and characterized. Here we carry out a thorough multiconfigurational investigation for two prototypical molecular qubits based on vanadyl and copper tetra-phenyl porphyrins. State-average CASSCF and NEVPT2 calculations have been employed with four different active spaces of growing complexity to account for the d-d, second d-shell, ligand-to-metal charge transfer states and $\pi-\pi^*$ excited states, revealing an in-depth picture of low-lying excited states in agreement with experimental observations. The largest active spaces attempted, (13,14) for the vanadyl and (17,12) for the copper compounds, reveal that the lowest-lying excited states originate from $\pi-\pi^*$ quartet excitations. These findings shed light on the nature of the excited states of molecular qubits, taking an important step toward elucidating their role in molecular spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Energy Dissipation in Non-Contact Single-Molecule Junctions Governed by Local Geometry and Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.</description>

Abstract: The impact semiconductor drift step recovery diodes (DSRDs) can have on high-power microwave applications make them a device of interest for future solid-state electronics. However, there is little known about their functionality and degradation under over-voltaging or high average power dissipation conditions that could therefore hinder their continual design and optimization toward better performance. The experiments on a Si seven layer DSRD conducted in the present paper allowed to broaden the understanding of its opening switching performance under over-voltaging conditions. A striking desynchronization was discovered and linked to junction and electro-neutral region damage through experiments and PSpice modelling.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heterogeneity within Elastic and Inelastic Discrete Mechanical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study investigates the elastic and fracture behaviors of discrete, elastically homogeneous models of heterogeneous media. The homogeneity is accomplished either by volumetric-deviatoric decomposition of constitutive function or by an auxiliary stress homogenization method. The elastic parameters of the homogenized material models are randomly varied in space to introduce heterogeneity independently of the geometric properties of the discrete model. Several forms of randomization are investigated using statistical properties of nodal stress oscillations in periodic representative volume elements (RVEs). It is found that the stress oscillations present in discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures with standard constitutive models cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions as well as dependencies between stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched.
  With respect to quasi-brittle fracture behavior, the macroscopic response of the different models is studied for the load case of uniaxial tension. The elastically homogenized material provides higher peak stress occurring at lower strain levels and a steeper softening phase, compared to the standard material. Randomization of the elastic material parameters, as well as adjustment of inelastic material parameters, brings the macroscopic response of the homogenized material close to that of the standard material, although the damage distribution prior to the strain localization differs. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled, random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models, using physically-based discretizations of material structure with standard constitutive models for comparison.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the superconductivity in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant attention due to their promising low-power applications and fundamental scientific interest. Here, we report some novel stable non-van der Waals Nb$_x$N$_{x+1}$ ($x$ = 1-4) monolayers derived from the NbN bulk exfoliated along the (001) plane, as identified through first-principles calculations. Among these monolayers, Nb$_2$N$_3$, which crystallizes in the $P \overline{6} m2$ symmetry, stands out with an exceptional superconducting transition temperature of 77.8 K, setting a new high-$T_c$ benchmark for two-dimensional transition metal nitrides and binary compounds. Our detailed analysis reveals that the strong superconductivity in Nb$_2$N$_3$ is driven by phonon modes dominated by N vibrations, with significant electron-phonon coupling contributions from N-$p$ and Nb-$d$ electronic states. Using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg framework, we further determine the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in the Nb$_2$N$_3$ monolayer, characterized by pronounced electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic energy gaps. These results advance our understanding of superconductivity in 2D transition metal nitride and highlight their potential for nanoscale superconducting applications.</description>

      <title>A Quieter State of Charge -- Ultra-Low-Noise Collective Current in Charge-Density-Wave Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) charge-density-wave (CDW) systems, electric current comprises normal electrons and a collective, electron-lattice condensate current associated with CDW sliding. While achieving the dissipation-less Frohlich current of the sliding condensate is impossible in real materials, one can imagine an important related target, namely reaching the electron transport regime where electronic noise is inhibited due to the collective, strongly-correlated nature of the electron-lattice condensate current. Here we report that in nanowires of the fully-gapped CDW material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. This discovery signals intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated transport regime. The dominant noise source due to fluctuations in the CDW depinning threshold is extrinsic and caused by lattice imperfections that locally pin the condensate. Once the bias voltage is well past threshold and the sliding mode is established, the normalized noise drops below the noise of normal electrons. No residual minimum noise level is observed for the current of the condensate. Since flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices, our discovery introduces a fundamentally new strategy for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics using strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Soft-X-ray momentum microscopy of nonlinear magnon interactions below 100-nm wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the amplitude and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.</description>

Abstract: The present study focuses on the intrinsic properties of the SmFe10Co2-xVx (x = 0-2) alloys, which includes the SmFe10Co2 alloy, one of the most promising permanent magnets with the ThMn12 type of structure due to its large saturation magnetization (1.78 T), high Curie temperature (Tc = 859 K), and anisotropy field (12 T) experimentally obtained. Unfortunately, its low coercivity (&lt;0.4 T) hinders its use in permanent magnet applications. The effect of V-doping on magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and Curie temperature is investigated by electronic band structure calculations. The spin-polarized fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) band structure method, which employs the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with substitutional disorder, has been used. The Hubbard-U correction to local spin density approximation (LSDA +U) was used to account for the large correlation effects due to the 4f electronic states of Sm. The computed magnetic moments and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies were compared with existing experimental data to validate the theoretical approach's reliability. The exchange-coupling parameters from the Heisenberg model were used for obtaining the mean-field estimated Curie temperature. The magnetic anisotropy energy was separated into contributions from transition metals and Sm, and its relationships with the local environment, interatomic distances, and valence electron delocalization were analyzed. The suitability of the hypothetical SmFe10CoV alloy for permanent magnet manufacture was assessed using the calculated anisotropy field, magnetic hardness, and intrinsic magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Mysteries of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: 3D Magnetism in a layered like Magnet</title>

Abstract: GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric magnet with a square lattice of Gd atoms, hosts a short-period skyrmion square lattice (SkL) without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). RKKY-type exchange between the Gd moments results in an exchange frustration, which is the main source of non-collinearity in the spiral phases of the system. Previous studies focused on the in-plane $\vec{Q}$ vectors in understanding the magnetic phases of the system as they appear and have been observed on the 2D Gd layers. In this work, we calculate the Gd-Gd magnetic exchange interactions ($J_{ij}$) and perform atomic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, providing new insights about GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our calculated $J_{ij}$ shows that the strongest magnetic interaction occurs between Gd atoms along the [111] body-diagonal direction of the unit cell. This, along with the body-centered tetragonal structure of the Gd sublattice, points to the presence of a hitherto ignored modulation vector, $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$, along the [111] direction in the spiral phases of the system. ASD simulations confirm this interlayer modulation, demonstrating that GdRu$_2$Si$_2$'s magnetic phases are more complex than suggested by 2D layer observations. The total magnetic order is determined by $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$ alongside intralayer $\vec{Q}_{[100]}$ and $\vec{Q}_{[010]}$, establishing GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ as a strong 3D magnet requiring comprehensive theoretical modeling. Considering these, our ASD simulations accurately reproduce experimental phase transitions and highlight the significant role of dipolar interactions (due to the large Gd moment) over a weak uniaxial anisotropy in determining the ground state. This work enhances the understanding of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$'s complex magnetism, suggesting similar interlayer effects may be important in other layered magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>The reliability of hybrid functionals for accurate fundamental and optical gap prediction of bulk solids and surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid functionals have been considered insufficiently reliable for the prediction of band gaps in solids and surfaces. We revisit this issue with a new generation of optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functionals, focusing on the reconstructed Si(111)-(2x1) and Ge(111)-(2x1) surfaces. We show that certain hybrid functionals can accurately predict the surface-state and bulk fundamental and optical gaps, as well as projected band structures of these surfaces, by combining ground-state and time-dependent density functional theory.</description>

      <title>3D variational autoencoder for fingerprinting microstructure volume elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.</description>

      <title>Predicting Methane Adsorption in Metal-Substituted MOFs: A Comparative Study between Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energies between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the fine-tuned heat of adsorption model and uptake model qualitatively predict adsorption properties for original unaltered MOFs, they fail to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects at open metal sites significantly impact adsorption behaviors. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanoscale charged colloid crystallization near a metastable liquid binodal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16808v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Competing charge density wave phases in YNiC2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.</description>

      <title>Spin-Transfer Torque in Altermagnets with Magnetic Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of anisotropic spin-transfer torque effect in textured altermagnets. To this end, we generalize the Zhang-Li torque to incorporate the symmetry associated with prototypical $d$-wave altermagnets and identify the spin-splitter adiabatic and nonadiabatic torques. Applying our results to domain wall dynamics induced by spin-transfer torque, we find that, in certain regimes, the spin-splitter adiabatic torque can induce domain wall precession, significantly slowing down domain wall motion. The response of the domain wall also becomes anisotropic, reflecting the $d$-wave symmetry of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we observe that the spin-splitter adiabatic torque modifies skyrmion dynamics, inducing anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect. The above phenomena can serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in textured magnets, distinguishing it from the behavior of ordinary antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics of Dissipative Polarizable Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. We then apply our theory to the study of the optical response of two plasmonic systems. Furthermore, by exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>When Adiabaticity Is Not Enough to Study Topological Phases in Solid-State Physics: Comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan Phases in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases emerge as the parameters of a quantum system vary with time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependence can be eliminated, allowing the Berry topological phase to be obtained from a closed trajectory in parameter space. In solid-state physics, this approach is commonly applied by taking a reciprocal space wavevector as the parameter, which is assumed to be varied by electromagnetic fields.The Berry curvature is then obtained by computing the derivatives of Bloch wavefunctions in reciprocal space. However, in many systems-especially gapless ones-the adiabatic approximation is never satisfied. This is particularly true in Dirac and Weyl materials, where the Berry curvature is often calculated without considering the breakdown of the adiabatic condition. In this work, we demonstrate how other time-dependent topological quantities, specifically the Aharonov-Anandan phase, can be used to extract information not only about topology but also about band transitions in 2D materials. In particular, a relationship between the current and the Aharonov-Anandan phase is proved, showing that photon-induced transitions produce current vortices. To illustrate this, we analyze graphene under electromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, showing how the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary insights into topology, interband transitions, and currents. This is achieved by using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.</description>
