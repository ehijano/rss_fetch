      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that while the hydrodynamic modes remain unaffected by local field redefinition, the non-hydrodynamic modes are sensitive to it and can be eliminated through an appropriate all-order redefinition. This leads to a new hydro frame, where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We further show that the resulting stress tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode, illustrating its control over the validity of the hydrodynamic expansion. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Nucleon thermalization hindered by isospin symmetry: Violation of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bohr's compound nucleus theory is one of the most important models in nuclear physics, with far-reaching applications in nuclear science and technology. This model generally assumes that the participating nucleons attain a thermal equilibrium characterized by the microcanonical ensemble before subsequent decays. However, from a theoretical viewpoint, it remains uncertain whether this assumption is universally valid. In this Letter, we critically examine this longstanding assumption through the lens of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), a cornerstone of the modern quantum thermalization theory. Utilizing the time-dependent configuration interaction shell model, it is found that, in certain cases, the long-time averages of nucleon occupation numbers can exhibit significant deviations from the microcanonical ensemble averages, in contrast to the conventional expectation. We attribute this discrepancy primarily to the violation of the ETH in the presence of isospin symmetry and discover that incorporating a substantial isospin-breaking term into the shell-model Hamiltonian can effectively restore the nucleon thermalization.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent Fermi systems at low densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate, to second order in the scattering length between two fermions, the Landau quasiparticle interaction for a low-density mixture of two fermion species with unequal densities at temperature zero. From the Landau parameters we evaluate the energy density and find agreement with the result of Kanno, Prog. Theor. Phys. 44, 813 (1970). The calculations are then extended to the case of two fermion components with different total densities, each with two spin components, a situation of interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics, where the species are neutrons and protons. An interesting finding is that, for low proton concentrations, $x \ll 1$, the leading term in the energy density, beyond the $x^{5/3}$ contribution from the kinetic energy and the $x^2$ one due to the two-body interaction in the mean-field approximation, varies as $x^{7/3} \ln x$. This is to be contrasted with the higher powers of $x$ implicit in many phenomenological energy-density functionals employed in nuclear physics, such as those of the Skyrme type.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium expectations for non-Gaussian fluctuations near a QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the highly anticipated results from the Beam Energy Scan II program at RHIC being recently revealed, an understanding of particle-number fluctuations and their significance as a potential signature of a possible QCD critical point is crucial. Early works that embarked on this endeavor sought to estimate the fluctuations due to the presence of a critical point assuming they stay in equilibrium. From these results came the proposal to focus efforts on higher, non-Gaussian, moments of the event-by-event distributions, in particular of the number of protons. These non-Gaussian moments are especially sensitive to critical fluctuations, as their magnitudes are proportional to high powers of the critical correlation length. As the equation of state provides key input for hydrodynamical simulations of heavy-ion collisions, we estimate equilibrium fluctuations from the BEST equation of state (EoS) that includes critical features from the 3D Ising Model. In particular, the proton factorial cumulants and their dependence on non-universal mapping parameters is investigated within the BEST EoS. Furthermore, the correlation length, as a central quantity for the assessment of fluctuations in the vicinity of a critical point, is also calculated in a consistent manner with the scaling equation of state. An understanding of the equilibrium estimates of proton factorial cumulants will be useful for further comparison to estimates of out-of-equilibrium fluctuations in order to determine the magnitude of the observable fluctuations to be expected in heavy-ion collision experiments, in which the time spent near a critical point is short.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>

      <title>Partial-wave projection of relativistic three-body amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the integral equations for partial-wave projected three-body scattering amplitudes, starting from the integral equations for three-body amplitudes developed for lattice QCD analyses. The results, which hold for generic three-body systems of spinless particles, build upon the recently derived partial-wave projected one-particle exchange, a primary component of the relativistic framework proven to satisfy S matrix unitarity. We derive simplified expressions for factorizable short-distance interactions, $\mathcal{K}_{3}$, in two equivalent formalisms - one symmetric under particle interchange and one asymmetric. For the asymmetric case, we offer parameterizations useful for amplitude analysis. Finally, we examine toy models for $3\pi$ systems at unphysically heavy pion masses with total isospins 0,1, and 2.</description>

      <title>Twist-2 distribution amplitudes of $a_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(1450)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on QCD sum rules, we investigate the twist-2 distribution amplitudes of the scalar mesons $a_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(1450)$. We have derived the moments for these scalar mesons, composed of two constituent valence quarks, to the first order by selecting appropriate correlation functions. Subsequently, we have determined the first two Gegenbauer coefficients of these scalar mesons, employing these moments, we further analyze the twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitudes for the $a_{0}$ meson. The paper concludes with an examination of the weak decay widths for the transitions $B,D\rightarrow a_{0}$.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic method to derive the chiral kinetic theory from the Wigner equations based on quantum field theory order by order. We take special effort to derive the chiral kinetic theory in seven-dimensional phase space from the eight-dimensional chiral kinetic theory. We give the seven-dimensional chiral kinetic theory up to second order of semiclassical expansion. We find some new second-order contributions compared with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring the neutral pion production data of MINER$\nu$A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the neutrino experiments advancing towards high-precision measurements and greater emphasis on reducing systematic uncertainties, embedding the single-pion production models, a major component of the hadronic activity observed in the neutrino oscillation experiments, into the Monte Carlo simulations is crucial. This work presents the measurements of the struck nucleon's Fermi motion with the transverse kinematic imbalance approach by analyzing the charged-current neutral pion production on carbon nucleus in MINER$\nu$A. A minimal tuning of GENIE and NuWro based on their default models shows an improvement in the prediction of single $\pi^0$ production. The prediction describes the data more accurately in the higher momentum tail however, discrepancies between the predictions and data below the Fermi peak highlight the limitations in current nuclear models used in the Monte Carlo generators.</description>

      <title>Evidence of collinear factorization breaking due to collinear-to-soft Glauber exchanges for a $2 \to 3$ exclusive process at leading twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit an exclusive process, namely the photoproduction of a $\pi^{0}\gamma$ pair with large invariant mass, which violates collinear factorization. We explicitly demonstrate that this is due to the fact that there exists diagrams with gluon exchange in $t$ channel, contributing at the leading power, for which Glauber gluons are trapped. This is caused by the pinching of the contour integration of both the plus and minus light-cone components of the Glauber gluon momentum. We argue that this leads to the observed ``endpoint-like'' divergence of the convolution integral at leading order and leading power when collinear factorization is na\"ively assumed.</description>

      <title>Going against the flow: Revealing the QCD degrees of freedom in hadronic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In collisions between heavy nuclei, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, hydrodynamic models have successfully related measured azimuthal momentum anisotropies to the transverse shape of the collision region. For an elliptically shaped interaction area, the hydrodynamic pressure gradient is greater along the minor axis, resulting in increased particle momentum in that direction - a phenomenon known as positive elliptic flow. In this paper, we demonstrate that in smaller systems, such as proton-proton and peripheral ion-ion collisions, microscopic models for final state interactions, can produce anisotropies where the elliptic flow is negative - that is, the momentum is largest along the major axis, contrary to hydrodynamic predictions. We present results from two distinct microscopic models: one based on repulsion between string-like fields and another based on effective kinetic theory. Negative elliptic flow is a solid prediction of the string interaction model while in the model based on kinetic theory it is linked to a finite interaction range. Consequently, an experimental determination of the sign of elliptic flow, will provide novel insights into the degrees of freedom governing strong nuclear interactions in high-energy collisions and the way in which they interact.</description>

      <title>On the explosion engine of supernovae driven by a hadron-quark phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hadron-quark phase transition (PT) may trigger supernova explosions during stellar core collapse. However, both success and failure have occurred in previous attempts to explode dying stars via this mechanism. We systematically explore the outcomes of the PT-induced collapse of proto-compact stars (PCSs), with spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and a controlled series of hybrid equations of state. Our results reveal the dependence of successful and failed explosions on the PT and quark matter characteristics. A small portion ($\sim\!0.04\%\!-\!1\%$) of the released binding energy $\Delta E_B$ transforms into the diagnostic explosion energy $E_{\rm exp,diag}$, which saturates at $\sim\!6\times10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$ near the black hole formation. We draw the phase diagrams for the possible fates of supernova explosions driven by hadron-quark PTs, where the control parameters are the onset density, energy gap of the PT, and the quark matter speed of sound. Our findings can be used to guide further investigations on PT-driven core-collapse supernovae and help identify hadron-quark PT-induced PCS collapse from future observations.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with the latent heat of neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Seidov limit is a bound on the maximum latent heat that a presumed first-order phase transition of neutron-star matter can have before its excess energy density, not compensated by additional pressure, results in gravitational collapse. Because latent heat forces an apparent nonanalytic behaviour in plots correlating physical quantities (kinks in two-dimensional, ridges in three-dimensional ones), it can be constrained by data. As the onset of collapse depends on the intensity of gravity, testing for sudden derivative changes and, if they are large, breaching the Seidov limit would reward with two successive discoveries: such a phase transition (which could stem from hadron matter but also from a gravitational phase transition), and a modification of General Relativity (thus breaking the matter/gravity degeneracy). We illustrate the point with $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$ metric gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations and flavour mixing by incorporating the gravitational effects through the Dirac equation in curved spacetime inside a spherically symmetric star. We show that the flavour transition probabilities of the neutrinos depend on the interior spacetime metric as they propagate out of the star. As a consequence, we show that one could distinguish between different possible equation of states of nuclear matter even for an isolated neutron star if one could determine the flavour composition of emitted neutrinos near the stellar surface.</description>

      <title>Heavy $K^*$ mesons with open charm from $KD^{(*)}D^*$ interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the recent discovery of $T_{cc}$, which can be described as a $DD^*$ molecular state, we perform a study of the $KDD^*$ system, and its extension to studying $KD^*D^*$, where $D^*D^*$ is bound as a spin 1 $T_{cc}$-like state, to search for the possible existence of exotic mesons with the open flavors $ccs$ being part of their quark configuration. Considering the additional attractive interactions present in the $KD$ and $KD^*$ subsystems, where the states $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ are generated, we solve the Faddeev equations considering the fixed-center approximation for the mentioned three-body systems and find the existence of two doubly charmed $K^*$-like mesons, $K_{cc}^*(4309)$ and $K_{cc}^*(4449)$, with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=1/2\,(1^-)$. Considering the respective three-body thresholds of the two systems, both $K_{cc}$-states are bound by around $60$ MeV. An experimental confirmation will bring evidence for the existence of a degree of exoticity beyond charm +2.</description>

Abstract: While forming an ($A$+2) nucleus from a nucleus $A$ via a two-neutron transfer reaction, the constructive interference of the many possible reaction channels favors significant pairing enhancement through the continuum of the intermediate ($A$+1) nucleus [Phys. Lett. B \textbf{834} 137413 (2022)]. I analyse this situation in more generality, from the point of view of a varying pairing field and different continua leading to the formation of ($A$+2) nucleus. I consider $^6$He and $^{22}$C, described as housing two-neutrons in orbitals of $^5$He and $^{21}$C, respectively. The different possible situations manifest that the continuum correlations are extremely crucial to the extension of the pairing enhancement observed in the system.</description>

      <title>Use of quantality in nuclei and many-body systems</title>

Abstract: The use of quantality is discussed in the case of nuclei and other many-body systems such as atomic electrons. This dimensionless quantity is known to indicate when a many-body system behaves like a crystal or a quantum liquid. Its role is further analyzed by showing its relation to the scattering length. The emergence of a fundamental lengthscale, the limit radius, is also shown. It corresponds to the hard-core of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the case of nucleons, and to a value close to the Bohr radius in the case of atomic electrons. The occurrence of a cluster phase in nuclei is analyzed using the quantality through its relation to the localization parameter, allowing for the identification of both the number of nucleons and the density as control parameters for the occurrence of this phase. The relation of the quantality to the magnitude of the interaction also exhibits a third dimensionless parameter, monitoring the magnitude of the spin-orbit effect in finite systems, through the realization of the pseudo-spin symmetry. The impact of quantality on the spin-orbit effect is compared in various many-body systems. The role of quantality in the relative effect of the binding energy and the shell one is also analyzed in nuclei. Finally, additional dimensionless quantities are proposed from the generalization of the quantality. Nuclei are found to be exceptional systems because all their dimensionless quantities are close to the order of unity, at variance with other many-body systems.</description>

      <title>MURCA driven Bulk viscosity in neutrino trapped baryonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to $5$ nuclear saturation density and temperature upto $50$ MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of $\sim 13-50$ MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from $32-100$ milliseconds, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object's survival time in some specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Yang-Mills Vacuum Calculation in $3+1d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13042v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a novel analytic framework for \(SU(N)\) Yang-Mills theory in the four-dimensional continuum. Background and effective field theory techniques are used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic interactions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims first-order contributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at one-loop order, making possible IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the validity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of collinear factorization in the exclusive photoproduction of a $ \pi ^{0}\gamma $ pair with large invariant mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the exclusive photoproduction of a $ \pi ^{0}\gamma $ pair with large invariant mass $ M^{2}_{\gamma \pi} $, which is sensitive to the exchange of either two quarks or two gluons in the $ t $-channel. In this paper, we show that the process involving two-gluon exchanges does not factorize in the Bjorken limit at the leading twist. This can be explicitly demonstrated by the fact that there exist diagrams, which contribute at the leading twist, for which Glauber gluons are trapped, due to the pinching of the contour integration of both the plus and minus component of the Glauber gluon momentum. For the same reason, $\pi^0$-nucleon scattering to two photons also suffers from the same issue. On the other hand, we stress that there are no issues with respect to collinear factorization for the quark channels. By considering an analysis of all potential reduced diagrams of leading pinch-singular surfaces, we argue that the quark channel is safe from Glauber pinches, and therefore, a collinear factorization in that case follows through without any problems. This means that processes where gluon exchanges are forbidden, such as the exclusive photoproduction of $ \pi ^{\pm}\gamma $ and $ \rho^{0,\,\pm} \gamma $, are unaffected by the factorization breaking effects we point out in this paper.</description>

      <title>Efficient and precise quantum simulation of ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and precise framework to quantum simulate the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering. This framework employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements a compact scheme for encoding this basis upon lattice discretization. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. Our framework simulates the scattering by the efficient and precise algorithm of the truncated Taylor series. The qubit cost of our framework scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our framework advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our framework with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found. Our framework can be generalized to simulate the dynamics of various scattering problems in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Pole analysis for the $D^{*}\bar K$-$D\bar{K^*}$ coupled-channel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, possible hadronic molecules in the $D^*\bar K$-$D\bar K^*$ coupled-channel system are investigated with the one-meson exchange potentials, where both vector and pseudoscalar mesons are considered as exchange particles. We find an S-wave virtual state with mass $M=2487$ MeV, and a resonance with $M=2759$ and width $\Gamma=18$ MeV. In the $D^* \bar K$ invariant mass distribution, the virtual state appears as a cusp at the $D^*\bar K$ threshold, while the resonance potentially manifests as a dip. In particular, we take into account the $D\bar K \pi$ three-body dynamics due to the on-shell pion exchange and the finite decay width for $\bar K^*$. Additionally, the SU(4) breaking effect in the coupling between charmed and light mesons is investigated in our work. Our results also indicate that the accurate measurement for the decay width of the $D\bar K^*$ resonance can help us to evaluate this effect in the future.</description>

      <title>Predictions for photon-jet correlations at forward rapidities in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study for the first time jet-medium interactions in heavy-ion collisions with introduction of saturation and Sudakov effects with parameters tuned for upcoming forward calorimeter acceptances in experiments, in particular the ALICE FoCal detector. We focus on $\gamma +$jet correlations by taking into account in-medium parton evolution using the BDIM equation that describes jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) combined with vacuum-like emissions (VLE). We systematically introduce the early time gluon saturation dynamics through the small-$x$ Improved Transverse Momentum Dependent factorization (ITMD). For our purpose, we use Monte Carlo programs KATIE and TMDICE to generate hard events and in-medium parton evolution, respectively. We present results of azimuthal correlations and nuclear modification ratios to gauge the impact of the gluon saturation effects at early time for the in-medium jet energy loss.</description>
