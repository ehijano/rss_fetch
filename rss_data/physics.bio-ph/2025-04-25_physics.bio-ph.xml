      <title>Quantum diamond microscopy of individual vaterite microspheres containing magnetite nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biocompatible vaterite microspheres, renowned for their porous structure, are promising carriers for magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and diagnostic imaging. Precise control over the magnetic moment of individual microspheres is crucial for these applications. This study employs widefield quantum diamond microscopy to map the stray magnetic fields of individual vaterite microspheres (3-10 um) loaded with Fe3O4 MNPs of varying sizes (5 nm, 10 nm, and 20 nm). By analyzing over 35 microspheres under a 222 mT external magnetizing field, we measured peak-to-peak stray field amplitudes of 41 uT for 5 nm and 10 nm superparamagnetic MNPs, reflecting their comparable magnetic response, and 12 uT for 20 nm ferrimagnetic MNPs, due to distinct magnetization behavior. Finite-element simulations confirm variations in MNP distribution and magnetization uniformity within the vaterite matrix, with each microsphere encapsulating thousands of MNPs to generate its magnetization. This high-resolution magnetic imaging approach yields critical insights into MNP-loaded vaterite, enabling optimized synthesis and magnetically controlled systems for precision therapies and diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Probing molecular concentration in cell nuclei with Brillouin microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell volume is controlled by osmotic regulation of the fluid content, via water efflux through the cell membrane. The rate of this process is controlled by the ability of the liquid to move through the meshwork of solid elements within the cell. While such dynamics have been interpreted in the frame of the poroelastic theory in the cytoplasm, the behavior of the nucleus remains unknown due to a lack of technique to probe it. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) allows to interrogate the sound velocity and attenuation of a sample in a non-contact manner, thus revealing the dynamic response of the material. In cells, such data were initially interpreted as the viscoelastic response of the actin meshwork, but later studies pointed out the importance of water content. To resolve this lack of consensus in the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, and investigate the possible poroelastic nature of the nucleus, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that Brillouin microscopy actually provides a measure of molecular concentration in living cells</description>

      <title>The need for statistical physics in Africa: perspective and an illustration in drug delivery problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of statistical physics in Africa is in its nascent stages, yet its application holds immense promise for advancing emerging research trends on the continent. This perspective paper, a product of a two-week workshop on biophysics in Morogoro (Tanzania), aims to illuminate the potential of statistical physics in regional scientific research. We employ in-silico atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the loading and delivery capabilities of lecithin nanolipids for niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug. Our simulations reveal that the loading capacity and interaction strength between lecithin nanolipids and niclosamide improve with increased lecithin concentrations. We perform a free-energy landscape analysis which uncovers two distinct metastable conformations of niclosamide within both the aqueous phase and the lecithin nanolipids. Over a simulation period of half a microsecond, lecithin nanolipids self-assemble into a spherical monolayer structure, providing detailed atomic-level insights into their interactions with niclosamide. These findings underscore the potential of lecithin nanolipids as efficient drug delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Tension Chains and Active Force Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viewed under a fluorescence microscope, the actomyosin cytoskeleton presents vivid streaks of lines together with persistent oscillatory waves. Using an active hydrodynamic approach, we show how a uniform distribution of single or mixture of contractile stresslets spontaneously segregate, followed by the formation of singular structures of high contractility (tension chains) in finite time. Simultaneously, the collection of stresslets exhibit travelling waves and swapping as a consequence of nonreciprocity. In the finite geometry of the cell, the collection of active tension chains can form an active web held together by specific anchoring at the cell boundary. On the other hand, preferential wetting at the cell boundary can reinforce active segregation in a mixture of stresslets leading to stratification.</description>

      <title>Flow associated with Lighthill's elongated-body theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic forces acting on an undulating swimming fish consist of two components: a drag-based resistive force and a reactive force originating from the necessary acceleration of an added mass of water. Lighthill's elongated-body theory, based on potential flow, provides a framework for calculating this reactive force. By leveraging the high aspect ratio of most fish, the theory simplifies the problem into a series of independent two-dimensional slices of fluids along the fish's body, which exchange momentum with the body and neighbouring slices. Using momentum conservation arguments, Lighthill's theory predicts the total thrust generated by an undulating fish, based solely on the dimensions and kinematics of its caudal fin. However, the assumption of independent slices has led to the common misconception that the flow produced lacks a longitudinal component. In this paper, we revisit Lighthill's theory, offering a modern reinterpretation using essential singularities of potential flows. We then extend it to predict the full three-dimensional flow field induced by the fish's body motion. Our results compare favourably with numerical simulations of realistic fish geometries.</description>
