      <title>Identifying fatigue crack initiation through analytical calculation of temporal compliance calibrated with Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue failure is ubiquitous in engineering applications. While the total fatigue life is critical to understanding a component's operational life, for safety, regulatory compliance, and predictive maintenance, the characterization of initiation life is important. Traditionally, initiation life is characterized by potential drop method, acoustic emission technique, and strain-based measurements. However, the primary challenge with these methods lies in the necessity of calibration for each new material system. The difficulties become even more aggravated for additively manufactured components, where fatigue properties are reported to vary widely in the open literature. In this work, an analytical methodology is utilized to evaluate the initiation life of two different materials such as AlSi10Mg and SS316L, fabricated via laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) technique. The processing parameters are selected such that AlSi10Mg behaves like a brittle material while SS316L shows ductile behavior. A custom fatigue testing apparatus is used inside Computed Tomography (CT) for evaluating fatigue initiation. The apparatus reports load-displacement data, which is post-processed using an analytical approach to calculate the evolution of material compliance. The results indicate that crack initiation during fatigue loading is marked by a noticeable change in compliance. The analytical technique shows a maximum difference of 4.8% in predicting initiation life compared to CT imaging. These findings suggest that compliance monitoring can effectively identify fatigue initiation in various materials.</description>

      <title>Preparation and electrochemical properties of nitrogen-doped starch hard carbon anode materials for lithium-ion battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report the synthesis of hard carbon materials(CSH) made from corn starch and their application as an anode in lithium-ion batteries. The study shows that the Microstructure and electrochemical properties of CSHs are affected by nitrogen doping. It is found that nitrogen is embedded in the carbon layer with graphite nitrogen, pyridine nitrogen, and pyrrole nitrogen, so as to the surface morphology was changed and reduced the disorder of the materials. The electrochemical test results show that the introduction of nitrogen elements can increase the reversible capacity of the material, with the first discharge capacity reaching above 426.35 mAh g-1, and the rate performance also improves. When triethylenetetramine and pre-carbonized corn starch are carbonized at a mass ratio of 1:9, the obtained material has a reversible capacity of 122.04 mAh g-1 at a rate of 2 C. During the carbonization process, the nitrogen in triethylenetetramine is doped into the carbon materials, improving the electrochemical performance of the material.

      <title>A length-scale insensitive cohesive phase-field interface model: application to concurrent bulk and interface fracture simulation in Lithium-ion battery materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new cohesive phase-field (CPF) interface fracture model is proposed on the basis of the Euler-Lagrange equation of the phase-field theory and the interface fracture energy check w.r.t. that of the cohesive zone model. It employs an exponential function for the interpolation of fracture energy between the bulk phase and the interface, while the effective interface fracture energy $\tilde{G}_i$ is derived in such a way that the integrated phase-field fracture energy across the diffusive interface region remains consistent with the sharp interface fracture energy $G_i$ defined in the classical cohesive zone model. This consistency is the key to ensure that the numerical results remain insensitive to the choice of length-scale parameters, particularly the regularized interface thickness $L$ and the regularized fracture surface thickness $b$. By employing this energy consistency check, various CPF interface models in the literature are reviewed. Besides the length-scale insensitivity, the proposed CPF interface model offers further advantages. Thanks to the fact that the exponential interpolation function can be obtained conveniently from the relaxation solution of an Allen-Cahn equation, the proposed CPF model is advantageous over other models with high flexibility in handling structures containing complicated interface topology. In order to demonstrate this merit and to check the length-scale insensitivity in multiphysics context, the proposed CPF interface model is employed further to derive a thermodynamically consistent chemo-mechanical model relevant to Lithium-ion battery materials. Finite element simulation results of the concurrent bulk and interface fracture in polycrystalline electrode particles, reconstructed from images with segmented interfaces, confirm the expected computational advantages and the length-scale insensitivity in chemo-mechanical context.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Perspective on Spin-Lattice Density-Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently developed viewpoint on the fundamentals of density-functional theory for finite interacting spin-lattice systems that centers around the notion of degeneracy regions is presented. It allows for an entirely geometrical description of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and v-representability. The phenomena receive exemplification by an Anderson impurity model and other small-lattice examples. The case of adiabatic change and the time-dependent setting are examined as well.</description>

      <title>Neutron imaging of high-temperature Na-Zn Cells: implications for cell design and fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical cells employing Sodium (Na) and Zinc (Zn) electrodes and a chloride salt electrolyte have been imaged by neutron radiography during cycling. The use of such abundant raw materials confers a very low energy-normalised cost to the Na-Zn system, but its operation requires them to be entirely molten, and therefore to be operated at 600 {\deg}C. To suppress the self-discharge that results from this all-molten configuration, porous ceramic diaphragms are used to partition the electrolyte and thereby impede the movement of the Zn2+ ions responsible towards the Na electrode. Neutron images reveal large gas bubbles trapped beneath these diaphragms, formed during the cell fabrication process due to the large volume change that accompanies melting/solidifying of the electrolyte. Cycling data confirm that these bubbles interfere with cell operation by substantially increasing ohmic resistance. They indicate the need for either a new diaphragm design, or a cell fabrication process that prevents their formation in the first instance.</description>

      <title>Learning Physics-Consistent Material Behavior Without Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the mechanical behavior of materials is crucial for numerous engineering applications. The quality of these models depends directly on the accuracy of the constitutive law that defines the stress-strain relation. Discovering these constitutive material laws remains a significant challenge, in particular when only material deformation data is available. To address this challenge, unsupervised machine learning methods have been proposed. However, existing approaches have several limitations: they either fail to ensure that the learned constitutive relations are consistent with physical principles, or they rely on a predefined library of constitutive relations or manually crafted input features. These dependencies require significant expertise and specialized domain knowledge. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach called uLED, which overcomes the limitations by using the input convex neural network (ICNN) as the surrogate constitutive model. We improve the optimization strategy for training ICNN, allowing it to be trained end-to-end using direct strain invariants as input across various materials. Furthermore, we utilize the nodal force equilibrium at the internal domain as the training objective, which enables us to learn the constitutive relation solely from temporal displacement recordings. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a diverse range of material laws. We demonstrate that it is robust to a significant level of noise and that it converges to the ground truth with increasing data resolution. We also show that the model can be effectively trained using a displacement field from a subdomain of the test specimen and that the learned constitutive relation from one material sample is transferable to other samples with different geometries. The developed methodology provides an effective tool for discovering constitutive relations.</description>

      <title>Carbon Nanotubes as a Basis of Metamaterials and Nanostructures: Crafting via Design Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanotruss structures made of carbon nanotubes are investigated in two conceptual applications: either as building blocks of metamaterials or for nanostructural applications. The nanotrusses are optimized for different purposes, including various loadings, boundary conditions, parameterizations, objectives and constraints used to formulate optimization problems. The procedure relies on a recently developed framework consisting of molecular dynamics simulations, neural networks and finite elements. This framework is now used in the design optimization of nanostructures and the performances of different popular heuristic optimization methods are compared. Five applications of nanotrusses made of carbon nanotubes are analyzed in detail to investigate the mechanical behavior of such structures and the efficiency of the optimizations. Besides an introductory example, the design of an energy trapping carbon nanotube nanotruss, an auxetic nanotruss, a cantilever nanotruss and the maximization of the compressive strength of a metamaterial are presented. It is shown that the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes can indeed be exploited for the development of structures and materials with extraordinary mechanical properties. Although hampered by material and geometrical nonlinearity of the problem, most of the tested optimization methods have proven to be a good choice for the design of such materials and structures.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh Wave Suppression in Al0.6Sc0.4N-on-SiC Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the fabrication of a Hybrid SAW/BAW resonator made of a thin layer of Sc-doped AlN (AlScN) with a Sc concentration of 40 at% on a 4H-SiC substrate. A Sezawa mode, excited by a vertical electric field, exploits the d31 piezoelectric coefficient to propagate a longitudinal acoustic wave in the AlScN. The resonant frequency is determined via the pitch in the interdigitated transducer (IDT) defined by Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. The resonant mode travels in the piezoelectric layer without leaking in the substrate thanks to the mismatch in acoustic phase velocities between the piezoelectric and substrate materials. We show the impact of the piezoelectric and IDT layers' thickness on the two found modes. Importantly, we show how thin piezoelectric and electrode layers effectively suppress the Rayleigh mode. While some challenges in the deposition of AlScN remain towards a large coupling coefficient k_eff^2, We show how wave confinement in the IDT obtains a good quality factor. We also show how modifying the IDT reflectivity allows us to engineer a stopband to prevent unwanted modes from being excited between resonance and antiresonance frequencies. Finally, we validate the simulation with fabricated and measured devices and present possible improvements to this resonator architecture.</description>

      <title>An Assessment of Commonly Used Equivalent Circuit Models for Corrosion Analysis: A Bayesian Approach to Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a crucial technique for assessing corrosion of a metallic materials. The analysis of EIS hinges on the selection of an appropriate equivalent circuit model (ECM) that accurately characterizes the system under study. In this work, we systematically examined the applicability of three commonly used ECMs across several typical material degradation scenarios. By applying Bayesian Inference to simulated corrosion EIS data, we assessed the suitability of these ECMs under different corrosion conditions and identified regions where the EIS data lacks sufficient information to statistically substantiate the ECM structure. Additionally, we posit that the traditional approach to EIS analysis, which often requires measurements to very low frequencies, might not be always necessary to correctly model the appropriate ECM. Our study assesses the impact of omitting data from low to medium-frequency ranges on inference results and reveals that a significant portion of low-frequency measurements can be excluded without substantially compromising the accuracy of extracting system parameters. Further, we propose simple checks to the posterior distributions of the ECM components and posterior predictions, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate the suitability of a particular ECM and the minimum frequency required to be measured. This framework points to a pathway for expediting EIS acquisition by intelligently reducing low-frequency data collection and permitting on-the-fly EIS measurements</description>

      <title>Polarization Saturation in Multi-layered Interfacial Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) polytypes of broken inversion and mirror symmetries were recently shown to exhibit switchable electric polarization even at the ultimate two-layer thin limit. Their out-of-plane polarization was found to accumulate in a ladder-like fashion with each successive layer, offering 2D building blocks for the bottom-up construction of 3D ferroelectrics. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that beyond a critical stack thickness, the accumulated polarization in rhombohedral polytypes of molybdenum disulfide (r-MoS2) saturates. The underlying saturation mechanism, deciphered via DFT and self-consistent Poisson-Schr\"odinger calculations, point to a purely electronic redistribution involving: (1) polarization-induced bandgap closure that allows for cross-stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge; (2) reduction of the polarization saturation value, as well as the critical thickness at which it is obtained, by the presence of free carriers. The resilience of polar layered structures to atomic surface reconstruction, which is essentially unavoidable in polar 3D crystals, potentially allows for the design of new devices with mobile surface charges. Our findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.</description>

      <title>Flow-induced anisotropy in a carbon black-filled silicone elastomer: electromechanical properties and structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon black (CB)-elastomers can serve as low-cost, highly deformable sensor materials, but hardly any work exists on their structure-property relationships. We report on flow-induced anisotropy, considering CB-silicone films generated via doctor blade coating. Cured films showed slight electrical anisotropy, with conductivity parallel to the coating direction being lower than perpendicular to it. Furthermore, piezoresistive sensitivity was much larger for stretch perpendicular to the coating direction than for parallel stretch. Structural analysis for length scales up to the CB agglomerate level yielded only weak evidence of anisotropy. Based on this evidence and insight from CB network simulations, we hypothesize that shear flow during coating fragments the CB network and then induces a preferential aggregate alignment, as well as increased inter-particle distances, parallel to the coating direction. As a practical conclusion, already weak anisotropic structuration suffices to cause significant electric anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Dielectric Response due to Domain Wall Motion in Ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) is a prototypical perovskite ferroelectric, whose dielectric permittivity and loss spectra -- which are strongly temperature and frequency dependent -- include contributions from inhomogeneous polarization patterns, with polar domain walls (DWs) being the most common types. In order to elucidate how DWs influence dielectric response, we utilized a continuum approach based on the Landau-Ginzburg theory to model field-dependent properties of polydomain tetragonal phase of BTO near room temperature and above. A system with 180$^\circ$ DWs was evaluated as a case study, with both position-resolved and volume-averaged dielectric susceptibility and loss computed at different temperatures for a range of applied field frequencies and amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that cooperative dipole fluctuations in the vicinity of the DW provide a large (extrinsic) contribution to the system dielectric response relative to the intrinsic contribution stemming from within the domain. Dynamics of the DW profile fluctuations under applied field can be represented by a combination of breathing and sliding vibrational motions, with each exhibiting distinct dependence on the field frequency and amplitude. The implications of this behavior are important for understanding and improving control of coupled functional properties in ferroelectric materials, including their dielectric, electromechanical, and electrooptical responses. Furthermore, this investigation provides a computational benchmark for future studies and can be readily extended to other topological polarization patterns in ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Giant strain-induced spin splitting effect in MnTe, a $g$-wave altermagnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal MnTe is an altermagnetic semiconductor with $g$-wave symmetry of spin polarization in momentum space. In the nonrelativistic limit, this symmetry mandates that electric current flowing in any crystallographic direction is unpolarized. However, it is shown that elastic strain is effective in inducing the spin splitting effect in MnTe. For this analysis, a spin-orbit-coupled $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian for the valence band maximum at the A point is derived and fitted to eigenvalues calculated from first principles. The spin splitting angle is calculated using the Boltzmann approach in the relaxation-time approximation. The spin splitting gauge factor exceeds 20 near the valence band maximum. Thus, with suitable substrate engineering, MnTe can be used as an efficient source and detector of spin current in spintronic devices. Proper inclusion of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is crucial for the correct description of the transport properties of MnTe.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to explore the structure of boron clusters doped with two chromium atoms (B$_7$Cr$_2$). The results show that the most stable structure is a bipyramidal configuration formed by a B$_7$ ring coordinated with two metallic atoms, similar to recently reported B$_7$M$_2$ analogues.

      <title>Building spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with diaza-nanographenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and engineering the coupling of spins in nanomaterials is of central importance for designing novel devices. Graphene nanostructures with {\pi}-magnetism offer a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetic interactions. However, realizing spin chains bearing controlled odd-even effects with suitable nanographene systems is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the successful on-surface synthesis of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with parity-dependent magnetization based on antiaromatic diaza-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (diaza-HBC) units. Using distinct synthetic strategies, two types of spin chains with different terminals were synthesized, both exhibiting a robust odd-even effect on the spin coupling along the chain. Combined investigations using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, density functional theory calculations, and quantum spin models confirmed the structures of the diaza-HBC chains and revealed their magnetic properties, which has an S = 1/2 spin per unit through electron donation from the diaza-HBC core to the Au(111) substrate. Gapped excitations were observed in even-numbered chains, while enhanced Kondo resonance emerged in odd-numbered units of odd-numbered chains due to the redistribution of the unpaired spin along the chain. Our findings provide an effective strategy to construct nanographene spin chains and unveil the odd-even effect in their magnetic properties, offering potential applications in nanoscale spintronics.</description>

      <title>Elemental Reactivity Maps for Materials Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When searching for novel inorganic materials, limiting the combination of constituent elements can greatly improve the search efficiency. In this study, we used machine learning to predict elemental combinations with high reactivity for materials discovery. The essential issue for such prediction is the uncertainty of whether the unreported combinations are non-reactive or not just investigated, though the reactive combinations can be easily collected as positive datasets from the materials databases. To construct the negative datasets, we developed a process to select reliable non-reactive combinations by evaluating the similarity between unreported and reactive combinations. The machine learning models were trained by both datasets and the prediction results were visualized by two-dimensional heatmaps: elemental reactivity maps to identify elemental combinations with high reactivity but no reported stable compounds. The maps predicted high reactivity (i.e., synthesizability) for the Co_Al_Ge ternary system, and two novel ternary compounds were synthesized: Co4Ge3.19Al0.81 and Co2Al1.24Ge1.76.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric power generation has emerged as a topic of immense interest in recent years owing to the orthogonal geometry which enables better scalability and fabrication of devices. Here, we investigate the thickness dependence of longitudinal and transverse responses in film-substrate systems i.e., the Seebeck coefficient, Hall coefficient, Nernst coefficient and anomalous Nernst coefficient in a unified and general manner based on the circuit model, which describes the system as the parallel setup. By solving the parallel circuit model, we show that the transverse responses exhibit a significant peak, indicating the importance of a cooperative effect between the film and the substrate, arising from circulating currents that occur in these multilayer systems in the presence of a temperature gradient. Finally, on the basis of realistic material parameters, we predict that the Nernst effect in bismuth thin films on doped silicon substrates is boosted to unprecedented values if the thickness ratio is tuned accordingly, motivating experimental validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become indispensable for performing accurate large-scale atomistic simulations and predicting crystal structures. This study introduces the development of a polynomial MLP specifically for the ternary Cu-Ag-Au system. The MLP is formulated as a polynomial of polynomial invariants that remain unchanged under any rotation. The polynomial MLP facilitates not only comprehensive global structure searches within the Cu-Ag-Au alloy system but also reliable predictions of a wide variety of properties across the entire composition range. The developed MLP supports highly accurate and efficient atomistic simulations, thereby significantly advancing the understanding of the Cu-Ag-Au system. Furthermore, the methodology demonstrated in this study can be easily applied to other ternary alloy systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zener ordering is a phenomenon that octahedral interstitial atoms such as carbon occupy the same sublattice inside bcc matrix such as iron. The original formulation relies on a mean field theory, which is still most in use today. We employ multiple methods, such as Molecular Dynamics, Metropolis Monte Carlo, Mean Field Theory with chemical interactions and finite temperature effects to show that the Zener ordering for iron carbon systems is governed by local chemical interactions and finite temperature effects and less of mean field nature as described originally by Zener.</description>

      <title>Orientational disorder and molecular correlations in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites: From fundamental insights to technological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIP) have emerged in recent years as highly promising semiconducting materials for a wide range of optoelectronic and energy applications. Nevertheless, the rotational dynamics of the organic components and many molecule interdependencies, which may strongly impact the functional properties of HOIP, are not yet fully understood. In this study, we quantitatively analyze the orientational disorder and molecular correlations in the archetypal perovskite CH$_{3}$NH$_{3}$PbI$_{3}$ (MAPI) by performing comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations and entropy calculations. We found that, in addition to the usual vibrational and orientational contributions, rigid molecular rotations around the C-N axis and correlations between neighboring molecules noticeably contribute to the entropy increment associated with the temperature-induced order-disorder phase transition in MAPI, $\Delta S_{t}$. Molecular conformational changes are equally infrequent in the low-$T$ ordered and high-$T$ disordered phases and have a null effect on $\Delta S_{t}$. Conversely, the couplings between the angular and vibrational degrees of freedom are substantially reinforced in the high-$T$ disordered phase and significantly counteract the phase-transition entropy increase resulting from other factors. Furthermore, the tendency for neighboring molecules to be orientationally ordered is markedly local, consequently inhibiting the formation of extensive polar nanodomains both at low and high temperatures. This theoretical investigation not only advances the fundamental knowledge of HOIP but also establishes physically insightful connections with contemporary technological applications like photovoltaics and solid-state cooling.</description>

      <title>Double-side Integration of the Fluorinated Self-Assembling Monolayers for Enhanced Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traps and structural defects at the hole and electron transport interfaces of the microcrystalline absorber limits the efficiency and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to accumulation of the ionic clusters, non-radiative recombination and electrochemical corrosion. Surface engineering using self-assembled monolayers (SAM) was considered as an effective strategy for modification of charge-collection junctions. In this work, we demonstrate the first report about complex integration of a SAM for double-side passivation in p-i-n PSCs. Integrating the novel 5-(4-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)amino]phenyl)thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (FTPATC) as a fluorinated SAM at the hole-transport interface reduced potential barriers and lattice stresses in the absorber. At the electron-transport side, FTPATC interacted with the A-site cations of the perovskite molecule (Cs, formamidinium), inducing a dipole for defect compensation. Using the passivation approach with fluorinated SAM demonstrated benefits in the gain of the output performance up to 22.2%. The key-advantage of double-side passivation was confirmed by the enhanced stability under continuous light-soaking (1-sun equivalent, 65 C, ISOS-L-2), maintaining 88% of the initial performance over 1680 hours and thermal stabilization under harsh heating at 90 C.</description>

      <title>Exciton dissociation in organic solar cells: An embedded charge transfer state model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic solar cells are a promising avenue for renewable energy, and our study introduces a comprehensive model to investigate exciton dissociation processes at the donor-acceptor interface. Examining quantum efficiency and emitted phonons in the charge transfer state (CTS), we explore scenarios like variations of the environment beyond the CTS and repulsive/attractive potentials. The donor-acceptor interface significantly influences the injection process, with minimal impact from the environment beyond the CTS. Attractive potentials can create localized electron states at the interface, below the acceptor band, without necessarily hampering a good injection at higher energies. Exploring different recombination processes, including acceptor-side and donor-side recombination, presents distinct phases in the energy-injection versus recombination rate. Our study highlights the important role of the type of recombination in determining the quantum efficiency and the existence of hot or cold charge transfer states. Finally, depending on the initial energy of the electron on the donor side, three distinct injection regimes are exhibited. The present model should be helpful for optimizing organic photovoltaic cell interfaces, highlighting the critical parameter interplay for enhanced performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials with stacking van der Waals (vdW) layers that can host non-trivial band structure topology and magnetism have shown many interesting properties. Here using high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the MPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals). Our study shows that besides the known AlPd$_5$I$_2$, the -MPd$_5$- structural motif of three-layer slabs separated by two I layers can host a variety of metal elements giving arise to topological interesting features and highly tunable magnetic properties in both bulk and single layer 2D structures. Among them, TiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and a likely strong topological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top valence band, respectively, with their single layers possibly hosting quantum spin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane magneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Multi-material Classification of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for the data-driven design of materials based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other scanning probe microscopy. These tools enhance efficiency in inverse design and characterization of materials. However, limited and imbalanced experimental materials data typically available is a major challenge. Also important is the need to interpret trained models, which have typically been complex enough to be uninterpretable by humans. Here, we present a systemic evaluation of transfer learning strategies to accommodate low-data scenarios in materials synthesis and a model latent feature analysis to draw connections to the human-interpretable characteristics of the samples. Our models show accurate predictions in five classes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and Mo-WSe$_2$) with up to 89$\%$ accuracy on held-out test samples. Analysis of the latent features reveals a correlation with physical characteristics such as grain density, DoG blob, and local variation. The transfer learning optimization modality and the exploration of the correlation between the latent and physical features provide important frameworks that can be applied to other classes of materials beyond TMDs to enhance the models' performance and explainability which can accelerate the inverse design of materials for technological applications.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty-aware Deep Learning Framework-based Robust Design Optimization of Metamaterial Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials represent an innovative class of artificial structures, distinguished by their extraordinary mechanical characteristics, which are beyond the scope of traditional natural materials. The use of deep generative models has become increasingly popular in the design of metamaterial units. The effectiveness of using deep generative models lies in their capacity to compress complex input data into a simplified, lower-dimensional latent space, while also enabling the creation of novel optimal designs through sampling within this space. However, the design process does not take into account the effect of model uncertainty due to data sparsity or the effect of input data uncertainty due to inherent randomness in the data. This might lead to the generation of undesirable structures with high sensitivity to the uncertainties in the system. To address this issue, a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework-based robust design approach is proposed for the design of metamaterial units with optimal target properties. The proposed approach utilizes the probabilistic nature of the deep learning framework and quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties associated with surrogate-based design optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed design approach is capable of designing high-performance metamaterial units with high reliability. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed design approach, a single-objective design optimization problem and a multi-objective design optimization problem are presented. The optimal robust designs obtained are validated by comparing them to the designs obtained from the topology optimization method as well as the designs obtained from a deterministic deep learning framework-based design optimization where none of the uncertainties in the system are explicitly considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The checkerboard lattice is a two-dimensional non-trivial structure usually seen as a planar version of the pyrochlore lattice. This geometry supports a two-band insulating electronic system with Chern topology induced by a complex hoppping parameter. Inspired by the recent advances in the topology of non-Hermitian systems, in this work we study a non-Hermitian version of the topological checkerboard lattice. The complex band structure and Berry curvature are calculated. In the insulating phase, the Chern number is the same as in the Hermitian version, but the Hall conductivity is no longer quantized. The dependence of the Hall conductivity with the non-Hermitian parameters is investigated. The non-Hermiticity can be seen as a result of dissipation caused by coupling the system to the environment, so this study casts light on the topology of open systems in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body methods provide a systematic route to computing electronic properties of molecules and materials, but high computational costs restrict their use in large-scale applications. Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework targeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of electronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering deep physical insights into electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We demonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical species, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in bond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks. This work opens up new opportunities for utilizing machine learning to solve many-electron problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer NiI$_2$ garners large research interest due to its multiferroic behavior stemming from the interplay between its non-collinear magnetic order and the spin-orbit coupling. This prompts an investigation into the stability of the magnetic order in NiI$_2$ and similar materials under external stimuli. In this work, we report the effect of biaxial and uniaxial strain on the magnetic ground state, the critical temperature, and the magnonic properties of the NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br, Cl) monolayers. For all three materials, we reveal intricate strain-dependent phase diagrams, including ferromagnetic, helimagnetic, and skyrmionic phases. Moreover, we discuss the necessity of considering the biquadratic exchange interaction in the latter analysis. We reveal that the biquadratic exchange significantly alters both the magnetic ground state and the critical temperature of the magnetic order, and we demonstrate that its importance becomes even more explicit when monolayer Ni-dihalides are strained. Finally, we calculate the magnonic dispersion for the predicted magnetic states, showing that the skyrmionic phase functions as a magnonic crystal, and demonstrate the presence of strain-tunable soft magnon modes at finite wavevectors in the helimagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ordering of the Mo$_3$O$_8$-type cluster Mott insulator Na$_3$Sc$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ with spin-1/2 triangular lattice prepared via optimal synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail the optimized synthesis of the Mo$_3$O$_8$-type cluster Mott insulator (CMI) Na$_3$Sc$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, which has been considered a candidate for realizing the spin liquid ground state. The optimized Na$_3$Sc$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, characterized by x-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and magnetic and heat capacity measurements, exhibited an effective magnetic moment close to the ideal 1.73 $\mu_{\mathrm B}$ for $S = 1/2$ spin and magnetic ordering at $\sim$ 5 K. These observations categorize Na$_3$Sc$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ as the second Mo$_3$O$_8$-type CMI to achieve a magnetic ground state, following Li$_2$InMo$_3$O$_8$. They highlight the stabilization of the magnetic ground state over the theoretically anticipated quantum spin liquid state through precise valence and chemical disorder tuning. Our findings challenge the existing theory that the magnetic ground state of Mo$_3$O$_8$-type CMIs is determined by the breathing parameter, instead showing that magnetic order is suppressed by spin defects. This study underscores the crucial role of chemical precision in investigating quantum magnetism. It suggests that precise tuning of valence states could induce magnetic ordering in previously nonmagnetic Mo$_3$O$_8$-type CMIs. Additionally, the negative findings regarding the existence of quantum spin liquids highlight the need for applied research and a reevaluation of our fundamental understanding of electronic states from both theoretical and experimental aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a systematic approach to construct superconducting order parameters based on the spin space group. Compared to magnetic space groups where spatial and spin rotation of elements are completely locked, the superconducting channels and the forms of basis functions in spin space groups can be different. Furthermore, we utilize the obtained basis functions to construct the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and show the possible superconducting ground states. By virtue of those results, we discuss the application of our theory to realistic systems. Our work provides a rigorous description of superconducting gap functions in the case of spin space group, and enables further study of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Detecting winding and Chern numbers in topological matter using spectral function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to directly probe bulk topological quantum numbers in topological matter by measuring the momentum-space single-particle spectral function (SPSF). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can detect SPSF and is often used to determine the bulk band structure of quantum materials. Here, we show that while one part of the momentum-space SPSF gives band structure, it also contains the knowledge of winding and Chern numbers of various topological materials. For this, we derive SPSF in three different models of topological systems, such as the Kitaev model of topological superconductors, the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and explain how to extract the winding or Chern numbers in different topological phases from the SPSF. Such information from SPSF seems experimentally accessible due to the recent advancement of ARPES and scanning tunneling spectroscopy techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure Au and Ag atomic-size contacts in magnetic fields, from zero field to 20 T. We find a magnetic field induced torque which leads to atomic binding at shorter distances than at zero field. Furthermore, the conductance drops below $G_0$ at high magnetic fields by about 15\% in Au. We calculate the conduction through nanosized Au contacts containing residual $O_2$ molecules attached to the contact region and find a spin polarized current when $O_2$ is located at the atomic contact. We discuss the role of spin-orbit coupling in the magnetic properties of $O_2$ attached to Au.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Two-dimensional Weyl Fermions in Air-Stable Monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weyl semimetals represent a distinct category of topological materials wherein the low-energy excitations appear as the long-sought Weyl fermions. Exotic transport and optical properties are expected because of the chiral anomaly and linear energy-momentum dispersion. While three-dimensional Weyl semimetals have been successfully realized, the quest for their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts is ongoing. Here, we report the realization of 2D Weyl fermions in monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$, which has strong spin-orbit coupling and lacks inversion symmetry, by combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, second harmonic generation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and first-principles calculations. The giant Rashba splitting and band inversion lead to the emergence of three pairs of critical Weyl cones. Moreover, monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$ exhibits excellent chemical stability in ambient conditions, which is critical for future device applications. The discovery of 2D Weyl fermions in monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$ opens up new possibilities for designing and fabricating novel spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements ("soft spots"). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible, and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>BMach: a Bayesian machine for optimizing Hubbard U parameters in DFT+U with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the effective Hubbard parameter $(U_{eff})$ in Density Functional Theory plus U (DFT+U) remains a significant challenge, often relying on empirical methods or linear response theory, which frequently fail to predict accurate material properties. This study introduces BMach, an advanced Bayesian optimization algorithm that refines $U_{eff}$ by incorporating electronic properties, such as band gaps and eigenvalues, alongside structural properties like lattice parameters. Implemented within the Quantum Espresso platform, BMach demonstrates superior accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods. The BMach-optimized $U_{eff}$ values yield electronic properties that align closely with experimental and high-level theoretical results, providing a robust framework for high-throughput materials discovery and detailed electronic property characterization across diverse material systems.</description>

Abstract: Freestanding ferroelectric oxide membranes emerge as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between topological polar ordering and dipolar interactions that are continuously tunable by strain. Our investigations combining density functional theory (DFT) and deep-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that DFT-predicted strain-driven morphotropic phase boundary involving monoclinic phases manifest as diverse domain structures at room temperatures, featuring continuous distributions of dipole orientations and mobile domain walls. Detailed analysis of dynamic structures reveals that the enhanced piezoelectric response observed in stretched PbTiO$_3$ membranes results from small-angle rotations of dipoles at domain walls, distinct from conventional polarization rotation mechanism and adaptive phase theory inferred from static structures. We identify a ferroelectric topological structure, termed "dipole spiral," which exhibits a giant intrinsic piezoelectric response ($&gt;$320 pC/N). This helical structure, possessing a rotational zero-energy mode, unlocks new possibilities for exploring chiral phonon dynamics and dipolar Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interactions.</description>

Abstract: The rapid development of brain-inspired computing requires new artificial components and architectures for its hardware implementation. In this regard, memristive devices emerged as potential candidates for artificial synapses because of their ability to emulate the plasticity of the biological synapses. In this work, the synaptic behavior of the TiN/La2NiO4+{\delta}/Pt memristive devices based on thermally annealed La2NiO4+{\delta} films is thoroughly investigated. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy, we show that annealing using reducing (Ar) or oxidizing (O2) atmospheres affects the interstitial oxygen content ({\delta}) in the La2NiO4+{\delta} films. Electrical characterization shows that both devices exhibit long-term potentiation/depression and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which makes them suitable for neuromorphic applications. At the same time, the Ar annealed TiN/La2NiO4+{\delta}/Pt device demonstrates non-volatile properties with low energy consumption during the learning process. On the other hand, in the O2 annealed TiN/La2NiO4+{\delta}/Pt device the resistive switching behavior is more volatile and requires more energy for synaptic learning. Finally, the simulation tools show that spiking neural network architectures with unsupervised learning rules based on the experimental data achieve high inference accuracy in the digit recognition task, which proves the potential of TiN/La2NiO4+{\delta}/Pt devices for artificial synapse applications.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle band structure and excitonic optical response in V2O5 bulk and monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of V$_2$O$_5$ is calculated using an all-electron quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ method, including electron-hole ladder diagrams in the screening of $W$. The optical dielectric function calculated with the Bethe-Salpeter equation exhibits excitons with large binding energy, consistent with spectroscopic ellipsometry data and other recent calculations. Sharp peaks in the direction perpendicular to the layers at high energy are found to be an artifact of the truncation of the numbers of bands included in the BSE calculation of the macroscopic dielectric function. The $\varepsilon_1(\omega=0)$ gives indices of refraction in good agreement with experiment. The excitons are charge transfer excitons with the hole primarily on oxygen and electrons on vanadium, but depending on which exciton, the distribution over different oxygens changes. The exciton wave functions have a spread of about 5-15\AA, with asymmetric character for the electron distribution around the hole depending on which oxygen the hole is fixed at. The monolayer quasiparticle gap increases inversely proportional to interlayer distance once the initial interlayer covalent couplings are removed which is thanks to the long-range nature of the self-energy and the reduced screening in a 2D system. The optical gap on the other hand is relatively independent of interlayer spacing because of the compensation between the self-energy gap shift and the exciton binding energy, both of which are proportional to the screened Coulomb interaction $\hat{W}$. Recent experimental results on very thin layer V$_2$O$_5$ obtained by chemical exfoliation provide experimental support for an increase in gap.</description>

      <title>Suppression of shear ionic motions in bismuth by coupling with large-amplitude internal displacement</title>

Abstract: Bismuth, with its rhombohedral crystalline structure and two Raman active phonon modes corresponding to the internal displacement ($A_{1g}$) and shear ($E_{g}$) ionic motions, offers an ideal target for the investigation of the phonon-phonon and electron-phonon couplings under photoexcitation. We perform transient reflectivity measurements of bismuth single crystal at 11 K over wide range of absorbed laser fluence up to $F_\text{abs}=9$ mJ/cm$^2$, at which a sign of an irreversible surface damage is observed. At the minimum fluence examined (0.1 mJ/cm$^2$) the coherent $A_{1g}$ and $E_g$ oscillations are a cosine and a sine functions of time, as are consistent with their generations in the displacive and impulsive limits, respectively. With increasing fluence the initial phases of the both modes deviate from their low-fluence values, indicating a finite time required for the transition from the ground-state potential energy surface (PES) to the excited-state one. Surprisingly, the $E_g$ amplitude increases with increasing fluence up to 3 mJ/cm$^2$ and then turns to an apparent decrease, in contrast to the monotonic increase of the $A_{1g}$ amplitude up to 6 mJ/cm$^2$. The contrasted behaviors can be understood by considering a two-dimensional PES, where the strongly driven $A_{1g}$ oscillation leads to a temporal fluctuation of the PES along the $E_g$ coordinate and thereby to a loss in the $E_g$ oscillation coherence at high fluences.</description>

      <title>Work Function Dependent Reduction of Transition Metal Nitrides (TMNs) in Hydrogen Environments</title>

Abstract: Amidst the growing importance of hydrogen in a sustainable future, it is crucial to develop coatings that can protect hydrogen-sensitive system components in reactive hydrogen environments. However, the prediction of the chemical stability of materials in hydrogen is not fully understood. In this study, we show that the work function is a key parameter determining the reducibility (i.e., de-nitridation) of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) in hydrogen radicals (H*) at elevated temperatures. We demonstrate that when the work function of a TMN system drops below a threshold limit, its reduction effectively stops. We propose that this is due to the preferential binding of H* to TM-atoms rather than N-atoms, which makes the formation of volatile species (NHx) unfavourable. This finding provides a novel perspective for comprehending the interaction of hydrogen with transition metal compounds and allows predicting the chemical stability of hydrogen-protective coatings.</description>

Abstract: The development of interatomic potentials that can accurately capture a wide range of physical phenomena and diverse environments is of significant interest, but it presents a formidable challenge. This challenge arises from the numerous structural forms, multiple phases, complex intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, and varying external conditions. In this paper, we present a method to construct environment-adaptive interatomic potentials by adapting to the local atomic environment of each atom within a system. The collection of atomic environments of interest is partitioned into several clusters of atomic environments. Each cluster represents a distinctive local environment and is used to define a corresponding local potential. We introduce a many-body many-potential expansion to smoothly blend these local potentials to ensure global continuity of the potential energy surface. This is achieved by computing the probability functions that determine the likelihood of an atom belonging to each cluster. We apply the environment-adaptive machine learning potentials to predict observable properties for Ta element and InP compound, and compare them with density functional theory calculations.</description>

Abstract: Wurtzite-type ferroelectrics are highly promising for next-generation microelectronic devices due to their ferroelectric properties and integration with exiting semiconductors. However, their high coercive fields, which are close to breakdown electric fields, need to be lowered. To deal with this issue and secure device reliability, much effort has been devoted to exploring novel wurtzite compounds with lower polarization switching barriers and implementing doping strategies. Here, we report first-principles calculations on polarization switching in cation-vacancy ordered wurtzite {\alpha}-Al2S3, unveiling its uniaxial quadruple-well ferroelectricity and moderate switching barrier, 51 meV/cation, which is much lower than that of conventional wurtzite ferroelectrics. There are three important features relevant to the Al vacancies leading to the uncommon quadruple-well ferroelectricity and the moderate switching barrier: mitigation of cation-cation repulsion, structural flexibility that alleviates an in-plane lattice expansion, and formation of {\sigma}-like bonding states consisting of Al 3pz and S 3pz orbitals. Biaxial compressive strain and Ga doping lower the switching barriers by up to 40%. This study encourages experimental investigation of the ferroelectric properties for defective wurtzite {\alpha}-Al2S3 as a new promising material with unconventional and intriguing ferroelectricity and suggests a potential strategy for reducing switching barriers in wurtzite ferroelectrics: introducing cation vacancies.</description>

      <title>Considerations for extracting moir\'e-level strain from dark field intensities in transmission electron microscopy</title>

Abstract: Bragg interferometry (BI) is an imaging technique based on four-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (4D-STEM) wherein the intensities of select overlapping Bragg disks are fit or more qualitatively analyzed in the context of simple trigonometric equations to determine local stacking order. In 4D-STEM based approaches, the collection of full diffraction patterns at each real-space position of the scanning probe allows the use of precise virtual apertures much smaller and more variable in shape than those used in conventional dark field imaging, such that even buried interfaces marginally twisted from other layers can be targeted. A coarse-grained form of dark field ptychography, BI uses simple physically derived fitting functions to extract the average structure within the illumination region and is therefore viable over large fields of view. BI has shown a particular advantage for selectively investigating the interlayer stacking and associated moir\'e reconstruction of bilayer interfaces within complex multi-layered structures. This has enabled investigation of reconstruction and substrate effects in bilayers through encapsulating hexagonal boron nitride and of select bilayer interfaces within trilayer stacks. However, the technique can be improved to provide a greater spatial resolution and probe a wider range of twisted structures, for which current limitations on acquisition parameters can lead to large illumination regions and the computationally involved post-processing can fail. Here we analyze these limitations and the computational processing in greater depth, presenting a few methods for improvement over previous works, discussing potential areas for further expansion, and illustrating the current capabilities of this approach for extracting moir\'e-scale strain.</description>

      <title>A hybrid FEM-NN optimization method to learn the physics-constrained constitutive relations from full-field data</title>

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities of representing high-dimensional, complex functional relations, and hence have been widely used to characterize complex constitutive relations for various types of materials, such as polycrystals, polymers, etc. However, to construct a reliable NN-based constitutive model, a considerable amount of data, i.e. stress-strain states along different loading paths is needed, which can be expensive to collect. To address such challenge, we develop a hybrid finite element method (FEM) - NN optimization framework to learn complex hyperelastic constitutive relations from full-field data. The key advantage of this framework is that it can make use of the non-uniform displacement field due to the geometric inhomogeneities for training NN-based constitutive models. Since such data can provide many different stress-strain states in a single test, it can greatly reduce the number of experiments needed for the training of NNs. Besides, we adopt a mechanics-informed neural network (MINN) as our architecture to ensure that our NN-based models satisfy all necessary physical constraints by construction, such as objectivity, material symmetry, polyconvexity, etc. Such architecture is also key to the convergence of our optimization framework. We then use both synthetic and experimental data to test the performance of our proposed framework on various isotropic hyperelastic materials. Results show that our optimization framework can be used to train NN-based constitutive models for hyperelastic materials with high accuracy and efficiency using data generated from simple tests, which can also be easily adapted to characterize complex constitutive models for a broader range of materials.</description>

      <title>Accurate Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients and their Uncertainties from Computer Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-diffusion coefficients, $D^*$, are routinely estimated from molecular dynamics simulations by fitting a linear model to the observed mean-squared displacements (MSDs) of mobile species. MSDs derived from simulation suffer from statistical noise, which introduces uncertainty in the resulting estimate of $D^*$. An optimal scheme for estimating $D^*$ will minimise this uncertainty, i.e., will have high statistical efficiency, and will give an accurate estimate of the uncertainty itself. We present a scheme for estimating $D^*$ from a single simulation trajectory with high statistical efficiency and accurately estimating the uncertainty in the predicted value. The statistical distribution of MSDs observable from a given simulation is modelled as a multivariate normal distribution using an analytical covariance matrix for an equivalent system of freely diffusing particles, which we parameterise from the available simulation data. We then perform Bayesian regression to sample the distribution of linear models that are compatible with this model multivariate normal distribution, to obtain a statistically efficient estimate of $D^*$ and an accurate estimate of the associated statistical uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: In sufficiently clean materials where electron-electron interactions are strong compared to momentum-relaxing scattering processes, electron transport resembles the flow of a viscous fluid. We study hydrodynamic electron transport across density interfaces (n-n junctions) in a 2DEG in the Corbino geometry. From numerical simulations in COMSOL using realistic parameters, we show that we can produce tunable viscous layers at the density interface by varying the density ratio of charge carriers. We quantitatively explain this observation with simple analytic expressions together with boundary conditions at the interface. We also show signatures of these viscous layers in the magnetoresistance. Breaking down viscous and ohmic contributions, we find that when outer radial region of the Corbino has higher charge density compared to the inner region, the viscous layers at the interface serve to suppress the magneto-resistance produced by momentum-relaxing scattering. Conversely, the magneto-resistance is enhanced when the inner region has higher density than the outer. Our results add to the repertoire of techniques for engineering viscous electron flows, which hold a promise for applications in future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-GPU RI-HF Energies and Analytic Gradients $-$ Towards High Throughput Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an optimized algorithm and implementation for calculating resolution-of-the-identity Hartree-Fock (RI-HF) energies and analytic gradients using multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The algorithm is especially designed for high throughput \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations of small and medium size molecules (10-100 atoms). Key innovations of this work include the exploitation of multi-GPU parallelism and a workload balancing scheme that efficiently distributes computational tasks among GPUs. Our implementation also employs techniques for symmetry utilization, integral screening and leveraging sparsity to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. Computational results show that the implementation achieves significant performance improvements, including over $3\times$ speedups in single GPU AIMD throughput compared to previous GPU-accelerated RI-HF and traditional HF methods. Furthermore, utilizing multiple GPUs can provide super-linear speedup when the additional aggregate GPU memory allows for the storage of decompressed three-center integrals. Additionally, we report strong scaling efficiencies for systems up to 1000 basis functions and demonstrate practical applications through extensive performance benchmarks on up to quadruple-$\zeta$ primary basis sets, achieving floating-point performance of up to 47\% of the theoretical peak on a 4$\times$A100 GPU node.</description>
