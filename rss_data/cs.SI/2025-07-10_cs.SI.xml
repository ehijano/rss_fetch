      <title>Temporal Motif Participation Profiles for Analyzing Node Similarity in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal networks consisting of timestamped interactions between a set of nodes provide a useful representation for analyzing complex networked systems that evolve over time. Beyond pairwise interactions between nodes, temporal motifs capture patterns of higher-order interactions such as directed triangles over short time periods. We propose temporal motif participation profiles (TMPPs) to capture the behavior of nodes in temporal motifs. Two nodes with similar TMPPs take similar positions within temporal motifs, possibly with different nodes. TMPPs serve as unsupervised embeddings for nodes in temporal networks that are directly interpretable, as each entry denotes the frequency at which a node participates in a particular position in a specific temporal motif. We demonstrate that clustering TMPPs reveals groups of nodes with similar roles in a temporal network through simulation experiments and a case study on a network of militarized interstate disputes.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Fake Account Detection: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing effort to develop effective and efficient algorithms for fake account detection in online social networks. This survey comprehensively reviews existing methods, with a focus on graph-based techniques that utilise topological features of social graphs (in addition to account information, such as their shared contents and profile data) to distinguish between fake and real accounts. We provide several categorisations of these methods (for example, based on techniques used, input data, and detection time), discuss their strengths and limitations, and explain how these methods connect in the broader context. We also investigate the available datasets, including both real-world data and synthesised models. We conclude the paper by proposing several potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Modeling Heterogeneity across Varying Spatial Extents: Discovering Linkages between Sea Ice Retreat and Ice Shelve Melt in the Antarctic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial phenomena often exhibit heterogeneity across spatial extents and in proximity, making them complex to model-especially in dynamic regions like ice shelves and sea ice. In this study, we address this challenge by exploring the linkages between sea ice retreat and Antarctic ice shelf (AIS) melt. Although atmospheric forcing and basal melting have been widely studied, the direct impact of sea ice retreat on AIS mass loss remains underexplored. Traditional models treat sea ice and AIS as separate systems. It limits their ability to capture localized linkages and cascading feedback. To overcome this, we propose Spatial-Link, a novel graph-based framework that quantifies spatial heterogeneity to capture linkages between sea ice retreat and AIS melt. Our method constructs a spatial graph using Delaunay triangulation of satellite-derived ice change matrices, where nodes represent regions of significant change and edges encode proximity and directional consistency. We extract and statistically validate linkage paths using breadth-first search and Monte Carlo simulations. Results reveal non-local, spatially heterogeneous coupling patterns, suggesting sea ice loss can initiate or amplify downstream AIS melt. Our analysis shows how sea ice retreat evolves over an oceanic grid and progresses toward ice shelves-establishing a direct linkage. To our knowledge, this is the first proposed methodology linking sea ice retreat to AIS melt. Spatial-Link offers a scalable, data-driven tool to improve sea-level rise projections and inform climate adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Message Imbalance in Fraud Detection with Dual-View Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation, we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate Message imbalance in Fraud Detection(MimbFD). Specifically, we design a topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust node representations, enhancing the stable association between node representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes. Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud detection.</description>

      <title>Towards Designing Social Interventions for Online Climate Change Denialism Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As conspiracy theories gain traction, it has become crucial to research effective intervention strategies that can foster evidence and science-based discussions in conspiracy theory communities online. This study presents a novel framework using insider language to contest conspiracy theory ideology in climate change denialism on Reddit. Focusing on discussions in two Reddit communities, our research investigates reactions to pro-social and evidence-based intervention messages for two cohorts of users: climate change deniers and climate change supporters. Specifically, we combine manual and generative AI-based methods to craft intervention messages and deploy the interventions as replies on Reddit posts and comments through transparently labeled bot accounts. On the one hand, we find that evidence-based interventions with neutral language foster positive engagement, encouraging open discussions among believers of climate change denialism. On the other, climate change supporters respond positively, actively participating and presenting additional evidence. Our study contributes valuable insights into the process and challenges of automatically delivering interventions in conspiracy theory communities on social media, and helps inform future research on social media interventions.</description>

      <title>DICE: Data Influence Cascade in Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning offers a promising approach to crowdsource data consumptions and computational workloads across geographically distributed compute interconnected through peer-to-peer networks, accommodating the exponentially increasing demands. However, proper incentives are still in absence, considerably discouraging participation. Our vision is that a fair incentive mechanism relies on fair attribution of contributions to participating nodes, which faces non-trivial challenges arising from the localized connections making influence ``cascade'' in a decentralized network. To overcome this, we design the first method to estimate \textbf{D}ata \textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{C}ascad\textbf{E} (DICE) in a decentralized environment. Theoretically, the framework derives tractable approximations of influence cascade over arbitrary neighbor hops, suggesting the influence cascade is determined by an interplay of data, communication topology, and the curvature of loss landscape. DICE also lays the foundations for applications including selecting suitable collaborators and identifying malicious behaviors.

      <title>5C Prompt Contracts: A Minimalist, Creative-Friendly, Token-Efficient Design Framework for Individual and SME LLM Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The progression from traditional prompt engineering to a more rigorous discipline of prompt design marks a pivotal shift in human-LLM interaction. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in mission-critical applications, there emerges a pressing need for frameworks that are not only explicit and systematic but also minimal enough to remain practical and broadly accessible. While many existing approaches address prompt structuring through elaborate Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) or multi-layered templates, such methods can impose significant token and cognitive overhead, potentially constraining the model's creative capacity. In this context, we propose the 5C Prompt Contract, a framework that distills prompt design into five intuitive components: Character, Cause, Constraint, Contingency, and Calibration. This minimal cognitive schema explicitly integrates fallback and output optimization directives, fostering reliable, interpretable, and creatively flexible AI interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that the 5C framework consistently achieves superior input token efficiency while maintaining rich and consistent outputs across diverse LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and Gemini), making it particularly suited for individuals and Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited AI engineering resources.</description>

      <title>Exploring Public Perceptions of Generative AI in Libraries: A Social Media Analysis of X Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates public perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in libraries through a large-scale analysis of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Using a mixed-method approach that combines temporal trend analysis, sentiment classification, and social network analysis, this paper explores how public discourse around GenAI and libraries has evolved over time, the emotional tones that dominate the conversation, and the key users or organizations driving engagement. The findings reveal that discussions are predominantly negative in tone, with surges linked to concerns about ethics and intellectual property. Furthermore, social network analysis identifies both institutional authority and individual bridge users who facilitate cross-domain engagement. The results in this paper contribute to the growing body of literature on GenAI in the library and GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sectors and offer a real-time, public-facing perspective on the emerging opportunities and concerns GenAI presents.</description>

      <title>Towards Collaborative Anti-Money Laundering Among Financial Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Money laundering is the process that intends to legalize the income derived from illicit activities, thus facilitating their entry into the monetary flow of the economy without jeopardizing their source. It is crucial to identify such activities accurately and reliably in order to enforce anti-money laundering (AML). Despite considerable efforts to AML, a large number of such activities still go undetected. Rule-based methods were first introduced and are still widely used in current detection systems. With the rise of machine learning, graph-based learning methods have gained prominence in detecting illicit accounts through the analysis of money transfer graphs. Nevertheless, these methods generally assume that the transaction graph is centralized, whereas in practice, money laundering activities usually span multiple financial institutions. Due to regulatory, legal, commercial, and customer privacy concerns, institutions tend not to share data, restricting their utility in practical usage. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that supports performing AML over multiple institutions while protecting the security and privacy of local data. To evaluate, we construct Alipay-ECB, a real-world dataset comprising digital transactions from Alipay, the world's largest mobile payment platform, alongside transactions from E-Commerce Bank (ECB). The dataset includes over 200 million accounts and 300 million transactions, covering both intra-institution transactions and those between Alipay and ECB. This makes it the largest real-world transaction graph available for analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively identify cross-institution money laundering subgroups. Additionally, experiments on synthetic datasets also demonstrate that our method is efficient, requiring only a few minutes on datasets with millions of transactions.</description>

      <title>Representative Ranking for Deliberation in the Public Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online comment sections, such as those on news sites or social media, have the potential to foster informal public deliberation, However, this potential is often undermined by the frequency of toxic or low-quality exchanges that occur in these settings. To combat this, platforms increasingly leverage algorithmic ranking to facilitate higher-quality discussions, e.g., by using civility classifiers or forms of prosocial ranking. Yet, these interventions may also inadvertently reduce the visibility of legitimate viewpoints, undermining another key aspect of deliberation: representation of diverse views. We seek to remedy this problem by introducing guarantees of representation into these methods. In particular, we adopt the notion of justified representation (JR) from the social choice literature and incorporate a JR constraint into the comment ranking setting. We find that enforcing JR leads to greater inclusion of diverse viewpoints while still being compatible with optimizing for user engagement or other measures of conversational quality.</description>

      <title>Displacement and disconnection: the impact of violence on migration networks and highway traffic in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine how violence affects migration flows and, crucially, how it reshapes the strength of migration networks -- measured by the intensity of migration between areas, accounting for the fact that some routes become more prominent or fade over time -- an aspect traditional studies overlook. Using a novel network algorithm and Mexican census data from 2005 to 2020, we first quantify changes in the strength of domestic and international migration networks across all Mexican municipalities. We exploit variation in local homicide rates, using exogenous fuel price increases and municipalities' proximity to oil pipelines as instruments, to estimate the causal impact of violence on migration. During our study period, following intensified government crackdowns on drug trafficking organizations, many criminal groups fragmented and turned toward large-scale oil theft, driving sharp increases in violence in areas with oil pipelines, particularly when fuel prices rose. The findings show that rising violence increased emigration flows, predominantly within Mexico, and strengthened the intensity of emigration networks both domestically and toward the United States. Although violent municipalities continued to receive new residents, the rise in emigration was larger. Increasing homicide rates led to at least an additional 1.12 million people emigrating domestically and 50,200 fewer Mexicans returning from the United States. Violence also eroded regional connectivity, causing a long-term decline in daily vehicle traffic on highways linking violent areas to the rest of the country.</description>
