      <title>Revisiting the missing mass problem in MOND for nearby galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z &lt; 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cosmological Tensions with Hubble Parameter Tomography via Linear Cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the persistence of various tensions in the "Cosmic Concordance" -- such as the "Hubble Tension", and the possible departure from LambdaCDM time evolution -- seen when combining complementary data sets (CMB studies, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, etc.), it remains an ongoing possibility for these to have a real cosmological origin. If one assumes such deviations to be real, a model-independent formalism (cosmography) is useful for locating the source of the problem with concordance cosmology. The extraordinarily good fit of LambdaCDM to the CMB data shows that it was a successful model of the universe at high redshift. Yet at lower redshift -- when the dark energy density becomes significant, and its precise physical nature becomes important -- the universe may have gone off the track of simple LambdaCDM. Here we use linear cosmography fits to binned Supernova data to reconstruct the detailed temporal history of the Hubble parameter, thus probing for interesting time-dependent behaviors of the expansion rate during and after the onset of cosmic acceleration. Using combined Type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year data release and the Union2.1 compilation, we find intriguing hints of an oscillatory pattern in the Hubble parameter during the acceleration era. While these hints are low-significance, and not robust under different redshift binnings, we present this work as a proof-of-concept demonstration of this method for reconstructing the Hubble parameter evolution, which may be useful for the voluminous Supernova data sets anticipated to become available during the next few years.</description>

      <title>Consistency of standard cosmologies using Bayesian model comparison and tension quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified Bayesian assessment of model comparison and data-set consistency for LCDM (cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant) and minimal extensions (neutrino mass, spatial curvature, constant or evolving dark energy) using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and type Ia supernova (SN) data. The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\ell$ versus high-$\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\,\sigma$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $\tau$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Zoom Simulations of structure formation beyond standard cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) A thorough interpretation of the current and upcoming generation of cosmological observations requires unprecedented large-scale, high-resolution simulations spanning multiple cosmological models and parameters. The realization of these computationally demanding simulations poses a crucial technical challenge. We present beyond - $\Lambda$CDM implementations of the Dynamic Zoom Simulations (DZS) method, a performance-enhancing technique tailored for large-scale simulations that produce lightcone-like outputs. This approach dynamically decreases the resolution of a simulation in the regions that are not in causal connection with the observer, saving computational resources without directly affecting the physical properties within the lightcone. We implemented the DZS algorithm in two state-of-the-art codes supporting non-standard cosmologies, namely modified $f(R)$ gravity in Arepo and dark sector interactions in Gadget4. We analyzed result accuracy and performance gains across resolution, simulation volume and model by comparing runs performed with and without the DZS algorithm. Our DZS reproduce the lightcone halo mass function, sky-projected massmaps, and matter and weak lensing convergence power spectra with an accuracy of $\simeq$ 0.1% or higher in most cases. In terms of performance, DZS runs in our test simulations can save up to $\sim$ 50% runtime compared to the non-DZS counterparts. A scaling to larger simulated volumes suggests that performance gains could improve by an additional $\sim$ 20% at the resolution levels of current state-of-the-art simulations. The validation of the DZS algorithm in non-standard models demonstrates that this technique can enable cost effective, large-scale ($\gtrsim$ 1 cGpc/h) simulations with state-of-the-art resolution, providing the computational framework needed to constrain and help the interpretation of forthcoming data.</description>

      <title>On the Difficulties with Late-Time Solutions for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the notion that cosmological models that modify the late-time expansion history cannot simultaneously fit the SH0ES collaboration's measurements of the Hubble constant, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations data, and Type Ia supernova distances. Adopting a few simple phenomenological models, we quantitatively demonstrate that a satisfactory fit with a model with late-time expansion history can only be achieved if one of the following is true: 1) there is a sharp step in the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae at very low redshift, $z\sim 0.01$, or 2) the distance duality relation, $d_L(z)=(1+z)^2d_A(z)$, is broken. Both solutions are trivial in that they effectively decouple the calibrated SNIa measurements from other data, and this qualitatively agrees with previous work built on studying specific dark-energy models. We also identify a less effective class of late-time solutions with a transition at $z\simeq 0.15$ that lead to a more modest improvement in fit to the data than models with a very low-z transition. Our conclusions are largely unchanged when we include surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements, with their current systematic uncertainties, to our analysis. We finally illustrate our findings by studying a physical model which, when equipped with the ability to smoothly change the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae, partially resolves the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Polarization Beam Response of SPT-3G Using Point Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of cosmic microwave background polarization require rigorous control of instrumental systematics. For the South Pole Telescope's third-generation camera (SPT-3G), accurate characterization of the beam is critical for understanding the polarized mm-wave sky. Here, we present direct measurements of SPT-3G's polarized beam response using observations of 100 polarized extragalactic point sources. Previous SPT-3G CMB power spectrum analyses introduced a phenomenological parameter $\beta_\mathrm{pol}$ to describe the degree of polarization preserved in beam sidelobes. These analyses found evidence for significant depolarization driven by the requirement of polarization power spectrum consistency between different frequency bands. Our direct measurements yield $\beta_\mathrm{pol}=0.90\pm0.10$ at 95 GHz, $1.01\pm0.12$ at 150 GHz, and $0.81\pm0.29$ at 220 GHz, indicating minimal sidelobe depolarization. We validate these results through extensive systematic tests including Bayesian posterior sampling versus frequentist bootstrap resampling, real-space versus Fourier-space analysis, and variations on temperature-to-polarization leakage handling, covariance determination, and source selection. When compared to values inferred from previous cosmological analyses, which favored significant depolarization to resolve inter-frequency power spectrum inconsistencies, we find a mild tension of $1.9\sigma$. However, this apparent discrepancy is dependent on the beam modeling, as our point source-based analysis derives much of its constraining power on $\beta_\mathrm{pol}$ from higher multipoles than the power spectrum analysis. These measurements therefore admit three explanations for the frequency-dependent residuals observed in the power spectrum analysis: a statistical fluctuation, the need for more sophisticated polarized beam models, or systematics other than beam depolarization.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Splashback Radii to z=1.65 from Galaxy Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2) is a WISE-selected catalog of galaxy clusters at $0.1&lt;z&lt;2$ covering an effective area of $&gt;6000$ deg$^2$. In this paper, we derive splashback radii for this cluster ensemble from galaxy density profiles and constrain the mass threshold of the survey as a function of redshift. We use MaDCoWS2 cluster candidates at $0.4\leq z \leq 1.65$ divided into subsamples with different signal-to-noise (S/N$_{\rm P}$) and redshifts, cross-correlated with galaxies from the CatWISE2020 catalog, to obtain average surface density profiles. We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to derive parameter estimates for theoretical models consisting of orbiting and infalling terms. A distinct splashback feature is detected in all subsamples. The measured splashback radii span from $0.89^{+0.02}_{-0.02}h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc/cMpc ($0.61^{+0.02}_{-0.02}h^{-1}$ proper Mpc/pMpc) at $\overline{z}=0.45$ to $1.27^{+0.05}_{-0.05}h^{-1}$ cMpc ($0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.04}h^{-1}$ pMpc) at $\overline{z}=1.54$. We also find that splashback radii increase with $S/N_{\rm P}$ at fixed redshift. The resultant splashback radii constrain the redshift dependence of the mass of MaDCoWS2 clusters at fixed $S/N_{\rm P}$. We calculate $M_{\rm 200m}$ from the radii using a relation based on a cosmological simulation. MaDCoWS2 $M_{\rm 200m}$ values derived from the simulation-based relation are lower than the expected values based on weak-lensing observations. More robust mass constraints will come from calibrating splashback radii derived from galaxy density profiles with weak lensing shear profiles from facilities such as $\textit{Euclid}$, Rubin, and $\textit{Roman}$.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Detection of splashback radii in galaxy cluster total light stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The splashback radius, the radius of the apocenter of the first orbit of infalling material, is a measurable quantity marking the boundary between a galaxy cluster and its infalling region. We report detections of splashback radii in total light stacks, i.e. image stacks centered on the cores of galaxy clusters. Our analysis uses Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 images of 83,345 candidate clusters at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.9$ from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). The clusters are organized in stacks by redshift and signal-to-noise ($S\slash N$) ratios. We adopt a statistical approach, using 1000 bootstrap realizations to determine the median projected splashback radius and its confidence interval in a given bin. We compare our splashback radii with the measurements made by K. Thongkham et al. on a similar sample of MaDCoWS2 clusters using galaxy-cluster cross-correlation and find that they are consistent, although our method yields larger error bars. Our main systematic error is the accuracy of the background subtraction, but its impact remains small: the consistency of K. Thongkham et al. and our results suggests that neither method suffers from large systematics. The sensitivity of total light stacking to the contribution of faint galaxies can be advantageous to locate splashback radii when only the brightest galaxies are detected in individual images, such as at high redshifts. We present a potential application of this new technique to probe the evolution of the stellar mass in cluster infalling regions.</description>

      <title>Universality of Primordial Anisotropies in Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model-independent formalism for describing anisotropies in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) originating from primordial perturbations. Despite their diverse physical origins -- such as Sachs-Wolfe effects, integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, or fossil effects from primordial non-Gaussianity -- SGWB anisotropies exhibit a universal angular structure. We show that this universality arises from a single vertex function, the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encodes the information on how long-wavelength modes modulate the SGWB statistics. Two fundamental principles -- statistical isotropy and locality -- uniquely determine the angular dependence of the CFF, resulting in a universal multipole scaling of the SGWB anisotropies. The CFF formalism provides a common language for classifying SGWB anisotropies and offers a powerful framework for interpreting upcoming observations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Abundance from Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive robust constraints on the initial abundance of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) using the reionization history of the Universe as a cosmological probe. We focus on PBHs that inject electromagnetic (EM) energy into the intergalactic medium (IGM) after recombination, in the mass range $3.2\times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{g} \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$. For each PBH mass, we compute the redshift-dependent energy injection from Hawking evaporation using \texttt{BlackHawk}, fully accounting for the time evolution of the PBH mass and the complete spectrum of emitted Standard Model particles and gravitons. The resulting photons and electrons are propagated through the primordial plasma using \texttt{DarkHistory}, which self-consistently models EM cascades and determines the fraction of injected energy deposited into ionization, excitation, and heating of the IGM. These modifications to the ionization and thermal histories are incorporated into a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the free-electron fraction based on low-$\ell$ CMB polarization data from the \textit{Planck} mission. This non-parametric approach allows for a statistically well-defined separation between exotic high-redshift energy injection and late-time astrophysical reionization, allowing PBH evaporation to be constrained through its contribution to the high-redshift optical depth. Requiring consistency with current CMB measurements, we obtain upper limits on the initial PBH abundance that are robust against reionization modeling uncertainties and systematically more conservative than existing bounds, reflecting the fully numerical and time-dependent treatment of Hawking evaporation and energy deposition. Our results demonstrate the power of reionization observables as a precision probe of PBH evaporation and other scenarios involving late-time energy injection.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical BUFFALOs: a weak lensing view of the Frontier Field clusters and associated systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are tracers of the large scale structures of the Universe, making the time evolution of their mass function dependent on key cosmological parameters, such as the cosmic matter density or the amplitude of density fluctuations $\sigma_8$. Accurate measurements of cluster's total masses are therefore essential, yet they can be challenging, particularly for clusters with complex morphologies, as simple mass profiles are often adopted to fit the measurements. In this work, we focus on the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters: a sample of six extremely massive systems, that, in most cases, exhibit highly complex mass distributions. The BUFFALO survey extended the Hubble Space Telescope observations for the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, providing high-resolution multi-band imaging within a few Mpc. Combining this high-quality imaging dataset with ancillary spectroscopy, we produce weak-lensing catalogues with very high source densities, about 50 sources/arcmin$^2$. This allows us to robustly estimate the individual weak-lensing cluster masses and quantify the sensitivity of these measurements on different factors, such as the cluster centring, the uncertainty on the redshift distribution or the foreground contamination and boost factor correction. This provides a data-driven analysis of the different sources of systematics that can impact such measurements. We find that the largest sources of systematic bias arise for the most disturbed clusters, such as the multi-modal, merging galaxy cluster Abell 2744. This analysis sets a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of systematics on the weak-lensing estimates of cluster masses, and in particular, in the case of unrelaxed clusters. This can play a key role in forthcoming cosmological analyses based on wide-field surveys such as Euclid and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time of the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Correlation Calibration: A Hybrid Calibration Technique for Radio Interferometric Arrays</title>

Abstract: Calibrating out per-antenna signal chain effects is an essential step in analyzing radio interferometric data. For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>Scalar Tsunamis from Black Hole Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and other macroscopic objects may be surrounded by potentially large field configurations of very light scalars coupled to ordinary matter. If the star ends in a black hole, e.g. via a supernova or a neutron star merger, the source vanishes, and the field is released. In this paper, we improve on previous estimates for the field configurations arriving at large distances by including the effects of general relativity and an improved modelling of the initial field configurations. The total amount of energy released is typically of the same order of magnitude as suggested by simple flat space estimates. The spectrum receives noticeable corrections.</description>

      <title>Rotational Behaviour of Exotic Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct exotic compact objects composed entirely of self-interacting asymmetric fermionic dark matter governed by a repulsive Yukawa potential with massive dark interaction boson. By considering the structural, tidal, and rotational properties of solar mass self-gravitating dark matter systems, and contrasting them against purely baryonic neutron stars, described by the well understood SLy4 equation of state, we hope to shed some light on the place of dark compact systems in the context of gravitational wave astronomy, specifically due to the difficulty parsing mass and radius data from events with no electromagnetic counterpart. Here we consider systems composed of 1 GeV and 10 GeV dark matter. Relevant compact objects are then analysed and simulated as both static bodies, and rotating systems governed by the Hartle-Thorne formalism to second order. Here within we highlight the differences in key tidal and rotational properties encoded in gravitational wave signals, and analyse how dark objects may mimic or distinguish themselves to current and future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Gravastar on the brane with a timelike extra dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a gravastar configuration within the Shtanov-Sahni (SS) braneworld scenario, characterized by a timelike extra dimension and negative brane tension. Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dark matter axion production is enhanced through a natural and unavoidable mechanism: primordial temperature fluctuations periodically modulate the axion mass during the QCD phase transition, thereby triggering parametric resonance in axion field evolution. This interplay between parametric resonance and the misalignment mechanism shifts the predicted axion mass window for the observed dark matter abundance to $10^{-4}-10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$, displacing the canonical axion mass window to previously unexplored higher ranges.</description>

      <title>Investigating cosmic strings using large-volume hydrodynamical simulations in the context of JWST's massive UV-bright galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered an unexpectedly large abundance of massive, UV-bright galaxies at high redshifts, presenting a significant challenge to established galaxy formation models within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework. Cosmic strings, predicted by a wide range of particle physics theories beyond the Standard Model, provide a promising potential explanation for these observations. They may act as additional gravitational seeds in the early universe, enhancing the process of high-redshift structure formation, potentially resulting in a more substantial population of massive, efficiently star-forming galaxies. We numerically investigate this prediction in large-volume hydrodynamical simulations using the moving-mesh code AREPO and the well-tested IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We evaluate the simulation results in the context of recent JWST data and find that sufficiently energetic cosmic strings produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions that are in slightly to substantially better agreement with observations at high redshifts. Moreover, we observe that the halos seeded by cosmic strings exhibit a greater efficiency of star formation and enhanced central concentrations. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the simulations incorporating cosmic strings converge with those from a baseline $\Lambda$CDM model by redshift $z \sim 6$. This convergence suggests that the modified cosmological framework effectively replicates the successful predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at lower redshifts, where observational constraints are significantly stronger. Our results provide compelling evidence that cosmic strings may play a crucial role in explaining the galaxy properties observed by JWST at high redshifts while maintaining consistency with well-established models at later epochs.</description>

      <title>ECHO21: a tool for modelling global 21-cm signal from dark ages to reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Python package called ECHO21 for modelling the global 21-cm signal from the dark ages through cosmic dawn to the end of reionization. Leveraging its analytical framework, ECHO21 generates a single model in $\mathcal{O}(1)\,$s, allowing a large number of signals to be generated efficiently by distributing models across multiple cores. Thus, it is ideal for performing astrophysical or cosmological inference from a given 21-cm dataset. We offer six astrophysical parameters that control the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emissivity, X-ray emissivity, emissivity of ionizing photons, and star formation rate. Beyond its efficiency some of the attractive and novel features in ECHO21 relative to previously published codes are inclusion of Ly$\alpha$ heating, ability to vary the standard cosmological parameters as easily as the astrophysical parameters, and different models of star formation rate density (physically-motivated, a semi-empirical, and an empirically-motivated). With a number of 21-cm experiments soon to provide cosmic dawn 21-cm data, ECHO21 is a flexible and extensible new open-source package for making quick but sufficiently realistic astrophysical inferences. We make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Tracing Missing Baryons in the Cosmic Filaments with tSZ and CMB-Lensing Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of missing baryons in the cosmic filaments by stacking $\sim 30,700$ filaments across the northern and southern SDSS sky regions using Planck Compton-$y$ and CMB lensing maps. Filaments are identified using the DisPerSE algorithm applied to the SDSS LOWZ-CMASS galaxy samples, selecting structures with lengths between 30-100 cMpc and redshifts in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$. Radial profiles are extracted out to 25 cMpc from the filament spines, and galaxy clusters with halo masses above $\sim 3 \times 10^{13} M_\odot$ are masked to reduce contamination. We detect the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) signal at $7.82\sigma$ and the CMB lensing signal at $7.78\sigma$. The stacked profiles are corrected by a geometric bias correction based on filament inclination with respect to the line-of-sight, and they are portrayed assuming isothermal, cylindrically symmetric models. We explore different gas and matter density distributions, focusing on the $\beta$-models with $(\alpha,\beta) = (2,2/3)$ or $(1,1)$. By jointly fitting the Compton-$y$ and $\kappa$ profiles, we constrain the central electron overdensity and temperature to be $\delta = 4.18^{+2.01}_{-1.06}$ and $T_e = 2.74^{+0.65}_{-0.53}\times 10^6 \mathrm{K}$ for the standard $\beta$-model. These results suggest that filamentary WHIM in our selected long filaments contributes a significant baryon fraction of $0.127^{+0.019}_{-0.021}\times \Omega_b$ to the cosmic baryon budget.</description>

      <title>From Redshift to Real Space: Combining Linear Theory With Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic redshift surveys are key tools to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and test the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, using redshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy distribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in LSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method that combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift space distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on dark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations. LT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns quasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then the NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales. The method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant performance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN alone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger correlations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately. The hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and halo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to NN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and quasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation functions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical model with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both approaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data and computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to more realistic galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Planck measurement of cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between Planck-$\Lambda$CDM and DESI-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state (EoS) through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we resolve this $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension by allowing for the DM non-minimally coupled to gravity via a quintessence field. This non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. Consequently, even though the usual effective EoS of the coupled quintessence apart from the standard CDM part never crosses but always above $w=-1$, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, and the tensions on neutrino mass and growth rate in the $\Lambda$CDM model are also relieved in our model as a result of the resolved $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension.</description>

      <title>CLASH-VLT: The variance in the velocity anisotropy profiles of galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The velocity anisotropy profiles, $\beta(r)$, of galaxy clusters are directly related to the shape of the orbits of their member galaxies. Knowledge of $\beta(r)$ is important to understand the assembly process of clusters and the evolutionary processes of their galaxies, and to improve the determination of cluster masses based on cluster kinematics. We determined the $\beta(r)$ of nine massive clusters at redshift $0.19 \leq z \leq 0.45$ from the CLASH-VLT data set, with 150 to 950 spectroscopic members each. We selected spectroscopic cluster members with the CLUMPS algorithm calibrated on cosmological simulations. We applied the MAMPOSSt code to the distribution of cluster members in projected phase-space to constrain the cluster mass profile, $M(r)$, using priors derived from a previous gravitational lensing analysis. Given the MAMPOSSt best-fit solution for $M(r)$, we then solved the inversion of the Jeans equation to determine $\beta(r)$ without assumptions of its functional form. We also ran the DS+ code to identify subclusters and characterize the dynamical status of our clusters. The average $\beta(r)$ is slightly radial, with the anisotropy increasing from $\beta \simeq 0.2$ at the cluster center, to $\beta \simeq 0.5$ at the virial radius. There is substantial variance in the $\beta(r)$ of the individual clusters, that cannot be entirely accounted for by the observational uncertainties. Clusters of lower mass and with a low concentration per given mass have more tangential $\beta(r)$. A comparison with cluster-sized halos in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations indicates a very good agreement for the average $\beta(r)$, but a smaller variance in the profiles than observed. We conclude that massive clusters cannot be characterized by a unique universal $\beta(r)$ and that the orbital distribution of cluster galaxies carries information on the merging history of the cluster.</description>

      <title>Can an Anti-de Sitter Vacuum in the Dark Energy Sector Explain JWST High-Redshift Galaxy and Reionization Observations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unexpectedly large abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$ discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope poses a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This work tests whether modifying the cosmological background, and thereby the growth of structures, can resolve this tension without invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early galaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring an anti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, which naturally arises in quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure formation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy evolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of observations. We show that while a model tailored to fit the high-$z$ UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) appears promising, it is in strong tension with cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift probes. Conversely, models within this framework that satisfy these constraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to reproduce the observed galaxy abundances at $z&gt;10$. Although these models remain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, we find that this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to explain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the importance of holistic testing for any beyond-$\Lambda$CDM proposal; apparent success in one observational regime does not guarantee overall viability. By demonstrating the limitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case that evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving the challenge of early galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z&gt;6 JWST Results? CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in the Near Future</title>

Abstract: The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts ($z &gt; 6$) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $10.4\sigma$ (and $29.8\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.</description>

      <title>A Light-Cone Approach to Higher-Order Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to studying the equivalence principle in dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour--Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough. Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.</description>

      <title>Metastable Strings and Gravitational Waves in One-Scale Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments. We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)\!\to\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole--antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, demonstrating the applicability of the thin-defect approximation throughout the phenomenologically favoured region and without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. The primary contribution of this work is the development of a numerically stable and flexible framework for implementing open-system effects in inflationary perturbations, rather than the extraction of concrete predictions for the primordial spectrum. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing cosmography using binary-black-hole mergers: Prospects for the near future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.</description>
