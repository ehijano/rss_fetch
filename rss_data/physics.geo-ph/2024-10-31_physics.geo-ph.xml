      <title>Ab initio superionic-liquid phase diagram of Fe1-xOx under Earth's inner core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superionic state represents a fundamental phase of matter where liquid-like mobility emerges within a solid crystalline lattice. This peculiar state has recently been discovered in the Earth's inner core. Despite extensive research on the kinetics of the superionic state and its geophysical impact on the Earth's core, the equilibration of the superionic phase with the liquid solution under core conditions has yet to be discovered. In this study, we develop a method to calculate the ab initio Gibbs free energy and the superionic-liquid phase diagram for the Fe1-xOx system under conditions near the Earth's inner core boundary. Our findings indicate oxygen can form superionic states in hcp and bcc iron. We elucidate the stability fields of these superionic phases, which vary significantly with oxygen stoichiometry. Furthermore, we show that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's inner core is likely higher than previously estimated due to the superionic state. This work offers a quantitative approach to studying the equilibrium between liquid and superionic solutions in Fe-light element systems under the extreme conditions of the Earth's core.</description>

      <title>Setting the stage: Building and maintaining a habitable world and the early conditions that could favor life's beginnings on Earth and beyond</title>

Abstract: The Hadean, once thought to be uninhabitable and tumultuous, has more recently been recontextualized as a clement time in which oceans, land, and life likely appeared on Earth. This non-exhaustive chapter follows multiple threads from planet formation to the origin of life. We place significant emphasis on the solar system context for the Earth, the timing and nature of crustal formation and the evolution of the surface and atmosphere. Several scenarios for prebiotic chemistry are also discussed including atmospheric photochemistry, wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles, and hydrothermal vent systems. We attempt to draw connections between the large-scale, planetary processes and various origin of life pathways to illustrate possible overlaps and correlations. In detail, we conclude with and discuss the "impact of impacts" to show how asteroid and comet impacts during the Hadean may have affected many of these processes and scenarios, from generating land to altering the chemical composition and oxidation state of the early Earth's atmosphere and surface.</description>

      <title>Alternative climatic steady states near the Permian-Triassic Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to spatial scarcity and uncertainties in sediment data, initial and boundary conditions in deep-time climate simulations are not well constrained. On the other hand, the climate is a nonlinear system with a multitude of feedback mechanisms that compete and balance differently depending on the initial and boundary conditions. This opens up the possibility to obtain multiple steady states under the same forcing in numerical experiments. Here, we use the MIT general circulation model with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-thermodynamic sea ice-land configuration to explore the existence of such alternative steady states around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB). We construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram, taking into account processes on a timescale of thousands of years, in order to identify the stability range of the steady states and tipping points as the atmospheric CO$_2$ content is varied. We find three alternative steady states with a difference in global mean surface air temperature of about 10 $^\circ$C. We also examine how these climatic steady states are modified when feedbacks operating on comparable or longer time scales are included, in particular vegetation dynamics and air-sea carbon exchanges. Our findings on multistability provide a useful framework for explaining the climatic variations observed in the Early Triassic geological record, as well as some discrepancies between numerical simulations in the literature and geological data at PTB and its aftermath.</description>

      <title>Assessing the climate benefits of afforestation: processes, methods, and frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Afforestation greatly influences several earth system processes, making it essential to understand these effects to accurately assess its potential for climate change mitigation. Although our understanding of forest-climate system interactions has improved, significant knowledge gaps remain, preventing definitive assessments of afforestation's net climate benefits. In this review, focusing on the Canadian northern boreal and southern arctic, we identify these gaps and synthesize existing knowledge. The review highlights regional realities, Earth's climatic history, uncertainties in biogeochemical (BGC) and biogeophysical (BGP) changes following afforestation, and limitations in current assessment methodologies, emphasizing the need to reconcile these uncertainties before drawing firm conclusions about the climate benefits of afforestation. Finally, we propose an assessment framework which considers multiple forcing components, temporal analysis, future climatic contexts, and implementation details. We hope that the research gaps and assessment framework discussed in this review inform afforestation policy in Canada and other circumpolar nations.</description>
