      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-1609Lb: Sub-jovian planet orbiting a low-mass stellar or brown dwarf host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of a planetary microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1609. The planetary anomaly was detected by two survey telescopes, OGLE and MOA. Each of these surveys collected enough data over the planetary anomaly to allow for an unambiguous planet detection. Such survey detections of planetary anomalies are needed to build a robust sample of planets that could improve studies on the microlensing planetary occurrence rate by reducing biases and statistical uncertainties. In this work, we examined different methods for modeling microlensing events using individual datasets, particularly we incorporated a Galactic model prior to better constrain poorly defined microlensing parallax. Ultimately, we fitted a comprehensive model to all available data, identifying three potential typologies, with two showing comparably high Bayesian evidence. Our analysis indicates that the host of the planet is a brown dwarf with a probability of 34%, or a low-mass stellar object (M-dwarf) with the probability of 66%.</description>

      <title>Rotating convection with a melting boundary: an application to the icy moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A better understanding of the ice-ocean couplings is required to better characterise the hydrosphere of the icy moons. Using global numerical simulations in spherical geometry, we have investigated here the interplay between rotating convection and a melting boundary. To do so, we have implemented and validated a phase field formulation in the open-source code \texttt{MagIC}. We have conducted a parameter study varying the influence of rotation, the vigour of the convective forcing and the melting temperature. We have evidenced different regimes akin to those already found in previous monophasic models in which the mean axisymmetric ice crust transits from pole-ward thinning to equator-ward thinning with the increase of the rotational constraint on the flow. The derivation of a perturbative model of heat conduction in the ice layer enabled us to relate those mean topographic changes to the underlying latitudinal heat flux variations at the top of the ocean. The phase change has also been found to yield the formation of sizeable non-axisymmetric topography at the solid-liquid interface with a typical size close to that of the convective columns. We have shown that the typical evolution timescale of the interface increases linearly with the crest-to-trough amplitude and quadratically with the mean melt radius. In the case of the largest topographic changes, the convective flows become quasi locked in the topography due to the constructive coupling between convection and ice melting. The tentative extrapolation to the planetary regimes yields $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$ meters for the amplitude of non-axisymmetric topography at the base of the ice layer of Enceladus and $\mathcal{O}(10^3-10^4)$ meters for Titan.</description>

      <title>The Multiband Imaging Survey for High-Alpha PlanetS (MISHAPS) I: Preliminary Constraints on the Occurrence Rate of Hot Jupiters in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first generation of transiting planet searches in globular clusters yielded no detections, and in hindsight, only placed occurrence rate limits slightly higher than the measured occurrence rate in the higher-metallicity Galactic thick disk. To improve these limits, we present the first results of a new wide field search for transiting hot Jupiters in the globular cluster 47~Tucanae. We have observed 47~Tuc as part of the Multiband Imaging Survey for High-Alpha Planets (MISHAPS). Using 24 partial and full nights of observations taken with the Dark Energy Camera on the 4-m Blanco telescope at CTIO, we perform a search on 19,930 stars in the outer regions of the cluster. Though we find no clear planet detections, by combining our result with the upper limit enabled by Gilliland et al.'s 2000 Hubble search for planets around an independent sample of 34,091 stars in the inner cluster, we place the strongest limit to date on hot Jupiters with periods of $0.8 \leq P \leq 8.3$ days and $0.5~R_{\rm Jup} \leq R_{\rm P} \leq 2.0~R_{\rm Jup}$ of $f_{\rm HJ} &lt; 0.11\%$, a factor of ${\sim}$4 below the occurrence rate in the \textit{Kepler} field. Our search found 35 transiting planet candidates, though we are ultimately able to rule out each without follow-up observations. We also found 4 eclipsing binaries, including 3 previously-uncataloged detached eclipsing binary stars.</description>

      <title>Vertical Shear Instability in Thermally-Stratified Protoplanetary Disks: I. A Linear Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical shear instability (VSI), driven by a vertical gradient of rotational angular velocity, is a promising source of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. We examine the semi-global stability of thermally stratified disks and find that the VSI consists of surface and body modes: surface modes are confined to regions of strong shear, while body modes extend perturbations across the disk, consistent with the previous findings. In thermally stratified disks, surface modes bifurcate into two branches. The branch associated with the strongest shear at mid-height exhibits a higher growth rate compared to the branch near the surfaces. Surface modes generally grow rapidly and require a high radial wave number $k_R$, whereas body mode growth rates increase as $k_R$ decreases. Thermal stratification enhances the growth rates of both surface and body modes and boosts VSI-driven radial kinetic energy relative to vertical energy. Our results suggest that simulations will initially favor surface modes with large $k_R$, followed by an increase in body modes with smaller $k_R$, with faster progression in more thermal stratified disks.</description>

      <title>Vertical Shear Instability in Thermally-Stratified Protoplanetary Disks: II. Hydrodynamic Simulations and Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the nonlinear outcomes and observability of vertical shear instability (VSI) in protoplanetary disks. Our models include both vertically isothermal and thermally stratified disks, with the latter representing realistic conditions featuring a hotter atmosphere above the midplane. We find that the VSI grows more rapidly and becomes stronger in thermally stratified disks due to enhanced shear, resulting in higher levels of turbulence. At saturation, the turbulence stress reaches $\alpha_{R\phi}\gtrsim 10^{-3}$, more than an order of magnitude stronger than the isothermal case. The saturated turbulence is more pronounced near the disk surfaces than at the midplane. On synthetic velocity residual maps, obtained by subtracting the Keplerian rotational velocity, perturbations driven by the VSI manifest as axisymmetric rings in isothermal disks and as ring segments in thermally stratified disks. The latter are visible at disk inclinations as high as $45^\circ$ in thermally stratified disks. The amplitudes of these residual velocities range from $\sim 50$ to $\sim100$ $\mathrm{m\ s}^{-1}$ at a $20^\circ$ inclination, with larger values corresponding to greater thermal stratification. The magnitude of the observed velocity residual increases with the optical depth of the tracer used, as optically thick lines probe the regions near the disk surfaces.</description>

      <title>Ultra Low Velocity Ejecta Generated by Slow Impacts on Rubble Pile Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine ejecta generated by ultra low velocity impacts under asteroid conditions. In an environment of precisely controlled milligravity and under vacuum, impacts with velocities in the range of centimeters/second are performed with irregularly shaped impactors onto granular beds. The resulting ejecta velocities are compared to existing literature values and extend the observed systematic trends towards lower impact energies, broadening the parameter range. Simulations are performed to reason the systematics and the absence thereof for measurements performed at earth gravity. We find, that the cutoff induced by gravity dependent minimal observable velocities plays a crucial role in the values obtained for mean ejecta velocities.</description>

      <title>From CO$_2$- to H$_2$O-dominated atmospheres and back -- How mixed outgassing changes the volatile distribution in magma oceans around M dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of CO$_2$ on TRAPPIST-1 e, f and g during the magma ocean stage. These potentially habitable rocky planets are currently the most accessible for astronomical observations. A constraint on the volatile budget during the magma ocean stage is a link to planet formation and also needed to judge their habitability. We perform simulations with 1-100 terrestrial oceans (TO) of H$_2$O with and without CO$_2$ and for albedos 0 and 0.75. The CO$_2$ mass is scaled with initial H$_2$O by a constant factor between 0.1 and 1.
  The magma ocean state of rocky planets begins with a CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere but can evolve into a H$_2$O dominated state, depending on initial conditions. For less than 10 TO initial H$_2$O, the atmosphere tends to desiccate and the evolution may end with a CO$_2$ dominated atmosphere. Otherwise, the final state is a thick (&gt;1000 bar) H$_2$O-CO$_2$ atmosphere. Complete atmosphere desiccation with less than 10 TO initial H$_2$O can be significantly delayed for TRAPPIST-1e and f, when H$_2$O has to diffuse through a CO$_2$ atmosphere to reach the upper atmosphere, where XUV photolysis occurs. As a consequence of CO$_2$ diffusion-limited water loss, the time of mantle solidification for TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g can be significantly extended compared to a pure H$_2$O evolution by up to 40 Myrs for albedo 0.75 and by up to 200 Mrys for albedo 0. The addition of CO$_2$ further results in a higher water content in the melt during the magma ocean stage. Our compositional model adjusted for the measured metallicity of TRAPPIST-1 yields for the dry inner planets (b, c, d) an iron fraction of 27 wt-%. For TRAPPIST-1 e, this iron fraction would be compatible with a (partly) desiccated evolution scenario and a CO$_2$ atmosphere with surface pressures of a few 100 bar. A comparative study between TRAPPIST-1 e and the inner planets may yield the most insights about formation and evolution scenarios.</description>

      <title>On The Lunar Origin of Near-Earth Asteroid 2024 PT5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) 2024 PT5 is on an Earth-like orbit which remained in Earth's immediate vicinity for several months at the end of 2024. PT5's orbit is challenging to populate with asteroids originating from the Main Belt and is more commonly associated with rocket bodies mistakenly identified as natural objects or with debris ejected from impacts on the Moon. We obtained visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra of PT5 with the Lowell Discovery Telescope and NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on 2024 August 16. The combined reflectance spectrum matches lunar samples but does not match any known asteroid types -- it is pyroxene-rich while asteroids of comparable spectral redness are olivine-rich. Moreover, the amount of solar radiation pressure observed on the PT5 trajectory is orders of magnitude lower than what would be expected for an artificial object. We therefore conclude that 2024 PT5 is ejecta from an impact on the Moon, thus making PT5 the second NEA suggested to be sourced from the surface of the Moon. While one object might be an outlier, two suggest that there is an underlying population to be characterized. Long-term predictions of the position of 2024 PT5 are challenging due to the slow Earth encounters characteristic of objects in these orbits. A population of near-Earth objects which are sourced by the Moon would be important to characterize for understanding how impacts work on our nearest neighbor and for identifying the source regions of asteroids and meteorites from this under-studied population of objects on very Earth-like orbits.</description>

      <title>PAStar: a model for stellar surface from the Sun to active stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The characterization of exoplanets requires a good description of the host star. Stellar activity acts as a source of noise which can alter planet radii as derived from the transit depth or atmospheric characterization. Aims. Here, we propose PAStar, a model to describe photospheric activity in the form of spots and faculae which could be applied to a wide range of stellar observations, from photometric to spectroscopic time series, to be able to correctly extract planetary and stellar properties. Methods. The adopted stellar atmosphere is a combination of three components, the quiet photosphere, spots and faculae. The model takes into account the effects of star inclination, doppler shifts due to stellar rotation as well as for limb darkening, independent for each component. Several synthetic products have been presented to show the capabilities of the model. Results. The model is able to retrieve the input surface inhomogeneities configuration through photometric or spectroscopic observations. The model has been validated against optical solar data and compared to alternative stellar surface activity models; e.g. SOAP code. The Sun is a unique laboratory to test stellar models because of the possibility to relate unambiguously flux variations to surface inhomogeneities configuration. This validation has been done by analyzing a photometric time series from the VIRGO photometer on board of SOHO mission. Results have been compared to real solar images from the HMI instrument on board of SDO to confirm the goodness of the results in terms of surface inhomogeneities position and dimensions. Conclusions. The description of stellar activity is a fundamental step in several astrophysical contexts and it is covered by the method we have presented. Our model offers a flexible and valuable tool to describe the activity of stars when it is dominated by spots and faculae.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of the MIRAC-5 Mid-Infrared Instrument on the MMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from commissioning observations of the mid-IR instrument, MIRAC-5, on the 6.5-m MMT telescope. MIRAC-5 is a novel ground-based instrument that utilizes a state-of-the-art GeoSnap (2 - 13 microns) HgCdTe detector with adaptive optics support from MAPS to study protoplanetary disks, wide-orbit brown dwarfs, planetary companions in the contrast-limit, and a wide range of other astrophysical objects. We have used MIRAC-5 on six engineering observing runs, improving its performance and defining operating procedures. We characterize key aspects of MIRAC-5's performance, including verification that the total telescope, atmosphere, instrument, and detector throughput is approximately 10%. Following a planned dichroic upgrade, the system will have a throughput of 20% and background limiting magnitudes (for SNR = 5 and 8 hour exposure times) of 18.0, 15.6, and 12.6 for the L', M', and N' filters, respectively. The detector pixels experience 1/f noise but, if the astrophysical scene is properly modulated via chopping and nodding sequences, it is less than 10% the Poisson noise from the observed background in an 85 Hz frame. We achieve close to diffraction-limited performance in the N-band and all bands are expected to reach diffraction-limited performance following the adaptive optics system commissioning. We also present an exposure time calculator calibrated to the on-sky results. In its current state, MIRAC-5 will be capable of achieving several scientific objectives including the observation of warm wide-orbit companions. Once the adaptive optics is commissioned and a coronagraph installed in 2025, MIRAC-5 will have contrast-limited performance comparable to JWST, opening new and complementary science investigations for close-in companions.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Distributions of Disc-Embedded Accreting Protoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many dozens of circumstellar discs show signatures of sculpting by planets. To help find these protoplanets by direct imaging, we compute their broadband spectral energy distributions, which overlap with the JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) and ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) passbands. We consider how circumplanetary spherical envelopes and circumplanetary discs are heated by accretion and irradiation. Searches with JWST's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and the blue portion of MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) are most promising since $\sim$300--1000 K protoplanets outshine their $\sim$20--50 K circumstellar environs at wavelengths of $\sim$2--10 $\mu$m. Detection is easier if circumplanetary dust settles into discs (more likely for more massive planets) or is less abundant per unit mass gas (because of grain growth or aerodynamic filtration). At wavelengths longer than 20 $\mu$m, circumplanetary material is difficult to see against the circumstellar disc's surface layers that directly absorb starlight and reprocess it to the far-infrared. Such contaminating circumstellar emission can be serious even within the evacuated gaps observed by ALMA. Only in strongly depleted regions, like the cavity of the transitional disc PDS 70 where two protoplanets have been confirmed, may long-wavelength windows open for protoplanet study. We compile a list of candidate protoplanets and identify those with potentially the highest accretion luminosities, all peaking in the near-infrared.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Interferometer: Space-based interferometric detections of PDS 70 b and c at 4.8 $\mu$m</title>

Abstract: We observed the planet-hosting system PDS 70 with the James Webb Interferometer, JWST's Aperture Masking Interferometric (AMI) mode within NIRISS. Observing with the F480M filter centered at 4.8 $\mu$m, we simultaneously fit geometrical models to the outer disk and the two known planetary companions. We re-detect the protoplanets PDS 70 b and c at an SNR of 14.7 and 7.0, respectively. Our photometry of both PDS 70 b and c provides tentative evidence of mid-IR circumplanetary disk emission through fitting SED models to these new measurements and those found in the literature. We also newly detect emission within the disk gap at an SNR of $\sim$4, at a position angle of $220^{+10}_{-15}$ degrees, and an unconstrained separation within $\sim$200 mas. Follow-up observations will be needed to determine the nature of this emission. We place a 5$\sigma$ upper limit of 208 $\pm$ 10 $\mu$Jy on the flux of the candidate PDS 70 d at 4.8 $\mu$m, which indicates that if the previously observed emission at shorter wavelengths is due to a planet, this putative planet has a different atmospheric composition than PDS 70 b or c. Finally, we place upper limits on emission from any additional planets in the disk gap. We find an azimuthally averaged 5$\sigma$ contrast upper limit $&gt;$7 magnitudes at separations greater than 110 mas. These are the deepest limits to date within $\sim$250 mas at 4.8 $\mu$m and the first space-based interferometric observations of this system.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of TOI-406 as showcase of the THIRSTEE program: A 2-planet system straddling the M-dwarf density gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exoplanet sub-Neptune population currently poses a conundrum, as to whether small-size planets are volatile-rich cores without an atmosphere, or rocky cores surrounded by a H-He envelope. To test the different hypotheses from an observational point of view, a large sample of small-size planets with precise mass and radius measurements is the first step. On top of that, much more information will likely be needed, including atmospheric characterisation and a demographic perspective on their bulk properties. We present here the concept and strategy of the THIRSTEE project, which aims to shed light on the composition of the sub-Neptune population across stellar types by increasing their number and improving the accuracy of bulk density measurements, as well as investigating their atmospheres and performing statistical, demographic analysis. We report the first results of the program, characterising a new two-planet system around the M-dwarf TOI-406. We analyse TESS and ground-based photometry, together with ESPRESSO and NIRPS/HARPS RVs to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal composition of the 2 planets orbiting TOI-406, which have radii and masses of $R_c = 1.32 \pm 0.12 R_{\oplus}$, $M_c = 2.08_{-0.22}^{+0.23} M_{\oplus}$ and $R_b = 2.08_{-0.15}^{+0.16} R_{\oplus}$, $M_b = 6.57_{-0.90}^{+1.00} M_{\oplus}$, and periods of $3.3$ and $13.2$ days, respectively. Planet c is consistent with an Earth-like composition, while planet b is compatible with multiple internal composition models, including volatile-rich planets without H/He atmospheres. The 2 planets are located in 2 distinct regions in the mass-density diagram, supporting the existence of a density gap among small exoplanets around M dwarfs. With an T$_{\rm eq}$ of only 368 K, TOI-406 b stands up as a particularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation with JWST in the low-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>A search for self-lensing binaries with TESS and constraints on their occurrence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Five self-lensing binaries (SLBs) have been discovered with Kepler light curves. They contain white dwarfs (WDs) in AU-scale orbits that gravitationally lens solar-type companions. Forming SLBs likely requires common envelope evolution when the WD progenitor is an AGB star and has a weakly bound envelope. No SLBs have yet been discovered with data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which observes far more stars than Kepler did. Identifying self-lensing in TESS data is made challenging by the fact that TESS only observes most stars for $\sim$25 days at a time, so only a single lensing event will be observed for typical SLBs. TESS's smaller aperture also makes it sensitive only to SLBs a factor of $\sim$100 brighter than those to which Kepler is sensitive. We demonstrate that TESS has nevertheless likely already observed $\sim$4 times more detectable SLBs than Kepler. We describe a search for non-repeating self-lensing signals in TESS light curves and present preliminary candidates for which spectroscopic follow-up is ongoing. We calculate the sensitivity of our search with injection and recovery tests on TESS and Kepler light curves. Based on the 5 SLBs discovered with Kepler light curves, we estimate that $(1.1 \pm 0.6)\%$ of solar-type stars are orbited by WDs with periods of 100-1000 d. This implies a space density of AU-scale WD + main sequence (MS) binaries a factor of 20-100 larger than that of astrometrically-identified WD + MS binaries with orbits in Gaia DR3. We conclude that the Gaia sample is still quite incomplete, mainly because WD + MS binaries can only be unambiguously identified as such for high mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Starkiller: subtracting stars and other sources from IFU spectroscopic data through forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.</description>
