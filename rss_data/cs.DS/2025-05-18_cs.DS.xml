      <title>Generalization of Repetitiveness Measures for Two-Dimensional Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of detecting and measuring the repetitiveness of one-dimensional strings has been extensively studied in data compression and text indexing. Our understanding of these issues has been significantly improved by the introduction of the notion of string attractor [Kempa and Prezza, STOC 2018] and by the results showing the relationship between attractors and other measures of compressibility.
  When the input data are structured in a non-linear way, as in two-dimensional strings, inherent redundancy often offers an even richer source for compression. However, systematic studies on repetitiveness measures for two-dimensional strings are still scarce. In this paper we extend to two or more dimensions the main measures of complexity introduced for one-dimensional strings. We distinguish between the measures $\delta$ and $\gamma$, defined in terms of the substrings of the input, and the measures $g$, $g_{rl}$, and $b$, which are based on copy-paste mechanisms. We study the properties and mutual relationships between these two classes and we show that the two classes become incomparable for $d$-dimensional inputs as soon as $d\geq 2$. Moreover, we show that our grammar-based representation of a $d$-dimensional string of size $N$ enables direct access to any symbol in $O(\log N)$ time.
  We also compare our measures for two-dimensional strings with the 2D Block Tree data structure [Brisaboa et al., Computer J., 2024] and provide some insights for the design of future effective two-dimensional compressors.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth vs BFS Width in Matrix Reordering, Graph Reconstruction, and Graph Drawing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first approximation quality guarantees for the Cuthull-McKee heuristic for reordering symmetric matrices to have low bandwidth, and we provide an algorithm for reconstructing bounded-bandwidth graphs from distance oracles with near-linear query complexity. To prove these results we introduce a new width parameter, BFS width, and we prove polylogarithmic upper and lower bounds on the BFS width of graphs of bounded bandwidth. Unlike other width parameters, such as bandwidth, pathwidth, and treewidth, BFS width can easily be computed in polynomial time. Bounded BFS width implies bounded bandwidth, pathwidth, and treewidth, which in turn imply fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for many problems that are NP-hard for general graphs. In addition to their applications to matrix ordering, we also provide applications of BFS width to graph reconstruction, to reconstruct graphs from distance queries, and graph drawing, to construct arc diagrams of small height.</description>

      <title>Locally Differentially Private Graph Clustering via the Power Iteration Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a locally differentially private graph clustering algorithm. Previous works have explored this problem, including approaches that apply spectral clustering to graphs generated via the randomized response algorithm. However, these methods only achieve accurate results when the privacy budget is in $\Omega(\log n)$, which is unsuitable for many practical applications. In response, we present an interactive algorithm based on the power iteration method. Given that the noise introduced by the largest eigenvector constant can be significant, we incorporate a technique to eliminate this constant. As a result, our algorithm attains local differential privacy with a constant privacy budget when the graph is well-clustered and has a minimum degree of $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$. In contrast, while randomized response has been shown to produce accurate results under the same minimum degree condition, it is limited to graphs generated from the stochastic block model. We perform experiments to demonstrate that our method outperforms spectral clustering applied to randomized response results.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Model Checking in External Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the external memory BDD package Adiar with support for monotone variable substitution. Doing so, it now supports the relational product operation at the heart of symbolic model checking. We also identify additional avenues for merging variable substitution fully and the conjunction operation partially inside the relational product's existential quantification step. For smaller BDDs, these additional ideas improve the running of Adiar for model checking tasks up to 47%. For larger instances, the computation time is mostly unaffected as it is dominated by the existential quantification.
  Adiar's relational product is about one order of magnitude slower than conventional depth-first BDD implementations. Yet, its I/O-efficiency allows its running time to be virtually independent of the amount of internal memory. This allows it to compute on BDDs with much less internal memory and potentially to solve model checking tasks beyond the reach of conventional implementations.
  Compared to the only other external memory BDD package, CAL, Adiar is several orders of magnitude faster when computing on larger instances.</description>

      <title>Depth first representations of $k^2$-trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k^2$-tree is a compact data structure designed to efficiently store sparse binary matrices by leveraging both sparsity and clustering of nonzero elements. This representation supports efficiently navigational operations and complex binary operations, such as matrix-matrix multiplication, while maintaining space efficiency. The standard $k^2$-tree follows a level-by-level representation, which, while effective, prevents further compression of identical subtrees and it si not cache friendly when accessing individual subtrees. In this work, we introduce some novel depth-first representations of the $k^2$-tree and propose an efficient linear-time algorithm to identify and compress identical subtrees within these structures. Our experimental results show that the use of a depth-first representations is a strategy worth pursuing: for the adjacency matrix of web graphs exploiting the presence of identical subtrees does improve the compression ratio, and for some matrices depth-first representations turns out to be faster than the standard $k^2$-tree in computing the matrix-matrix multiplication.</description>

      <title>Computing in a Faulty Congested Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a \textsf{Faulty Congested Clique} model, in which an adversary may fail nodes in the network throughout the computation. We show that any task of $O(n\log{n})$-bit input per node can be solved in roughly $n$ rounds, where $n$ is the size of the network. This nearly matches the linear upper bound on the complexity of the non-faulty \clique model for such problems, by learning the entire input, and it holds in the faulty model even with a linear number of faults.
  Our main contribution is that we establish that one can do much better by looking more closely at the computation. Given a deterministic algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ for the non-faulty \textsf{Congested Clique} model, we show how to transform it into an algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ for the faulty model, with an overhead that could be as small as some logarithmic-in-$n$ factor, by considering refined complexity measures of $\mathcal{A}$.
  As an exemplifying application of our approach, we show that the $O(n^{1/3})$-round complexity of semi-ring matrix multiplication [Censor{-}Hillel, Kaski, Korhonen, Lenzen, Paz, Suomela, PODC 2015] remains the same up to polylog factors in the faulty model, even if the adversary can fail $99\%$ of the nodes.</description>

      <title>Unsolvability and Beyond in Many-To-Many Non-Bipartite Stable Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Stable Fixtures problem, a many-to-many generalisation of the classical non-bipartite Stable Roommates matching problem. Building on the foundational work of Tan on stable partitions, we extend his results to this significantly more general setting and develop a rich framework for understanding stable structures in many-to-many contexts. Our main contribution, the notion of a generalised stable partition (GSP), not only characterises the solution space of this problem, but also serves as a versatile tool for reasoning about ordinal preference systems with capacity constraints.
  We show that GSPs can be computed efficiently and provide an elegant representation of a problem instance, tightly characterising its preference structure and succinctly certifying the existence and non-existence of stable matchings. Leveraging a connection to stable half matchings, we also establish a non-bipartite analogue of the Rural Hospitals Theorem for stable half-matchings and GSPs, and connect our results to recent work on near-feasible matchings, providing a simpler algorithm and tighter analysis for this problem. Our work also addresses the computational challenges of finding optimal stable half-matchings and GSPs, presenting a flexible integer linear programming model for various objectives.
  Beyond theoretical insights, we conduct the first empirical analysis of random Stable Fixtures instances, uncovering surprising results, such as the impact of capacity functions on the solvability likelihood. Our work not only unifies and extends classical and recent perspectives on stability in non-bipartite stable matching but also establishes new tools, techniques, and directions for advancing the study of stable matchings and their applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04514v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.</description>

      <title>Prefix-bounded matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By unifying various earlier extensions of alternating sign matrices (ASMs), we introduce the notion of prefix-bounded matrices (PBMs). It is shown that the convex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special (called laminar) g-polymatroids. This implies (in a more general form) that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight and by Striker for describing the polytope of alternating sign matrices is TDI, confirming a recent conjecture of Edmonds. By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a characterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting upper and lower bound requirements on their entries.
  Furthermore, we point out that the constraint matrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs (in particular, ASMs) is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network flow techniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural results on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually box-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs has (a sharpened form of) the integer Carath\'eodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property. This latter feature makes it possible to confirm (in an extended form) an elegant conjecture of Brualdi and Dahl on the decomposability of a so-called $k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs.</description>

      <title>Lasso and Partially-Rotated Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the sparse linear regression model $\mathbf{y} = X \beta +\mathbf{w}$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ is the design, $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a $k$-sparse secret, and $\mathbf{w} \sim N(0, I_n)$ is the noise. Given input $X$ and $\mathbf{y}$, the goal is to estimate $\beta$. In this setting, the Lasso estimate achieves prediction error $O(k \log d / \gamma n)$, where $\gamma$ is the restricted eigenvalue (RE) constant of $X$ with respect to $\mathrm{support}(\beta)$. In this paper, we introduce a new $\textit{semirandom}$ family of designs -- which we call $\textit{partially-rotated}$ designs -- for which the RE constant with respect to the secret is bounded away from zero even when a subset of the design columns are arbitrarily correlated among themselves.
  As an example of such a design, suppose we start with some arbitrary $X$, and then apply a random rotation to the columns of $X$ indexed by $\mathrm{support}(\beta)$. Let $\lambda_{\min}$ be the smallest eigenvalue of $\frac{1}{n} X_{\mathrm{support}(\beta)}^\top X_{\mathrm{support}(\beta)}$, where $X_{\mathrm{support}(\beta)}$ is the restriction of $X$ to the columns indexed by $\mathrm{support}(\beta)$. In this setting, our results imply that Lasso achieves prediction error $O(k \log d / \lambda_{\min} n)$ with high probability. This prediction error bound is independent of the arbitrary columns of $X$ not indexed by $\mathrm{support}(\beta)$, and is as good as if all of these columns were perfectly well-conditioned.
  Technically, our proof reduces to showing that matrices with a certain deterministic property -- which we call $\textit{restricted normalized orthogonality}$ (RNO) -- lead to RE constants that are independent of a subset of the matrix columns. This property is similar but incomparable with the restricted orthogonality condition of [CT05].</description>

Abstract: A monotone drawing of a graph G is a straight-line drawing of G such that every pair of vertices is connected by a path that is monotone with respect to some direction.
  Trees, as a special class of graphs, have been the focus of several papers and, recently, He and He~\cite{mt:4} showed how to produce a monotone drawing of an arbitrary $n$-vertex tree that is contained in a $12n \times 12n$ grid.
  All monotone tree drawing algorithms that have appeared in the literature consider rooted ordered trees and they draw them so that (i) the root of the tree is drawn at the origin of the drawing, (ii) the drawing is confined in the first quadrant, and (iii) the ordering/embedding of the tree is respected. In this paper, we provide a simple algorithm that has the exact same characteristics and, given an $n$-vertex rooted tree $T$, it outputs a monotone drawing of $T$ that fits on a $n \times n$ grid.
  For unrooted ordered trees, we present an algorithms that produces monotone drawings that respect the ordering and fit in an $(n+1) \times (\frac{n}{2} +1)$ grid, while, for unrooted non-ordered trees we produce monotone drawings of good aspect ratio which fit on a grid of size at most $\left\lfloor \frac{3}{4} \left(n+2\right)\right\rfloor \times \left\lfloor \frac{3}{4} \left(n+2\right)\right\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Finding planted cliques using gradient descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planted clique problem is a paradigmatic model of statistical-to-computational gaps: the planted clique is information-theoretically detectable if its size $k\ge 2\log_2 n$ but polynomial-time algorithms only exist for the recovery task when $k= \Omega(\sqrt{n})$. By now, there are many algorithms that succeed as soon as $k = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Glaringly, however, no black-box optimization method, e.g., gradient descent or the Metropolis process, has been shown to work. In fact, Chen, Mossel, and Zadik recently showed that any Metropolis process whose state space is the set of cliques fails to find any sub-linear sized planted clique in polynomial time if initialized naturally from the empty set. We show that using the method of Lagrange multipliers, namely optimizing the Hamiltonian given by the sum of the objective function and the clique constraint over the space of all subgraphs, succeeds. In particular, we prove that Markov chains which minimize this Hamiltonian (gradient descent and a low-temperature relaxation of it) succeed at recovering planted cliques of size $k = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$ if initialized from the full graph. Importantly, initialized from the empty set, the relaxation still does not help the gradient descent find sub-linear planted cliques. We also demonstrate robustness of these Markov chain approaches under a natural contamination model.</description>

      <title>Metric Embeddings Beyond Bi-Lipschitz Distortion via Sherali-Adams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric embeddings are a widely used method in algorithm design, where generally a ``complex'' metric is embedded into a simpler, lower-dimensional one. Historically, the theoretical computer science community has focused on bi-Lipschitz embeddings, which guarantee that every pairwise distance is approximately preserved. In contrast, alternative embedding objectives that are commonly used in practice avoid bi-Lipschitz distortion; yet these approaches have received comparatively less study in theory. In this paper, we focus on Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS), where we are given a set of non-negative dissimilarities $\{d_{i,j}\}_{i,j\in [n]}$ over $n$ points, and the goal is to find an embedding $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \subset R^k$ that minimizes $$\textrm{OPT}=\min_{x}\mathbb{E}_{i,j\in [n]}\left(1-\frac{\|x_i - x_j\|}{d_{i,j}}\right)^2.$$
  Despite its popularity, our theoretical understanding of MDS is extremely limited. Recently, Demaine et. al. (arXiv:2109.11505) gave the first approximation algorithm with provable guarantees for this objective, which achieves an embedding in constant dimensional Euclidean space with cost $\textrm{OPT} +\epsilon$ in $n^2\cdot 2^{\textrm{poly}(\Delta/\epsilon)}$ time, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the input dissimilarities. For metrics that admit low-cost embeddings, $\Delta$ scales polynomially in $n$. In this work, we give the first approximation algorithm for MDS with quasi-polynomial dependency on $\Delta$: for constant dimensional Euclidean space, we achieve a solution with cost $O(\log \Delta)\cdot \textrm{OPT}^{\Omega(1)}+\epsilon$ in time $n^{O(1)} \cdot 2^{\text{poly}((\log(\Delta)/\epsilon))}$. Our algorithms are based on a novel geometry-aware analysis of a conditional rounding of the Sherali-Adams LP Hierarchy, allowing us to avoid exponential dependency on the aspect ratio, which would typically result from this rounding.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Diameter on H-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intensively studied Diameter problem is to find the diameter of a given connected graph. We investigate, for the first time in a structured manner, the complexity of Diameter for H-free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain a fixed graph H as an induced subgraph. We first show that if H is not a linear forest with small components, then Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH. For some small linear forests, we do show linear-time algorithms for solving Diameter. For other linear forests H, we make progress towards linear-time algorithms by considering specific diameter values. If H is a linear forest, the maximum value of the diameter of any graph in a connected H-free graph class is some constant dmax dependent only on H. We give linear-time algorithms for deciding if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax, for several linear forests H. In contrast, for one such linear forest H, Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH. Moreover, we even show that, for several other linear forests H, one cannot decide in subquadratic time if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax under SETH.</description>

      <title>IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithm achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we show that this does not extend to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), while it can be extended to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

      <title>Can You Link Up With Treewidth?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a fundamental paper in parameterized complexity theory, Marx [ToC '10] constructed $k$-vertex graphs $H$ of maximum degree $3$ such that $n^{o(k /\log k)}$ time algorithms for detecting colorful $H$-subgraphs would refute the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH). This result is widely used to obtain almost-tight conditional lower bounds for parameterized problems under ETH.
  We give a new and fully self-contained proof of this result that further simplifies a recent work by Karthik et al. [SOSA 2024]. In our proof, we introduce a novel graph parameter of independent interest, the linkage capacity $\gamma(H)$, and show that detecting colorful $H$-subgraphs in time $n^{o(\gamma(H))}$ refutes ETH. Then, we use a simple construction of communication networks credited to Bene\v{s} to obtain $k$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $3$ and linkage capacity $\Omega(k / \log k)$, avoiding arguments involving expander graphs, which were required in previous papers. We also show that every graph $H$ of treewidth $t$ has linkage capacity $\Omega(t / \log t)$, thus recovering a stronger result shown by Marx [ToC '10] with a simplified proof.
  Additionally, we obtain new tight lower bounds on the complexity of colorful subgraph detection for certain types of patterns by analyzing their linkage capacity: We prove that almost all $k$-vertex graphs of polynomial average degree $\Omega(k^{\beta})$ for $\beta &gt; 0$ have linkage capacity $\Theta(k)$, which implies tight lower bounds for finding such patterns $H$. As an application of these results, we also obtain tight lower bounds for counting small induced subgraphs having a fixed property $\Phi$, improving bounds from, e.g., [Roth et al., FOCS 2020].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present RXTX, a new algorithm for computing the product of matrix by its transpose $XX^{t}$ for $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$. RXTX uses $5\%$ fewer multiplications and $5\%$ fewer operations (additions and multiplications) than State-of-the-Art algorithms. Note that the accelerations not only holds asymptotically for large matrices with $n \rightarrow \infty$, but also for small matrices including $n = 4$. The algorithm was discovered by combining Machine Learning-based search methods with Combinatorial Optimization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Finding the Optimal Variable Ordering for Binary Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) is a directed acyclic graph that represents a Boolean function. OBDDs are also known as special cases of oblivious read-once branching programs in the field of complexity theory. Since OBDDs have many nice properties as data structures, they have been extensively studied for decades in both theoretical and practical fields, such as VLSI design, formal verification, machine learning, and combinatorial problems. Arguably, the most crucial problem in using OBDDs is that they may vary exponentially in size depending on their variable ordering (i.e., the order in which the variable are to read) when they represent the same function. Indeed, it is NP hard to find an optimal variable ordering that minimizes an OBDD for a given function. Hence, numerous studies have sought heuristics to find an optimal variable ordering. From practical as well as theoretical points of view, it is also important to seek algorithms that output optimal solutions with lower (exponential) time complexity than trivial brute-force algorithms do. Friedman and Supowit provided a clever deterministic algorithm with time/space complexity $O^\ast(3^n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables of the function, which is much better than the trivial brute-force bound $O^\ast(n!2^n)$. This paper shows that a further speedup is possible with quantum computers by demonstrating the existence of a quantum algorithm that produces a minimum OBDD together with the corresponding variable ordering in $O^\ast(2.77286^n)$ time and space with an exponentially small error. Moreover, this algorithm can be adapted to constructing other minimum decision diagrams such as zero-suppressed BDDs, which provide compact representations of sparse sets and are often used in the field of discrete optimization and enumeration.</description>

      <title>Staying Fresh: Efficient Algorithms for Timely Social Information Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In location-based social networks (LBSNs), users sense urban point-of-interest (PoI) information in the vicinity and share such information with friends in online social networks. Given users' limited social connections and severe lags in disseminating fresh PoI to all, major LBSNs aim to enhance users' social PoI sharing by selecting $k$ out of $m$ users as hotspots and broadcasting their fresh PoI information to the entire user community. This motivates us to study a new combinatorial optimization problem that involves the interplay between an urban sensing network and an online social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and also renders existing approximation solutions not viable. Through analyzing the interplay effects between the two networks, we successfully transform the involved PoI-sharing process across two networks to matrix computations for deriving a closed-form objective to hold desirable properties (e.g., submodularity and monotonicity). This finding enables us to develop a polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees a ($1-\frac{m-2}{m}(\frac{k-1}{k})^k$) approximation of the optimum. Furthermore, we allow each selected user to move around and sense more PoI information to share and propose an augmentation-adaptive algorithm with decent performance guarantees. Finally, our theoretical results are corroborated by our simulation findings using both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Adversary Resilient Learned Bloom Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06556v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A learned Bloom filter (LBF) combines a classical Bloom filter (CBF) with a learning model to reduce the amount of memory needed to represent a given set while achieving a target false positive rate (FPR). Provable security against adaptive adversaries that advertently attempt to increase FPR has been studied for CBFs. However, achieving adaptive security for LBFs is an open problem. In this paper, we close this gap and show how to achieve adaptive security for LBFs. In particular, we define several adaptive security notions capturing varying degrees of adversarial control, including full and partial adaptivity, in addition to LBF extensions of existing adversarial models for CBFs, including the Always-Bet and Bet-or-Pass notions. We propose two secure LBF constructions, PRP-LBF and Cuckoo-LBF, and formally prove their security under these models, assuming the existence of one-way functions. Based on our analysis and use case evaluations, our constructions achieve strong security guarantees while maintaining competitive FPR and memory overhead.</description>

      <title>Faithful universal graphs for minor-closed classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was proved by Huynh, Mohar, \v{S}\'amal, Thomassen and Wood in 2021 that any countable graph containing every countable planar graph as a subgraph has an infinite clique minor. We prove a finite, quantitative version of this result: for fixed $t$, if a graph $G$ is $K_t$-minor-free and contains every $n$-vertex planar graph as a subgraph, then $G$ has $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ vertices. If $G$ contains every $n$-vertex toroidal graph instead, then $G$ has $2^{\Omega(n)}$ vertices. On the other hand, we construct a polynomial size $K_4$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex tree as an induced subgraph, and a polynomial size $K_7$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex $K_4$-minor-free graph as induced subgraph. This answers several problems raised recently by Bergold, Ir\v{s}i\v{c}, Lauff, Orthaber, Scheucher and Wesolek.
  We study more generally the order of universal graphs for various classes (of graphs of bounded degree, treedepth, pathwidth, or treewidth), if the universal graphs retain some of the structure of the original class.</description>

      <title>An $\mathcal{O}(n)$ Space Construction of Superpermutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A superpermutation is a sequence that contains every permutation of $n$ distinct symbols as a contiguous substring. For instance, a valid example for three symbols is a sequence that contains all six permutations. This paper introduces a new algorithm that constructs such sequences more efficiently than existing recursive and graph-theoretic methods. Unlike traditional techniques that suffer from scalability and factorial memory demands, the proposed approach builds superpermutations directly and compactly. This improves memory usage, enabling the construction of larger sequences previously considered impractical.</description>
