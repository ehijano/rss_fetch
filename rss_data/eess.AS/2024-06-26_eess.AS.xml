      <title>E2 TTS: Embarrassingly Easy Fully Non-Autoregressive Zero-Shot TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Embarrassingly Easy Text-to-Speech (E2 TTS), a fully non-autoregressive zero-shot text-to-speech system that offers human-level naturalness and state-of-the-art speaker similarity and intelligibility. In the E2 TTS framework, the text input is converted into a character sequence with filler tokens. The flow-matching-based mel spectrogram generator is then trained based on the audio infilling task. Unlike many previous works, it does not require additional components (e.g., duration model, grapheme-to-phoneme) or complex techniques (e.g., monotonic alignment search). Despite its simplicity, E2 TTS achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS capabilities that are comparable to or surpass previous works, including Voicebox and NaturalSpeech 3. The simplicity of E2 TTS also allows for flexibility in the input representation. We propose several variants of E2 TTS to improve usability during inference. See https://aka.ms/e2tts/ for demo samples.</description>

      <title>On Calibration of Speech Classification Models: Insights from Energy-Based Model Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For speech classification tasks, deep learning models often achieve high accuracy but exhibit shortcomings in calibration, manifesting as classifiers exhibiting overconfidence. The significance of calibration lies in its critical role in guaranteeing the reliability of decision-making within deep learning systems. This study explores the effectiveness of Energy-Based Models in calibrating confidence for speech classification tasks by training a joint EBM integrating a discriminative and a generative model, thereby enhancing the classifiers calibration and mitigating overconfidence. Experimental evaluations conducted on three speech classification tasks specifically: age, emotion, and language recognition. Our findings highlight the competitive performance of EBMs in calibrating the speech classification models. This research emphasizes the potential of EBMs in speech classification tasks, demonstrating their ability to enhance calibration without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>MSR-86K: An Evolving, Multilingual Corpus with 86,300 Hours of Transcribed Audio for Speech Recognition Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multilingual artificial intelligence assistants, exemplified by ChatGPT, have gained immense popularity. As a crucial gateway to human-computer interaction, multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) has also garnered significant attention, as evidenced by systems like Whisper. However, the proprietary nature of the training data has impeded researchers' efforts to study multilingual ASR. This paper introduces MSR-86K, an evolving, large-scale multilingual corpus for speech recognition research. The corpus is derived from publicly accessible videos on YouTube, comprising 15 languages and a total of 86,300 hours of transcribed ASR data. We also introduce how to use the MSR-86K corpus and other open-source corpora to train a robust multilingual ASR model that is competitive with Whisper. MSR-86K will be publicly released on HuggingFace, and we believe that such a large corpus will pave new avenues for research in multilingual ASR.</description>

      <title>Fish Tracking, Counting, and Behaviour Analysis in Digital Aquaculture: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital aquaculture leverages advanced technologies and data-driven methods, providing substantial benefits over traditional aquaculture practices. Fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis are crucial components of digital aquaculture, which are essential for optimizing production efficiency, enhancing fish welfare, and improving resource management. Previous reviews have focused on single modalities, limiting their ability to address the diverse challenges encountered in these tasks comprehensively. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of aquaculture digital technologies, including vision-based, acoustic-based, and biosensor-based methods. We examine the advantages, limitations, and applications of these methods, highlighting recent advancements and identifying critical research gaps. The scarcity of comprehensive fish datasets and the lack of unified evaluation standards, which make it difficult to compare the performance of different technologies, are identified as major obstacles hindering progress in this field. To overcome current limitations and improve the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of fish monitoring systems, we explore the potential of emerging technologies such as multimodal data fusion and deep learning. Additionally, we contribute to the field by providing a summary of existing datasets available for fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis. Future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the need for comprehensive datasets and evaluation standards to facilitate meaningful comparisons between technologies and promote their practical implementation in real-world aquaculture settings.</description>

      <title>A multi-speaker multi-lingual voice cloning system based on vits2 for limmits 2024 challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a speech synthesis system for the LIMMITS'24 Challenge, focusing primarily on Track 2. The objective of the challenge is to establish a multi-speaker, multi-lingual Indic Text-to-Speech system with voice cloning capabilities, covering seven Indian languages with both male and female speakers. The system was trained using challenge data and fine-tuned for few-shot voice cloning on target speakers. Evaluation included both mono-lingual and cross-lingual synthesis across all seven languages, with subjective tests assessing naturalness and speaker similarity. Our system uses the VITS2 architecture, augmented with a multi-lingual ID and a BERT model to enhance contextual language comprehension. In Track 1, where no additional data usage was permitted, our model achieved a Speaker Similarity score of 4.02. In Track 2, which allowed the use of extra data, it attained a Speaker Similarity score of 4.17.</description>

      <title>Automatic speech recognition for the Nepali language using CNN, bidirectional LSTM and ResNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end deep learning model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) that transcribes Nepali speech to text. The model was trained and tested on the OpenSLR (audio, text) dataset. The majority of the audio dataset have silent gaps at both ends which are clipped during dataset preprocessing for a more uniform mapping of audio frames and their corresponding texts. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are used as audio features to feed into the model. The model having Bidirectional LSTM paired with ResNet and one-dimensional CNN produces the best results for this dataset out of all the models (neural networks with variations of LSTM, GRU, CNN, and ResNet) that have been trained so far. This novel model uses Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) function for loss calculation during training and CTC beam search decoding for predicting characters as the most likely sequence of Nepali text. On the test dataset, the character error rate (CER) of 17.06 percent has been achieved.

      <title>FASA: a Flexible and Automatic Speech Aligner for Extracting High-quality Aligned Children Speech Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for adults' speeches has made significant progress by employing deep neural network (DNN) models recently, but improvement in children's speech is still unsatisfactory due to children's speech's distinct characteristics. DNN models pre-trained on adult data often struggle in generalizing children's speeches with fine tuning because of the lack of high-quality aligned children's speeches. When generating datasets, human annotations are not scalable, and existing forced-alignment tools are not usable as they make impractical assumptions about the quality of the input transcriptions. To address these challenges, we propose a new forced-alignment tool, FASA, as a flexible and automatic speech aligner to extract high-quality aligned children's speech data from many of the existing noisy children's speech data. We demonstrate its usage on the CHILDES dataset and show that FASA can improve data quality by 13.6$\times$ over human annotations.</description>

      <title>SonicSense: Object Perception from In-Hand Acoustic Vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SonicSense, a holistic design of hardware and software to enable rich robot object perception through in-hand acoustic vibration sensing. While previous studies have shown promising results with acoustic sensing for object perception, current solutions are constrained to a handful of objects with simple geometries and homogeneous materials, single-finger sensing, and mixing training and testing on the same objects. SonicSense enables container inventory status differentiation, heterogeneous material prediction, 3D shape reconstruction, and object re-identification from a diverse set of 83 real-world objects. Our system employs a simple but effective heuristic exploration policy to interact with the objects as well as end-to-end learning-based algorithms to fuse vibration signals to infer object properties. Our framework underscores the significance of in-hand acoustic vibration sensing in advancing robot tactile perception.</description>

      <title>Sequential Editing for Lifelong Training of Speech Recognition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) traditionally assumes known domains, but adding data from a new domain raises concerns about computational inefficiencies linked to retraining models on both existing and new domains. Fine-tuning solely on new domain risks Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). To address this, Lifelong Learning (LLL) algorithms have been proposed for ASR. Prior research has explored techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation, Knowledge Distillation, and Replay, all of which necessitate either additional parameters or access to prior domain data. We propose Sequential Model Editing as a novel method to continually learn new domains in ASR systems. Different than previous methods, our approach does not necessitate access to prior datasets or the introduction of extra parameters. Our study demonstrates up to 15% Word Error Rate Reduction (WERR) over fine-tuning baseline, and superior efficiency over other LLL techniques on CommonVoice English multi-accent dataset.</description>

      <title>Improving Robustness of LLM-based Speech Synthesis by Learning Monotonic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based text-to-speech (TTS) systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling large speech datasets and generating natural speech for new speakers. However, LLM-based TTS models are not robust as the generated output can contain repeating words, missing words and mis-aligned speech (referred to as hallucinations or attention errors), especially when the text contains multiple occurrences of the same token. We examine these challenges in an encoder-decoder transformer model and find that certain cross-attention heads in such models implicitly learn the text and speech alignment when trained for predicting speech tokens for a given text. To make the alignment more robust, we propose techniques utilizing CTC loss and attention priors that encourage monotonic cross-attention over the text tokens. Our guided attention training technique does not introduce any new learnable parameters and significantly improves robustness of LLM-based TTS models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Switch-Conformer-based MoE system named SC-MoE for unified streaming and non-streaming code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR), where we design a streaming MoE layer consisting of three language experts, which correspond to Mandarin, English, and blank, respectively, and equipped with a language identification (LID) network with a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss as a router in the encoder of SC-MoE to achieve a real-time streaming CS ASR system. To further utilize the language information embedded in text, we also incorporate MoE layers into the decoder of SC-MoE. In addition, we introduce routers into every MoE layer of the encoder and the decoder and achieve better recognition performance. Experimental results show that the SC-MoE significantly improves CS ASR performances over baseline with comparable computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Exploring Energy-Based Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Dialect Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diverse nature of dialects presents challenges for models trained on specific linguistic patterns, rendering them susceptible to errors when confronted with unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This study introduces a novel margin-enhanced joint energy model (MEJEM) tailored specifically for OOD detection in dialects. By integrating a generative model and the energy margin loss, our approach aims to enhance the robustness of dialect identification systems. Furthermore, we explore two OOD scores for OOD dialect detection, and our findings conclusively demonstrate that the energy score outperforms the softmax score. Leveraging Sharpness-Aware Minimization to optimize the training process of the joint model, we enhance model generalization by minimizing both loss and sharpness. Experiments conducted on dialect identification tasks validate the efficacy of Energy-Based Models and provide valuable insights into their performance.</description>

Abstract: Opinion Expression Identification (OEI) is essential in NLP for applications ranging from voice assistants to depression diagnosis. This study extends OEI to encompass multimodal inputs, underlining the significance of auditory cues in delivering emotional subtleties beyond the capabilities of text. We introduce a novel multimodal OEI (MOEI) task, integrating text and speech to mirror real-world scenarios. Utilizing CMU MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets, we construct the CI-MOEI dataset. Additionally, Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology is applied to the MPQA dataset to obtain the CIM-OEI dataset. We design a template for the OEI task to take full advantage of the generative power of large language models (LLMs). Advancing further, we propose an LLM-driven method STOEI, which combines speech and text modal to identify opinion expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that MOEI significantly improves the performance while our method outperforms existing methods by 9.20\% and obtains SOTA results.</description>

      <title>A Study on Synthesizing Expressive Violin Performances: Approaches and Comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressive music synthesis (EMS) for violin performance is a challenging task due to the disagreement among music performers in the interpretation of expressive musical terms (EMTs), scarcity of labeled recordings, and limited generalization ability of the synthesis model. These challenges create trade-offs between model effectiveness, diversity of generated results, and controllability of the synthesis system, making it essential to conduct a comparative study on EMS model design. This paper explores two violin EMS approaches. The end-to-end approach is a modification of a state-of-the-art text-to-speech generator. The parameter-controlled approach is based on a simple parameter sampling process that can render note lengths and other parameters compatible with MIDI-DDSP. We study these two approaches (in total, three model variants) through objective and subjective experiments and discuss several key issues of EMS based on the results.</description>

      <title>Token-Weighted RNN-T for Learning from Flawed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ASR models are commonly trained with the cross-entropy criterion to increase the probability of a target token sequence. While optimizing the probability of all tokens in the target sequence is sensible, one may want to de-emphasize tokens that reflect transcription errors. In this work, we propose a novel token-weighted RNN-T criterion that augments the RNN-T objective with token-specific weights. The new objective is used for mitigating accuracy loss from transcriptions errors in the training data, which naturally appear in two settings: pseudo-labeling and human annotation errors. Experiments results show that using our method for semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels leads to a consistent accuracy improvement, up to 38% relative. We also analyze the accuracy degradation resulting from different levels of WER in the reference transcription, and show that token-weighted RNN-T is suitable for overcoming this degradation, recovering 64%-99% of the accuracy loss.</description>

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a key area in computational linguistics, focusing on developing technologies that enable computers to convert spoken language into text. This field combines linguistics and machine learning. ASR models, which map speech audio to transcripts through supervised learning, require handling real and unrestricted text. Text-to-speech systems directly work with real text, while ASR systems rely on language models trained on large text corpora. High-quality transcribed data is essential for training predictive models. The research involved two main components: developing a web application and designing a web interface for speech recognition. The web application, created with JavaScript and Node.js, manages large volumes of audio files and their transcriptions, facilitating collaborative human correction of ASR transcripts. It operates in real-time using a client-server architecture. The web interface for speech recognition records 16 kHz mono audio from any device running the web app, performs voice activity detection (VAD), and sends the audio to the recognition engine. VAD detects human speech presence, aiding efficient speech processing and reducing unnecessary processing during non-speech intervals, thus saving computation and network bandwidth in VoIP applications. The final phase of the research tested a neural network for accurately aligning the speech signal to hidden Markov model (HMM) states. This included implementing a novel backpropagation method that utilizes prior statistics of node co-activations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate recognition of aviation commands is vital for flight safety and efficiency, as pilots must follow air traffic control instructions precisely. This paper addresses challenges in speech command recognition, such as noisy environments and limited computational resources, by advancing keyword spotting technology. We create a dataset of standardized airport tower commands, including routine and emergency instructions. We enhance broadcasted residual learning with squeeze-and-excitation and time-frame frequency-wise squeeze-and-excitation techniques, resulting in our BC-SENet model. This model focuses on crucial information with fewer parameters. Our tests on five keyword spotting models, including BC-SENet, demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our model advancements in improving speech command recognition for aviation safety and efficiency in noisy, high-stakes environments. Additionally, BC-SENet shows comparable performance on the common Google Speech Command dataset.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Data Pruning for Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is largely attributed to the ever-growing amount of training data. However, this trend has made model training prohibitively costly and imposed computational demands. While data pruning has been proposed to mitigate this issue by identifying a small subset of relevant data, its application in ASR has been barely explored, and existing works often entail significant overhead to achieve meaningful results. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first investigation of dynamic data pruning for ASR, finding that we can reach the full-data performance by dynamically selecting 70% of data. Furthermore, we introduce Dynamic Data Pruning for ASR (DDP-ASR), which offers several fine-grained pruning granularities specifically tailored for speech-related datasets, going beyond the conventional pruning of entire time sequences. Our intensive experiments show that DDP-ASR can save up to 1.6x training time with negligible performance loss.</description>

      <title>MFSN: Multi-perspective Fusion Search Network For Pre-training Knowledge in Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is an important research topic in human-computer interaction. Many recent works focus on directly extracting emotional cues through pre-trained knowledge, frequently overlooking considerations of appropriateness and comprehensiveness. Therefore, we propose a novel framework for pre-training knowledge in SER, called Multi-perspective Fusion Search Network (MFSN). Considering comprehensiveness, we partition speech knowledge into Textual-related Emotional Content (TEC) and Speech-related Emotional Content (SEC), capturing cues from both semantic and acoustic perspectives, and we design a new architecture search space to fully leverage them. Considering appropriateness, we verify the efficacy of different modeling approaches in capturing SEC and fills the gap in current research. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of MFSN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative speech models based on audio-text prompts have enabled remarkable innovations like high-quality zero-shot text-to-speech. However, existing models still face limitations in handling diverse audio-text speech generation tasks involving transforming input speech and processing audio captured in adverse acoustic conditions. This paper introduces SpeechX, a versatile speech generation model capable of zero-shot TTS and various speech transformation tasks, dealing with both clean and noisy signals. SpeechX combines neural codec language modeling with multi-task learning using task-dependent prompting, enabling unified and extensible modeling and providing a consistent way for leveraging textual input in speech enhancement and transformation tasks. Experimental results show SpeechX's efficacy in various tasks, including zero-shot TTS, noise suppression, target speaker extraction, speech removal, and speech editing with or without background noise, achieving comparable or superior performance to specialized models across tasks. See https://aka.ms/speechx for demo samples.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Voice Anonymization on Speech Diagnostic Applications: a Case Study on COVID-19 Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With advances seen in deep learning, voice-based applications are burgeoning, ranging from personal assistants, affective computing, to remote disease diagnostics. As the voice contains both linguistic and para-linguistic information (e.g., vocal pitch, intonation, speech rate, loudness), there is growing interest in voice anonymization to preserve speaker privacy and identity. Voice privacy challenges have emerged over the last few years and focus has been placed on removing speaker identity while keeping linguistic content intact. For affective computing and disease monitoring applications, however, the para-linguistic content may be more critical. Unfortunately, the effects that anonymization may have on these systems are still largely unknown. In this paper, we fill this gap and focus on one particular health monitoring application: speech-based COVID-19 diagnosis. We test three anonymization methods and their impact on five different state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnostic systems using three public datasets. We validate the effectiveness of the anonymization methods, compare their computational complexity, and quantify the impact across different testing scenarios for both within- and across-dataset conditions. Additionally, we provided a comprehensive evaluation of the importance of different speech aspects for diagnostics and showed how they are affected by different types of anonymizers. Lastly, we show the benefits of using anonymized external data as a data augmentation tool to help recover some of the COVID-19 diagnostic accuracy loss seen with anonymization.</description>

      <title>WhaleNet: a Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Marine Mammals Vocalizations on Watkins Marine Mammal Sound Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marine mammal communication is a complex field, hindered by the diversity of vocalizations and environmental factors. The Watkins Marine Mammal Sound Database (WMMD) constitutes a comprehensive labeled dataset employed in machine learning applications. Nevertheless, the methodologies for data preparation, preprocessing, and classification documented in the literature exhibit considerable variability and are typically not applied to the dataset in its entirety. This study initially undertakes a concise review of the state-of-the-art benchmarks pertaining to the dataset, with a particular focus on clarifying data preparation and preprocessing techniques. Subsequently, we explore the utilization of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) and Mel spectrogram as preprocessing mechanisms for feature extraction. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{WhaleNet} (Wavelet Highly Adaptive Learning Ensemble Network), a sophisticated deep ensemble architecture for the classification of marine mammal vocalizations, leveraging both WST and Mel spectrogram for enhanced feature discrimination. By integrating the insights derived from WST and Mel representations, we achieved an improvement in classification accuracy by $8-10\%$ over existing architectures, corresponding to a classification accuracy of $97.61\%$.</description>

      <title>Compact Speech Translation Models via Discrete Speech Units Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a pretraining method to use Self-Supervised Speech (SSS) model to creating more compact Speech-to-text Translation. In contrast to using the SSS model for initialization, our method is more suitable to memory constrained scenario such as on-device deployment. Our method is based on Discrete Speech Units (DSU) extracted from the SSS model. In the first step, our method pretrains two smaller encoder-decoder models on 1) Filterbank-to-DSU (Fbk-to-DSU) and 2) DSU-to-Translation (DSU-to-Trl) data respectively. The DSU thus become the distillation inputs of the smaller models. Subsequently, the encoder from the Fbk-to-DSU model and the decoder from the DSU-to-Trl model are taken to initialise the compact model. Finally, the compact model is finetuned on the paired Fbk-Trl data. In addition to being compact, our method requires no transcripts, making it applicable to low-resource settings. It also avoids speech discretization in inference and is more robust to the DSU tokenization. Evaluation on CoVoST-2 (X-En) shows that our method has consistent improvement over the baseline in three metrics while being compact i.e., only half the SSS model size.</description>

      <title>Generating Music with Structure Using Self-Similarity as Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the innovations in deep learning and generative AI, creating long term structure as well as the layers of repeated structure common in musical works remains an open challenge in music generation. We propose an attention layer that uses a novel approach applying user-supplied self-similarity matrices to previous time steps, and demonstrate it in our Similarity Incentivized Neural Generator (SING) system, a deep learning autonomous music generation system with two layers. The first is a vanilla Long Short Term Memory layer, and the second is the proposed attention layer. During generation, this attention mechanism imposes a suggested structure from a template piece on the generated music. We train SING on the MAESTRO dataset using a novel variable batching method, and compare its performance to the same model without the attention mechanism. The addition of our proposed attention mechanism significantly improves the network's ability to replicate specific structures, and it performs better on an unseen test set than a model without the attention mechanism.</description>

      <title>AND: Audio Network Dissection for Interpreting Deep Acoustic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuron-level interpretations aim to explain network behaviors and properties by investigating neurons responsive to specific perceptual or structural input patterns. Although there is emerging work in the vision and language domains, none is explored for acoustic models. To bridge the gap, we introduce $\textit{AND}$, the first $\textbf{A}$udio $\textbf{N}$etwork $\textbf{D}$issection framework that automatically establishes natural language explanations of acoustic neurons based on highly-responsive audio. $\textit{AND}$ features the use of LLMs to summarize mutual acoustic features and identities among audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify $\textit{AND}$'s precise and informative descriptions. In addition, we demonstrate a potential use of $\textit{AND}$ for audio machine unlearning by conducting concept-specific pruning based on the generated descriptions. Finally, we highlight two acoustic model behaviors with analysis by $\textit{AND}$: (i) models discriminate audio with a combination of basic acoustic features rather than high-level abstract concepts; (ii) training strategies affect model behaviors and neuron interpretability -- supervised training guides neurons to gradually narrow their attention, while self-supervised learning encourages neurons to be polysemantic for exploring high-level features.</description>

      <title>SpecMaskGIT: Masked Generative Modeling of Audio Spectrograms for Efficient Audio Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models that iteratively synthesize audio clips sparked great success to text-to-audio synthesis (TTA), but with the cost of slow synthesis speed and heavy computation. Although there have been attempts to accelerate the iterative procedure, high-quality TTA systems remain inefficient due to hundreds of iterations required in the inference phase and large amount of model parameters. To address the challenges, we propose SpecMaskGIT, a light-weighted, efficient yet effective TTA model based on the masked generative modeling of spectrograms. First, SpecMaskGIT synthesizes a realistic 10s audio clip by less than 16 iterations, an order-of-magnitude less than previous iterative TTA methods. As a discrete model, SpecMaskGIT outperforms larger VQ-Diffusion and auto-regressive models in the TTA benchmark, while being real-time with only 4 CPU cores or even 30x faster with a GPU. Next, built upon a latent space of Mel-spectrogram, SpecMaskGIT has a wider range of applications (e.g., the zero-shot bandwidth extension) than similar methods built on the latent wave domain. Moreover, we interpret SpecMaskGIT as a generative extension to previous discriminative audio masked Transformers, and shed light on its audio representation learning potential. We hope our work inspires the exploration of masked audio modeling toward further diverse scenarios.</description>
