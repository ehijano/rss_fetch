      <title>The Redundancy Matrix as a Performance Indicator for Structural Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of static indeterminacy and its spatial distribution characterize load-bearing structures independent of a specific load case. The redundancy matrix stores the distribution of the static indeterminacy on its main diagonal, and thereby offers the possibility to use this property for the assessment of structures. It is especially suitable to be used in early planning stages for design exploration. In this paper, performance indicators with respect to robustness and assemblability are derived from the redundancy matrix. For each of the performance indicators, a detailed matrix-based derivation is given and the application is showcased with various truss examples.</description>

      <title>SPERO: Simultaneous Power/EM Side-channel Dataset Using Real-time and Oscilloscope Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptosystem implementations often disclose information regarding a secret key due to correlations with side channels such as power consumption, timing variations, and electromagnetic emissions. Since power and EM channels can leak distinct information, the combination of EM and power channels could increase side-channel attack efficiency. In this paper, we develop a miniature dual-channel side-channel detection platform, named RASCv3 to successfully extract subkeys from both unmasked and masked AES modules. For the unmasked AES, we combine EM and power channels by using mutual information to extract the secret key in real-time mode and the experiment result shows that less measurements-to-disclosure (MTD) is used than the last version (RASCv2). Further, we adopt RASCv3 to collect EM/Power traces from the masked AES module and successfully extract the secret key from the masked AES module in fewer power/EM/dual channel traces. In the end, we generate an ASCAD format dataset named SPERO, which consists of EM and power traces collected simultaneously during unmasked/masked AES module doing encryption and upload to the community for future use.</description>

      <title>Scalable physical source-to-field inference with hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generative model that amortises computation for the field around e.g. gravitational or magnetic sources. Exact numerical calculation has either computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(M\times{}N)$ in the number of sources and field evaluation points, or requires a fixed evaluation grid to exploit fast Fourier transforms. Using an architecture where a hypernetwork produces an implicit representation of the field around a source collection, our model instead performs as $\mathcal{O}(M + N)$, achieves accuracy of $\sim\!4\%-6\%$, and allows evaluation at arbitrary locations for arbitrary numbers of sources, greatly increasing the speed of e.g. physics simulations. We also examine a model relating to the physical properties of the output field and develop two-dimensional examples to demonstrate its application. The code for these models and experiments is available at https://github.com/cmt-dtu-energy/hypermagnetics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Enhanced Machine Learning: a position paper for dynamical systems investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position paper takes a broad look at Physics-Enhanced Machine Learning (PEML) -- also known as Scientific Machine Learning -- with particular focus to those PEML strategies developed to tackle dynamical systems' challenges. The need to go beyond Machine Learning (ML) strategies is driven by: (i) limited volume of informative data, (ii) avoiding accurate-but-wrong predictions; (iii) dealing with uncertainties; (iv) providing Explainable and Interpretable inferences. A general definition of PEML is provided by considering four physics and domain knowledge biases, and three broad groups of PEML approaches are discussed: physics-guided, physics-encoded and physics-informed. The advantages and challenges in developing PEML strategies for guiding high-consequence decision making in engineering applications involving complex dynamical systems, are presented.</description>

      <title>Learning from String Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Universal Similarity Metric (USM) has been demonstrated to give practically useful measures of "similarity" between sequence data. Here we have used the USM as an alternative distance metric in a K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) learner to allow effective pattern recognition of variable length sequence data. We compare this USM approach with the commonly used string-to-word vector approach. Our experiments have used two data sets of divergent domains: (1) spam email filtering and (2) protein subcellular localization. Our results with this data reveal that the USM-based K-NN learner (1) gives predictions with higher classification accuracy than those output by techniques that use the string-to-word vector approach, and (2) can be used to generate reliable probability forecasts.</description>

      <title>A resource-efficient variational quantum algorithm for mRNA codon optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the mRNA codon has an essential impact on gene expression for a specific target protein. It is an NP-hard problem; thus, exact solutions to such optimization problems become computationally intractable for realistic problem sizes on both classical and quantum computers. However, approximate solutions via heuristics can substantially impact the application they enable. Quantum approximate optimization is an alternative computation paradigm promising for tackling such problems. Recently, there has been some research in quantum algorithms for bioinformatics, specifically for mRNA codon optimization. This research presents a denser way to encode codons for implementing mRNA codon optimization via the variational quantum eigensolver algorithms on a gate-based quantum computer. This reduces the qubit requirement by half compared to the existing quantum approach, thus allowing longer sequences to be executed on existing quantum processors. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing its results to exact solutions, showing well-matching results.</description>
