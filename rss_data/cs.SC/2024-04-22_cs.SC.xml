      <title>On Modeling Multi-Criteria Decision Making with Uncertain Information using Probabilistic Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making processes often involve dealing with uncertainty, which is traditionally addressed through probabilistic models. However, in practical scenarios, assessing probabilities reliably can be challenging, compounded by diverse perceptions of probabilistic information among decision makers. To address this variability and accommodate diverse preferences regarding uncertainty, we introduce the Probabilistic Abstract Decision Framework (PADF). PADF offers a structured approach for reasoning across different decision criteria, encompassing the optimistic, pessimistic, and Laplace perspectives, each tailored to distinct perceptions of uncertainty. We illustrate how PADF facilitates the computation of optimal decisions aligned with these criteria by leveraging probabilistic rules. Furthermore, we present strategies for optimizing the computational efficiency of these rules, leveraging appropriate independence assumptions to navigate the extensive search space inherent in PADF. Through these contributions, our framework provides a robust and adaptable tool for effectively navigating the complexities of decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Proceedings 18th International Workshop on Logical and Semantic Frameworks, with Applications and 10th Workshop on Horn Clauses for Verification and Synthesis</title>

Abstract: This volume contains
  * The post-proceedings of the Eighteenth Logical and Semantic Frameworks with Applications (LSFA 2023). The meeting was held on July 1-2, 2023, organised by the Sapienza Universit\`a di Roma, Italy. LSFA aims to bring researchers and students interested in theoretical and practical aspects of logical and semantic frameworks and their applications. The covered topics include proof theory, type theory and rewriting theory, specification and deduction languages, and formal semantics of languages and systems.
  * The post-proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Horn clauses for Verification and Synthesis (HCVS 2023). The meeting was held on April 23, 2023 at the Institut Henri Poincar\'e in Paris. HCVS aims to bring together researchers working in the two communities of constraint/ logic programming (e.g., ICLP and CP), program verification (e.g., CAV, TACAS, and VMCAI), and automated deduction (e.g., CADE, IJCAR), on the topics of Horn clause based analysis, verification, and synthesis.</description>
