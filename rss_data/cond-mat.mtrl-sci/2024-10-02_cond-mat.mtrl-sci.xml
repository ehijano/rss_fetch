      <title>Crystal valley Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-reversal symmetry is thought to be a necessary condition for realizing valley Hall effect. If the time-reversal symmetry is broken, whether the valley Hall effect can be realized has not been explored. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$. Due to crystal symmetry required, the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry is called crystal vally Hall effect. In addition, under uniaxial strain, both monolayer Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$ can realize piezomagnetic effect. Under biaxial compressive stress, both monolayer Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$ will transform from altermagnetic semiconductor phase to bipolarized topological Weyl semimetal phase. Our work not only provides a new direction for exploring the novel valley Hall effect, but also provides a good platform for exploring altermagnetic semiconductors and altermagnetic topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Giant and Tunable Bosonic Quantum Interference Induced by Two-Dimensional Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum interference among bosons provides significant opportunities as bosons often carry longer coherence time than fermions. As an example of quantum interference, Fano resonance involving phonons or photons describes the coupling between discrete and continuous states, signified by an asymmetric spectral lineshape. Utilizing photon-based Fano resonance, molecule sensing with ultra-high sensitivity and ultrafast optical switching has been realized. However, phonon-based Fano resonance, which would expand the application space to a vaster regime, has been less exploited because of the weak coupling between discrete phonons with continuous states such as electronic continuum. In this work, we report the discovery of giant phonon-based Fano resonance in a graphene/2D Ag/SiC heterostructure. The Fano asymmetry, being proportional to the coupling strength, exceeds prior reports by two orders of magnitude. This Fano asymmetry arises from simultaneous frequency and lifetime matching between discrete and continuous phonons of SiC. The introduction of 2D Ag layers restructures SiC at the interface and facilitates resonant scattering to further enhance the Fano asymmetry, which is not achievable with conventional Ag thin films. With these unique properties, we demonstrated that the phonon-based Fano resonance can be used for ultrasensitive molecule detection at the single-molecule level. Our work highlights strong Fano resonance in the phononic system, opening avenues for engineering quantum interference based on bosons. Further, our findings provide opportunities for advancing phonon-related applications, including biochemical sensing, quantum transduction, and superconductor-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Simplified approach to estimate Lorenz number using experimental Seebeck coefficient for non parabolic band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is one of the most effective ways of improving thermoelectric properties. However extraction of $\kappa_L$ from the total measured thermal conductivity can be misleading if Lorenz ($L$) number is not estimated correctly. The $\kappa_L$ is obtained using Wiedemann-Franz law which estimates electronic part of thermal conductivity $\kappa_e$ = $L$$\sigma$T where, $\sigma$ and T are electrical conductivity and temperature. The $\kappa_L$ is then estimated as $\kappa_L$ = $\kappa_T$ - $L$$\sigma$T. For the metallic system the Lorenz number has universal value of 2.44 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ W$\Omega$K$^{-2}$ (degenerate limit), but for no-degenerate semiconductors, the value can deviate significantly for acoustic phonon scattering, the most common scattering mechanism for thermoelectric above room temperatures. Up till now, $L$ is estimated by solving a series of equation derived form Boltzmann transport equations. For the single parabolic band (SPB) an equation was proposed to estimate $L$ directly from the experimental Seebeck coefficient. However using SPB model will lead to overestimation of $L$ in case of low band gap semiconductors which result in underestimation of $\kappa_L$ sometimes even negative $\kappa_L$. In this letter we propose a simpler equation to estimate $L$ for a non parabolic band. Experimental Seebeck coefficient, band gap($E_g$), and Temperature ($T$) are the main inputs in the equation which nearly eliminates the need of solving multiple Fermi integrals besides giving accurate values of $L$.</description>

      <title>Study of the symmetry of electronic system of the Weyl semimetal GdBiPt using rotational anisotropy of second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The half-Heusler compound GdBiPt orders antiferromagnetically around $T_\mathrm{N}=8.5$ K which implies breaking the time reversal symmetry as well as the translational symmetry. This combination preserves the global symmetry. Here, we used rotational anisotropy of second harmonic generation (SHG) to study the symmetry changes associated with this phase transition. GdBiPt crystallizes in the space group $F\overline{4}3m$, which does not change through the phase transition. From powder neutron diffraction, the proposed magnetic point group for the magnetic unit cell is $3m$. We carried out a symmetry analysis of the SHG patterns. Above \tn, the SHG data shows a $C_2$ symmetry which excludes the point group $\overline{4}3m$, as well as the $3m$ point group which represents a $[1 1 1]$ facet of the sample. Thus, we considered the point groups $2$ and $m$, but we have to reject the first one as the associated tensor elements poorly represent the angular dependence SHG. Finally, a superposition consisting of the point groups $3m$ and $m$ fit the data correctly. Below \tn, we had to add a third contribution associated with magnetic points group $m'$ in order to properly describe the SHG signal. The SHG intensity is linearly proportional to the antiferromagnetic order parameter. This allows us to determine $T_\mathrm{N}=9.61\pm0.48$ K and a critical exponent $\beta=0.346\pm0.017$, which are in agreement with the values found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the electronic structure of Th:CaF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work investigates properties of local electronic states in thorium-doped CaF$_2$ crystals using multiconfigurational quantum chemistry methods. Th:CaF$_2$ is currently establishing as a solid-state nuclear clock, making use of the laser-accessible isomeric state in thorium-229. We compare the simulated absorption spectra of a library of defect configurations with experimental data, demonstrating the impact of fluorine vacancies and calcium vacancies on the Th:CaF$_2$ electronic structure. Our results indicate that fluorine-deficient sites can introduce local electronic states within the band gap, resonant with the isomer energy, which may contribute to non-radiative decay or quenching of the Th-229 isomer. We explore the potential of electron-nuclear bridge mechanisms to enhance nuclear excitation or de-excitation, offering a pathway for more efficient control over the nuclear clock. This study provides crucial guidelines for optimizing the crystal environment for nuclear metrology applications and opens avenues for further experimental and theoretical exploration of thorium-doped ionic crystals.</description>

      <title>Operando Ultrafast Damage-free Diffraction-Enhanced X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy for Chemical Reactivity of Polymer in Solvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical recycling of plastics to its constituent monomers is a promising solution to develop a sustainable circular plastic economy. An in-situ X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) characterization is an important way to understand the deconstruction process. However, radiation damage, and long acquisition time, prevent such characterization for fast chemical process. Here, we present a novel experimental technique, which we name Diffraction-Enhanced X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (DE-XAS), where the plastic material is supported on a graphene layer covering a periodic pattern of holes in a perforated SiNx membrane. The XAS is obtained by measuring the energy-dependent intensity of the X-ray diffracted beams going through the plastic film over the holes in the SiNx membrane. Our method decreases beam damage by orders of magnitude while providing good signal/noise ratio data. We demonstrate the suppression of beam damage with samples of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and the operando characterization of polymer deconstruction process in acid with polydiketoenamine (PDK). This proof-of-concept of the DE-XAS technique shows its great potential for studying fast chemical processes, picoseconds to nanoseconds, using fast CCD detectors with short readout time. We believe the DE-XAS technique offers opportunities for studies of chemical reactions, e.g., photoresist, and many others.</description>

Abstract: Exploring how mechanical strain can modify the magnetic properties of low-dimensional structures is one of the priorities of straintronics, an area in condensed matter physics. It has been proven by calculating the parameters of magnetic interactions Jij and developing structural/magnetic models of the layered dichalcogenides MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2 and layered double hydroxides (M2+)6Al3(OH)18[Na(H2O)6](SO4)2 6H2O (M2+ = Mn2+, Fe2+) with a grapheme type structure that magnetic interactions are responsive to the mechanical deformation of their crystal structure. As turned out, the ions in these antiferromagnetic materials are situated in the hexagonal planes close to critical positions. We have thus demonstrated that the fluctuations of the intermediate ions near critical positions due to mechanical strain cause dramatic changes to the magnetic parameters and allow the magnetic properties to be modified by mechanical strain. To be sure, an abundant class of new 2D materials transition-metal-based double hydroxides, whose properties are similar to those of molybdenum-based chalcogenides have promise as materials to be used in straintronics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel CaV1-xWxO3 (0.1 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.33) oxides with an orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure of GdFeO3 type have been synthesized. These compounds contain in B-position W6+ and V cations in an oxidation state between 4+ (CaVO3) and 3+ (x=0.33). CaV0.9W0.1O3 compound possesses metallic type of conductivity and Pauli paramagnetism. The intermediate compositions are between bad metal and semiconducting type of behavior with paramagnetic response. CaV0.67W0.33O3 is a Mott insulator with localized V3+ moments coupled by strong antiferromagnetic interactions. It demonstrates the reduction of effective magnetic moment at high temperatures and canonical spin glass state formation with the freezing temperature Tg = 27.5 K seen in dc - and ac - magnetic susceptibility. Disorder in the magnetic subsystem induces a broad Schottky type anomaly in magnetic contribution of the heat capacity at Tmax = 34 K.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient picosecond spin-orbit torque magnetization switching in ferro- and ferrimagnetic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical current pulses can be used to manipulate magnetization efficiently via spin-orbit torques (SOTs). Pulse durations as short as a few picoseconds have been used to switch the magnetization of ferromagnetic films, reaching the THz regime. However, little is known about the reversal mechanisms and energy requirements in the ultrafast switching regime. In this work, we quantify the energy cost for magnetization reversal over 7 orders of magnitude in pulse duration, in both ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic samples, bridging quasi-static spintronics and femtomagnetism. To this end, we develop a method to stretch picosecond pulses generated by a photoconductive switch by an order of magnitude. Thereby, we can create current pulses from picoseconds to durations approaching pulse width available with commercial instruments. We show that the energy cost for SOT switching decreases by more than an order of magnitude in all samples when the pulse duration enters the picosecond range. We project an energy cost of 9 fJ for a 100 x 100 nm 2 ferrimagnetic device. Micromagnetic and macrospin simulations unveil a transition from a non-coherent to a coherent magnetization reversal with a strong modification of the magnetization dynamical trajectories as pulse duration is reduced. Our results cement the potential for high-speed magnetic spin-orbit torque memories and highlights alternative magnetization reversal pathways at fast time scales.</description>

      <title>Exploring the complex interplay of anisotropies in magnetosomes of magnetotactic bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are of significant interest for biophysical applications, particularly in cancer treatment. The biomineralized magnetosomes produced by these bacteria are high-quality magnetic nanoparticles that form chains through a highly reproducible natural process. Specifically, Magnetovibrio blakemorei and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense exhibit distinct magnetosome morphologies: truncated hexa-octahedral and truncated octahedral shapes, respectively. Despite having identical compositions (magnetite, Fe3O4) and comparable dimensions, their effective uniaxial anisotropies differ significantly, with M. blakemorei showing ~25 kJ/m^3 and M. gryphiswaldense ~11 kJ/m^3 at 300K. This variation presents a unique opportunity to explore the role of different anisotropy contributions in the magnetic responses of magnetite-based nanoparticles. This study systematically investigates these responses by examining static magnetization as a function of temperature (M vs. T, 5 mT) and magnetic field (M vs. H, up to 1 T). Above the Verwey transition temperature (110 K), the effective anisotropy is dominated by shape anisotropy, notably increasing coercivity for M. blakemorei by up to two-fold compared to M. gryphiswaldense. Below this temperature, the effective uniaxial anisotropy increases non-monotonically, significantly altering magnetic behavior. Our simulations based on dynamic Stoner-Wohlfarth models indicate that below the Verwey temperature, a uniaxial magnetocrystalline contribution emerges, peaking at ~22-24 kJ/m^3 at 5 K, values close to those of bulk magnetite. This demonstrates the profound impact of anisotropic properties on the magnetic behaviors and applications of magnetite-based nanoparticles and highlights the exceptional utility of magnetosomes as ideal model systems for studying the complex interplay of anisotropies in magnetite-based nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Modulating the magnetic properties of Fe3C/C encapsulated core/shell nanoparticles for potential prospects in biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of alternative and less invasive medical treatments, magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) have gained significant relevance. Iron carbides NPs stand out for their higher saturation magnetizations compared to iron oxides, while maintaining a suitable biocompatibility. In this work, high control is achieved over the composition and morphology of Fe3C/C encapsulated core/shell nanoparticles through fine-tuning of the sol-gel synthesis parameters. Specifically, the impact of decreasing each surfactant concentration added, nt, the same both for oleylamine (ON) and oleic acid (OA), has been explored. A minimum value for such parameter denoted by nt,min. was required to produce pure Fe3C@C NP-composites. For nt &lt; 4 mmol, some minor {\alpha}-Fe impurities arise, and the effective carburization becomes unstable due to insufficient carbon. The magnetic properties of the materials prepared were optimized by reducing the excess carbon from surfactants, resulting in saturation magnetization values of 86 emu/g. (for pure Fe3C at nt = 5 mmol) and 102 emu/g (for Fe3C and &lt;2 % w.t. of {\alpha}-Fe impurity at nt = 4 mmol). In view of this, several cytotoxicity studies for different Fe3C@C samples were conducted, exhibiting excellent biocompatibility in cell-based assays, which could lead to potential application at the forefront of biomedical fields.</description>

      <title>Growth Engineering of SrNbO3 Perovskite Oxide by Pulsed Laser Deposition and Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a state-of-the-art technique for depositing thin films with precise stoichiometric control. However, when depositing oxides of perovskite-type ABO3, this process becomes challenging as controlling the flux rate of A and B simultaneously in the presence of oxygen is difficult. In this work, by utilizing e-beam-assisted oxide MBE, we successfully deposited SrNbO3 epitaxial thin films. A buffer layer of SrTiO3 perovskite oxide, prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), was used to improve the growth of this oxide significantly. This method overcomes the ultimatum of stabilizing perovskite oxide growth using MBE since the valence mismatch between the substrate and the films were effectively masked by the ultra-thin SrTiO3 and further supported interfacial charge transfer. Interestingly, we also discovered that the perovskite oxides SrNbO3 and SrTiO3 replace K in KTaO3 substrates by Sr, regardless of the deposition technique used, which is generally considered a reason for many interfacial effects. The growth of SrNbO3 was unaffected by the K deficiency when the stable buffer layer was introduced.</description>

Abstract: Stacking nonpolar, monolayer materials has emerged as an effective strategy to harvest ferroelectricity in two-dimensional (2D) van de Waals (vdW) materials. At a particular stacking sequence, interlayer charge transfer allows for the generation of out-of-plane dipole components, and the polarization magnitude and direction can be altered by an interlayer sliding. In this work, we use {\it ab initio} calculations and demonstrate that in prototype sliding ferroelectrics 3R-stacked bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides MoS$_2$, the out-of-plane electric polarization can be robustly tuned by photoexcitation in a large range for a given sliding. Such tuning is associated with both a structural origin -- i.e., photoinduced structural distortion, and a charge origin -- namely, the distribution of photoexcited carriers. We elucidate different roles that photoexcitation plays in modulating sliding ferroelectricity under different light intensities, and we highlight the pivotal role of light in manipulating polarization of 2D vdW materials.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Optical Properties of Tin Oxide Aerogels through Defect Passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tin oxide aerogels were synthesized using an epoxide-assisted technique and characterized with Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, and UV-Vis to study the effects of post-synthesis annealing and peroxide treatment. While bulk tin oxide exhibits an optical bandgap of $3.6$ eV, its aerogel form often displays a larger apparent bandgap around $4.6$ eV due to defects. Our study reveals that annealing induces a partial phase change from SnO$_2$ to SnO, but is ineffective in removing defects. Conversely, peroxide passivation effectively lowers the bandgap and disorder levels, suggesting that dangling bonds are the primary cause of the increased bandgap in tin oxide aerogels. These findings offer insights for optimizing the optical properties of tin oxide aerogels for applications like solar cells.</description>

      <title>High-temperature Superconducting Oxide without Copper at Ambient Pressure</title>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O system (the cuprate) at the 30 K range in 1986 marked a significant breakthrough, as it far exceeded the highest known critical temperature ($T_c$) at the time and surpassed the predicted 30 K limit, which was thought to be the maximum before phonon-mediated electron pairing would break down due to thermal excitation. Despite recent successful observations of superconductivity in nickel-oxide-based compounds (the nickelate), superconductivity above 30 K at ambient pressure in a system that is isostructural and isoelectronic to the cuprate but without copper has remained elusive. Here, we report a superconducting $T_c$ above 35 K under ambient pressure in hole-doped, late rare-earth infinite-layer nickel oxide (Sm-Eu-Ca-Sr)NiO$_2$ thin films. Electron microscopy reveals a small thickness of ~2 nm of infinite-layer phase stabilised at present, which indicates a higher temperature superconductivity should be observable in clean bulk crystals.</description>

      <title>Element-specific, non-destructive profiling of layered heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures is now so precise that metrology has become a key challenge for progress in science and applications. It is now relatively straightforward to characterize classic III-V and group IV heterostructures consisting of slabs of different semiconductor alloys with thicknesses of $\sim$5~nm and greater using sophisticated tools such as \mbox{X-ray} diffraction, high energy X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. However, profiling thin layers with nm or sub-nm thickness, \textit{e.g.} atomically thin dopant layers (\mbox{$\delta$-layers}), of impurities required for modulation doping and spin-based quantum and classical information technologies is more challenging.
  Here, we present theory and experiment showing how resonant-contrast \mbox{X-ray} reflectometry meets this challenge. The technique takes advantage of the change in the scattering factor of atoms as their core level resonances are scanned by varying the \mbox{X-ray} energy. We demonstrate the capability of the resulting element-selective, non-destructive profilometry for single arsenic $\delta$-layers within silicon, and show that the sub-nm electronic thickness of the \mbox{$\delta$-layers} corresponds to sub-nm chemical thickness. In combination with X-ray fluorescence imaging, this enables non-destructive three-dimensional characterization of nano-structured quantum devices. Due to the strong resonances at soft X-ray wavelengths, the technique is also ideally suited to characterize layered quantum materials, such as cuprates or the topical infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Direct writing of high temperature superconducting Josephson junctions using a thermal scanning probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate for the first time the creation of Josephson-like superconducting nanojunctions using a thermal scanning probe to directly inscribe weak links into microstrips of YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO). Our method effectively reduces the critical current (Ic) over an order of magnitude. The resulting nanobridges exhibit clear evidence of Josephson effects, of SNS-type junctions, as shown by both the DC and AC Josephson effects. This approach provides a novel and flexible method for scaling up quantum mechanical circuits that operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Additionally, it offers a promising pathway for modifying properties of the junctions in-situ and post fabrication.</description>

      <title>Orbital selective Mott transition and magnetic moment in charge density wave heterostructures NbSe$_2/$Ta$X_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of charge density wave (CDW) heterostructures out of monolayers of 1T-NbSe$_2$ and 1T-Ta$X_2$ (where, $X=$ S and Se) using first-principles followed by dynamical calculations. The CDW-ordered crystal structures are simulated using $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ supercells of NbSe$_2$ and Ta$X_2$. These two-dimensional heterostructures are modeled by stacking monolayers of NbSe$_2$ and Ta$X_2$ along (001) direction. Our investigations reveal the presence of non-zero magnetic moments in NbSe$_2/$TaS$_2$, albeit without a long-range magnetic order, raising the issue of a possible quantum spin liquid (QSL) as suggested for monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$ recently. In contrast, the NbSe$_2/$TaSe$_2$ heterostructure exhibits no magnetic moment. In order to capture the dynamical effects of local correlation, we use DFT plus multi-orbital dynamical mean field theory (MO-DMFT). Our findings indicate that NbSe$_2/$TaS$_2$ is considerably influenced by the dynamic corrections, whereas NbSe$_2/$TaSe$_2$ shows minimal effects. Additionally, an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT) is observed in the NbSe$_2/$TaS$_2$ bilayer heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Stochastic evolution elasto-plastic modeling of a metallic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a general data-driven approach to stochastic elastoplastic modelling that leverages atomistic simulation data directly rather than by fitting parameters. The approach is developed in the context of metallic glasses, which present inherent complexities due to their disordered structure. By harvesting statistics from simulated metallic glass shear response histories, the material state is mapped onto a two-dimensional state space consisting of the shear stress and the inelastic contribution to the potential energy. The resulting elastoplastic model is intrinsically stochastic and represented as a non-deterministic dynamical map. The state space statistics provide insights into the deformation physics of metallic glasses, revealing that two state variables are sufficient to describe the main features of the elastoplastic response. In this two-dimensional state space, the gradually quenched metallic glass rejuvenates during the initial quasi-elastic shearing, ultimately reaching a steady state that fluctuates about a fixed point in the state space as rejuvenation and aging balance.</description>

      <title>High Mobility SiGe/Ge 2DHG Heterostructure Quantum Wells for Semiconductor Hole Spin Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong spin-orbit coupling and relatively weak hyperfine interactions make germanium hole spin qubits a promising candidate for semiconductor quantum processors. The two-dimensional hole gas structure of strained Ge quantum wells serves as the primary material platform for spin hole qubits.A low disorder material environment is essential for this process. In this work, we fabricated a Ge/SiGe heterojunction with a 60 nm buried quantum well layer on a Si substrate using reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition technology. At a temperature of 16 mK, when the carrier density is 1.87*10^11/cm2, we obtained a mobility as high as 308.64*10^4cm2/Vs. Concurrently, double quantum dot and planar germanium coupling with microwave cavities were also successfully achieved.This fully demonstrates that this structure can be used for the preparation of higher-performance hole spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent magnetic property in a superconducting quintuple-layer nickelate La6Ni5O12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the detailed magnetic properties of a recently discovered superconducting nickelate Nd6Ni5O12, we performed the first-principles electronic structure calculation based on density functional theory. The band dispersion, electronic charge distribution and the magnetic moment are computed with La substituted for Nd, and compared with another structural type of nickel-based superconducting material, namely, RNiO2 (R: rare-earth elements). In particular, we estimated the magnetic exchange interaction strength based on magnetic force theory. Our results show that the inter-atomic magnetic couplings are notably reduced by intrinsic hole doping from the blocking fluorite slab which validates the conventional view of regarding Nd6Ni5O12 as a doped case of its infinite-layer counterpart. At the same time, however, the interactions are markedly layer-dependent. The outer most NiO2 layer adjacent to the blocking fluorite roughly corresponds to the 20% chemical doping in the infinite-layer material whereas the inner layers have stronger couplings. The long-range nature and the out-of-plane interactions are also presented. Our results provide useful information to understand this new superconducting nickelate whose intrinsic layer structure is obviously distinctive.</description>

      <title>Chemical interaction and molecular growth of a highly dipolar merocyanine molecule on metal surfaces: A photoelectron spectroscopy study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth and ordering of molecules on surfaces is an intriguing research topic as insights gained here can be of significant relevance for organic electronic devices. While often simple, rigid molecules are employed as model systems, we show results for a highly dipolar merocyanine which is studied on top of Au(100), Ag(100) and Cu(100) metal single crystals. Film thicknesses ranging from submonolayer to multilayer regimes are analyzed using UV (UPS) and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For the monolayer regime, there is strong indication of face on orientation, with both of the molecules sulfur atoms bonding to the metal surfaces. Here, on Ag and Au(100) the sulfur atoms lose some or all of their intrinsic charges due to a charge transfer with the substrate, while on Cu(100) a strong metal sulfur bond forms. The interaction between the substrate and the molecules can also be seen in the intensity and width of the highest occupied molecular orbital features in UPS. Upon multilayer deposition, a gradual lowering in ionization energy is observed, likely due to the formation of antiparallel dimers followed by an increased charge carrier delocalization due to the formation of an extended molecular aggregate for thicker layers. Interestingly, on Cu(100) the aggregated phase is already observed for much lower deposition, showing the importance of substrate-molecule interaction on the subsequent film growth. Therefore, this study offers a detailed understanding of the interface formation and electronic structure evolution for merocyanine films on different metal surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new phase of collinear spin-order sharing similarities with antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, has introduced a new guiding principle for spintronic/thermoelectric applications due to its direction-dependent magnetic properties. Fulfilling the promise to exploit altermagnetism for device design depends on identifying materials with tuneable transport properties. The search for intrinsic altermagnets has so far focused on the role of anisotropy in the crystallographic symmetries and in the bandstructure. Here, we present a different mechanism that approaches this goal by leveraging the interplay between a Hubbard local repulsion and the itinerant magnetism given by the presence of van Hove singularities. We show that altermagnetism is stable for a broad range of interactions and dopings and we focus on tunability of the spin-charge conversion ratio.</description>

      <title>An energy-dependent broadening of Rashba-like spin splitting in Au2Sb surface alloy with periodic structural defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06183v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we report a novel AuSb 2D superstructure on Au(111) that shows agreements and discrepancies to the expected electronic features of the ideal 2D surface alloys with $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find a spin splitting of the alloy bands with antiparallel spin polarization, stemming from Rashba spin-orbit coupling. However, the observed Rashba bands are significantly broadened. Taking advantage of the good agreement between the experimental results and DFT calculations, we determine that the broadening of the Rashba band is due to the perturbations from the 3-pointed-star-shaped defects acting as nonresonant impurities in the Au2Sb superstructure. These periodic defects can shift the energy position of the Rashba band without breaking the in-plane rotational symmetry and mirror symmetry, which suggests that introducing periodic defects into a Rashba SOC system possesses a great potential in engineering the spin-dependent properties of spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reports experimental evidence of random magnetic behavior observed in modified barium hexagonal ferrites. We observe a significant transition in the magnetic properties of this system when divalent cations (Ni2+, Cu2+, Mn2+) are incorporated into the structure and give rise to a magnetic nanocomposite. Such introduction randomly occurs throughout each sample and creates conditions for such materials to behave as random anisotropy magnets. We verify the occurrence of such behavior in our samples by fitting the magnetization in approaching saturation to the corresponding theoretical model. We therefore analyze the microwave absorption capacities of random anisotropy magnets in the GHz range and predict large and broad absorption signals under certain conditions. The findings presented here postulate, for the first time, ceramic materials as promising random anisotropy magnets and underline their potential as microwave absorbers, in good agreement with recent theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic properties and microwave absorption capabilities are studied in an anechoic chamber under real radar conditions for mono and bilayer composite samples consisting of a polymeric matrix and a magnetic powder filler, either metallic or ceramic. The effect of the filler type and the filling factor is investigated. The results demonstrate exceptional broadband microwave absorption, making these materials highly suitable for stealth technology applications. The experimentally measured absorptions reach -40 dB, while model-based predictions suggest that these systems could overpass the barrier of -50 dB. The experimental results are supported by models, both for single and bilayer systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lead-free materials based on the $\text{(Ba,Ca)(Zr,Ti)O}_{3}$ (BCZT) system exhibit excellent electromechanical properties that can be strongly modified by small amounts of dopants. Here, we use a high throughput strategy to unravel the influence of aliovalent doping with Ce on dielectric and piezoelectric properties of BCTZ. We synthesize and characterize a single BCTZ thin film with a composition gradient from undoped to 0.2 mol % cerium doping. The cerium doping increases the piezoelectric coefficient from $42.3\pm 2.9 \text{pm V}^{-1}$ (undoped) to $63\pm 2.4 \text{pm V}^{-1}$ for 0.06 Ce-mol\%, and then decreases to $38.4 \pm 1.3 \text{pm V}^{-1}$ for the maximum amount of cerium (0.2 mol %). An investigation of sub-coercive field non-linearities reveal that these variations are not only induced by changes in dynamics and densities of domain walls. The results highlight the advantage of high throughput techniques to identify ideal compositions for applications, without synthesizing a high number of samples with unavoidable sample-to-sample variations.</description>

      <title>Radar shielding experiments by composite bilayer magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strong increase of the reflection loss (from 25 up to 35 dBs) and an extension of the absorption bandwidth up to 20% under far-field real radar conditions are experimentally reported in this work by creating a functional bilayer system. Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a dielectric matrix filled with magnetic entities (powder or wires). Combining the two types of materials into a bilayer structure has shown unprecedented improvements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former absorption of each layer. The potential of random magnets to create thin broadband absorbers is also demonstrated. The capacity to improve the shielding behavior is strongly related to each layer's permittivity, permeability, and thickness. This provides strong control over the design of novel materials for stealth applications.</description>

      <title>Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling process is presented and validated against finite element simulations. The model generalises the classical slab method of modelling cold rolling, and for the first time, is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long thin roll gaps. The model is based on the asymptotic method of multiple scales, with the systematic assumptions of a long thin roll gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on a long length scale corresponding to the roll-gap length and matches with slab methods. The next-order correction varies on both this long length scale and a short length scale associated with the workpiece thickness, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through the thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, this model compares well with finite element simulations that employ more realistic material behaviour (including elasticity and strain hardening). These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The split-charge equilibration method is extended to describe dissipative charge transfer similarly as the Drude model, whereby the generic frequency-dependent dielectric permitivitties or conductivities of dielectrics and metals can be mimicked. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a resistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for resistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging process and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages acting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction caused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable media.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of vortex gyrotropic mode excited by surface acoustic waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional method for exciting spin-wave dynamics in magnetic materials involves microwave magnetic fields generated by current injection into inductive antennas. However, there is a growing interest in non-inductive excitation methods. Magneto-acoustic effects present a viable alternative, where strains produced by applying voltages to a piezoelectric substrate can couple to spin-waves in a magnetic film. Recently, it has been proposed that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can excite the gyrotropic mode of the vortex state in a magnetic disk. Here we report on experiments utilizing a magnetic resonance force microscope to investigate magnetization dynamics in CoFeB sub-micrometer disks in the vortex state, grown on a Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ substrate. The device design enables excitation of the gyrotropic mode either inductively, using an antenna on top of the disks, or acoustically via SAWs launched from an interdigital transducer. Our modelling indicates that the lattice rotation {\omega}xz generates a localized magneto-acoustic field that displaces the vortex core from the disk center, initiating the gyration motion. Tuning of the magneto-acoustic torque acting on the vortex structure is achieved by a perpendicular magnetic field. These results demonstrate the clear excitation of the vortex gyrotropic mode by magneto-acoustic excitation.</description>

      <title>How does Goldene Stack?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent synthesis of Goldene, a 2D atomic monolayer of gold, has opened new avenues in exploring novel materials. However, the question of when multilayer Goldene transitions into bulk gold remains unresolved. This study used density functional theory calculations to address this fundamental question. Our findings reveal that multilayer Goldene retains an AA-like stacking configuration of up to six layers, with no observation of Bernal-like stacking as seen in graphene. Goldene spontaneously transitions to a bulk-like gold structure at seven layers, adopting a rhombohedral (ABC-like) stacking characteristic of bulk face-centered cubic (FCC) gold. The atomic arrangement converges entirely to the bulk gold lattice for more than ten layers. Quantum confinement significantly impacts the electronic properties, with monolayer and bulk Goldene exhibiting a single Dirac cone at the X-point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast, multilayer Goldene shows two Dirac cones at the X- and Y-points. Additionally, monolayer Goldene exhibits anisotropic optical absorption, which is absent in bulk gold. This study provides a deeper understanding of multilayer Goldene's structural and electronic properties and stacked 2D materials in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: Type-I: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, Type-II: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and Type-III: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective effect of spin reorientation on the Dirac fermions in a non-charge-ordered kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Ge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome magnets provide a fascinating platform for the realization of correlated topological quantum phases under various magnetic ground states. However, the effect of the magnetic spin configurations on the characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice layer remains elusive. Here, utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we report the spectroscopic evidence for the spin-reorientation effect of a kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Ge, which is composed solely of kagome planes. As the Fe moments cant from the $c$ axis into the $ab$ plane upon cooling, the two kinds of kagome-derived Dirac fermions respond quite differently. The one with less-dispersive bands ($k_z$ $\sim$ 0) containing the $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals evolves from gapped into nearly gapless, while the other with linear dispersions ($k_z$ $\sim$ $\pi$) embracing the $3d_{xz}$/$3d_{yz}$ components remains intact, suggesting that the effect of spin reorientation on the Dirac fermions has an orbital selectivity. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is no signature of charge order formation in Fe$_3$Ge, contrasting with its sibling compound FeGe, a newly established charge-density-wave kagome magnet.</description>

      <title>Central role of filler-polymer interplay in nonlinear reinforcement of elastomeric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticles can greatly enhance the mechanical response of elastomeric polymers essential to a wide range of applications, yet their precise molecular mechanisms of high-strain reinforcement remain largely unresolved. Here we show, based on molecular dynamics simulations, that high-strain reinforcement emerges from an interplay between granular nanoparticulate compressive behavior in the normal direction and polymer incompressibility. This feedback loop, which is initiated by a mismatch in the Poisson ratios of nanofiller and polymer, invokes a contribution from the polymer's bulk modulus to the elongational stress, while the tendency of the polymer to contract in the normal direction maintains a near-jammed filler state. This effect persists even once the direct filler elongational contribution becomes dissipative after the 'Payne effect' yield. These results indicate that direct particle-particle contact effects, even in the absence of potential augmenting mechanisms such as glassy polymer bridges, can drive the mechanical reinforcement effects typical of experimental systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall Conductivity in a Graphene/Haldane and Haldane/Haldane Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital Hall conductivity in bilayer graphene (G/G) by modifying one or both the layers as Haldane type ($\rm G/ \tilde G$ : Graphene/Haldane and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ : Haldane/Haldane) with the inclusion of next nearest neighbour (NNN) hopping strength ($t_2$) and flux ($\phi$). It is observed that the low energy bands of $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ are isolated with a gap at charge neutrality with the next nearest neighbour (NNN) hopping term $t_2e^{\pm i\phi}$. The time reversal (\textit{TR}) symmetry breaking with $t_2e^{\pm i\phi}$ induces a large orbital magnetic moment ($\vb{m}_n(\vb{k})$) for the $n^{th}$ band in $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ bilayers. This \textit{TR} symmetry breaking, modulated by the $t_2$ strength, leads to the emergence of {\it Orbital Ferromagnetism} and {\it Valley Orbital Magnetism} within the BZ for the Haldane single layer as well for both $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$. We show that for the applied longitudinal electric fields, the intrinsic angular momentum ($L^z$) gives the orbital current ($\mathcal{J}^{z,orb}$) along a transverse direction and generates the orbital Hall conductivity (OHC). We further show that the orbital magnetic polarity leads the Haldane single layer to {\it Orbital Chern Insulator} with the quantized OHC in the gap over the occupied bands. Moreover, the accumulation of orbital magnetic moment of the bands in Haldane graphene bilayer shows {\it Quantum Orbital Hall Insulator} and {\it Orbital Chern Insulators}. Similarly, we show that in the hetero-bilayers, one of the layers of the Haldane type generates the orbital magnetism and induces the OHC. We conclude that the isolated bands in Haldane graphene bilayers with external stimuli are of an orbital nature and have various quantum orbital Hall phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable another class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable alternative approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of the electronic wavefunctions. These properties are encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. While Berry curvature-mediated transport effects such as the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and provide new strategies to design functionalities based on the quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Spin Squeezing and Quantum Sensing in a Spin-5/2 Heisenberg Molecular Iron(III) Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately $30\,\text{K}$ and $70\,\text{K}$, respectively. We also utilized a spin squeezing parameter to identify parameter regions of coherent, entangled, and squeezed states of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our findings demonstrate that the squeezed states, which are relevant for technological applications, can be achieved at temperatures below $15\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields under $25\,\text{T}$. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.</description>
