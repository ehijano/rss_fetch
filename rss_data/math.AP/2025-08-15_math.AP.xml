      <title>An inverse problem on a metric graph with cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a quantum graph consisting of a ring with two attached edges, and assume Kirchhoff-Neumann conditions hold at the internal vertices. Associated to this graph is a Schr\"{o}dinger type operator $L=-\Delta +q(x)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions at the two boundary nodes. Let $\{ \omega_n^2, \ \varphi_n(x)\}$ be the eigenvalues and associated normalized eigenfunctions. Let $v_1$ be a boundary vertex, and $v_2$ the adjacent internal vertex. Assume we know the following data: $\{ \omega_n^2,\partial_x \varphi_n(v_1),\partial_x\varphi_n(v_2)\}.$ Here $\partial_x\varphi_n(v_2)$ refers to an outward normal derivative at $v_2$ along one of the edges incident to the other internal vertex. From this data we determine the following unknown quantities: the lengths of edges and the potential functions on each edge.</description>

      <title>Non-Decaying Solutions to the 2D Dissipative Quasi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the surface quasi-geostrophic equation in two spatial dimensions, with subcritical diffusion (i.e. with fractional diffusion of order $2\alpha$ for $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2}$.) We establish existence of solutions without assuming either decay at spatial infinity or spatial periodicity. One obstacle is that for $L^{\infty}$ data, the constitutive law may not be applicable, as Riesz transforms are unbounded. However, for $L^{\infty}$ initial data for which the constitutive law does converge, we demonstrate that there exists a unique solution locally in time, and that the constitutive law continues to hold at positive times. In the case that $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1]$ and that the initial data has some smoothness (specifically, if the data is in $C^{2}$), we demonstrate a maximum principle and show that this unique solution is actually classical and global in time. Then, a density argument allows us to show that mild solutions with only $L^{\infty}$ data are also global in time, and also possess this maximum principle. Finally, we introduce a related problem in which we replace the usual constitutive law for the surface quasi-geostrophic equation with a generalization of Sertfati type, and prove the same results for this relaxed model.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Riemann Problem for a $2 \times 2$ System of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance Laws With a Time-Dependent Source Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of one conservation law and one balance law with a time-dependent source term, and provide a comprehensive analysis of Riemann solutions, including the non-classical overcompressive delta shocks. The minimal yet representative structure of the system captures essential features of transport under density constraints and, despite its simplicity, serves as a versatile prototype for crowd-limited transport processes across diverse contexts, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. In addition to non-self-similar solutions mentioned above, the associated Riemann problem admits solution structures that traverse vacuum states ($\rho = 0$) and the critical density threshold ($\rho = \bar{\rho}$), where mobility vanishes and characteristic speed degenerates. Moreover, the explicit time dependence in the source term leads to the breakdown of self-similarity, resulting in distinct Riemann solutions over successive time intervals and highlighting the dynamic nature of the solution landscape. The theoretical findings are numerically confirmed using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>

Abstract: We consider a linear perturbation of the classical geometric problem of prescribing the scalar and the boundary mean curvature problem in a Riemannian manifold with umbilic boundary provided the Weyl tensor is non-zero everywhere. We will deal with the case of negative scalar curvature showing the existence of a positive solutions when $n\geq 8$.</description>

      <title>Regularity estimates on harmonic eigenmaps with arbitrary number of coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the well-established regularity estimates on harmonic maps on surfaces to question their independence with respect to the dimension of the target manifold. We are mainly interested in harmonic maps into target ellipsoids, that we call Laplace harmonic eigenmaps. These maps are related to critical metrics in the context of eigenvalue optimization. The tools that we gather here are useful to handle convergence of almost critical metrics via Palais-Smale sequences of (almost harmonic) eigenmaps. They could also be a preliminary step for a general regularity theory for critical points of infinite combinations of eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate into the regularity of $\mathrm{BV}^{\mathbb{A}}$-minimisers for $\mathbb{C}$-elliptic differential operators $\mathbb{A}$ in $2$ dimensions. Our studies strongly rely on the special structure of such differential operators. The gradient integrability is established for the sharp ellipticity range known from the (symmetric) gradient case.</description>

      <title>From Kac particles to the Landau equation with hard potentials: BBGKY hierarchy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kac particle model for the space-homogenous Landau equation with hard potentials. By showing a sharper Povzner-type inequality, we obtain the uniform-in-time and uniform-in-N propagation of exponential moment for the first marginal of the solution of the many-particle Liouville equation. This key property enables us to show the uniqueness of weak solutions of the corresponding infinite Landau hierarchy by coupling method. As a result, we prove the propagation of chaos for the Landau equation with hard potentials.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and relaxation in a simplified model for viscoelastic phase separation via Hilbertian gradients flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with a gradient-flow approach to a Cahn-Hilliard model for viscoelastic phase separation introduced by Zhou et al. (Phys. Rev. E, 2006) in its variant with constant mobility. By means of time-incremental minimisation and generalised contractivity estimates, we establish the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for moderately regular initial data. For general finite-energy data we obtain the existence of gradient-flow solutions and a stability estimate of weak-strong type. We further study the asymptotic behaviour for relaxation time and bulk modulus depending on a small parameter. Depending on the scaling, we recover the Cahn-Hilliard, the mass-conserving Allen-Cahn or the viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation. A challenge in the well-posedness analysis is the failure of semiconvexity of the appropriate driving functional, which is caused by a phase-dependence of the bulk modulus.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{C}^2$ estimates for general $p$-Hessian equations on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\mathrm{C}^2$ estimates for $p$-Hessian equations with general left-hand and right-hand terms on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$. To overcome the constraints of closed manifolds, we advance a new kind of "subsolution", called pseudo-solution, which generalizes "$\mathcal{C}$-subsolution" to some extent and is well-defined for fully general $p$-Hessian equations. Based on pseudo-solutions, we prove the $\mathrm{C}^0$ estimates, first-order estimates for general $p$-Hessian equations, and the corresponding second-order estimates when $p\in\{2, n-1, n\}$, under sharp conditions -- we don't impose curvature restrictions, convexity conditions or "MTW condition" on our main results. Some other conclusions related to a priori estimates and different kinds of "subsolutions" are also given, including estimates for "semi-convex" solutions and when there exists a pseudo-solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an upper bound on the heat kernel of the Keller-Segel finite particle system that exhibits blow up effects. The proof exploits a connection between Keller-Segel finite particles and certain non-local operators. The latter allows to address some aspects of the critical behaviour of the Keller-Segel system resulting from its two-dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and Normal Mean Ricci Curvatures: A Bochner--Weitzenboeck Identity for Simple d-Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two pointwise subspace averages of sectional curvature on a d-dimensional plane Pi in T_p M: (i) the intrinsic mean Ricci (the average of sectional curvatures of 2-planes contained in Pi); and (ii) the normal (mixed) mean Ricci (the average of sectional curvatures of 2-planes spanned by one vector in Pi and one in Pi^perp). Using Jacobi-field expansions, these means occur as the r^2/6 coefficients in the intrinsic (d-1)-sphere and normal (n-d-1)-sphere volume elements. A direct consequence is a Bochner--Weitzenboeck identity for simple d-vectors V (built from an orthonormal frame X_1,...,X_d with Pi = span{X_i}): the curvature term equals d(n-d) times the normal mean Ricci of Pi. This yields two immediate applications: (a) a Bochner vanishing criterion for harmonic simple d-vectors under a positive lower bound on the normal mean Ricci; and (b) a Lichnerowicz-type lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Hodge Laplacian on simple d-eigenfields.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give results on optimal constants of isoperimetric inequalities involving Steklov eigenvalues on surfaces with boundary. We both consider this question on Riemannian surfaces with a same given topology or more specifically belonging to the same conformal class. We provide new examples of topological disks that realize optimal constants. We prove inequalities that relate conformal invariants associated to combinations of Steklov eigenvalues on a compact Riemannian surface with boundary and the ones on the disk. In the appendix, we show rigidity of the first conformal Steklov eigenvalue on annuli and M\"obius bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we prove global well-posedness for the massive Maxwell-Dirac system in the Lorenz gauge in $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, for small, sufficiently smooth and decaying initial data, as well as modified scattering for the solutions. Heuristically we exploit the close connection between the massive Maxwell-Dirac and the wave-Klein-Gordon equations, while developing a novel approach which applies directly at the level of the Dirac equations. The modified scattering result follows from a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions inside the light cone, which we derive via the method of testing with wave packets of Ifrim-Tataru.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation. While the existence theory has been intensely studied, properties like dispersive estimates for the solutions have not yet been investigated. Here we address this question for the problem with small and localized data, and show that a dispersive estimate for the solution holds globally in time. For the proof of our result we use vector field methods combined with the \emph{testing by wave packets method}, whose implementation in this problem is novel.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Steklov problem on surfaces</title>

Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to $6\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to the third threshold, i.e., for parameters $\beta^2 &lt; 6\pi$. The key novelty in our approach is the introduction of the so-called resonant equation, whose solution is entirely deterministic and completely captures the size of the solution to the dynamical sine-Gordon model. The probabilistic fluctuations in the dynamical sine-Gordon model are then controlled using uniform estimates for modified stochastic objects.</description>

      <title>Analysis of non-overlapping models with a weighted infinite delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of this article is cell motility modeling. Approximating cells as rigid spheres we take into account for both non-penetration and adhesions forces. Adhesions are modeled as a memory-like microscopic elastic forces. This leads to a delayed and constrained vector valued system of equations. We prove that the solution of these equations converges when {\epsilon}, the linkages turnover parameter, tends to zero to the a constrained model with friction. We discretize the problem and penalize the constraints to get an uncon?strained minimization problem. The well-posedness of the constrained problem is obtained by letting the penalty parameter to tend to zero. Energy estimates `a la De Giorgi are derived accounting for delay. Thanks to these estimates and the convexity of the constraints, we obtain compactness uniformly with respect to the discretisation step and {\epsilon}, this is the mathematically involved part of the article. Considering that the characteristic bonds lifetime goes to zero, we recover a friction model comparable to [Venel et al, ESAIM, 2011] but under more realistic assumptions on the external load, this part being also one of the challenging aspects of the work</description>

      <title>Bound states of nonlinear Dirac equation on noncompact quantum graphs with localized nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE) on noncompact quantum graphs featuring localized nonlinearities, specifically under Kirchhoff-type vertex conditions. Our primary focus is on the existence and multiplicity of bound states, which emerge as critical points of the NLDE Lagrangian functional. The associated action functional is strongly indefinite, and notably, the Palais-Smale condition fails to hold. To address these challenges, we employ recently developed critical point theorems to derive our results.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity results for non-local operators of elliptic type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of problems proposed by Servadei and Valdinoci in \cite{Ser3}; namely, \begin{equation}\label{prob_0} \left\{\begin{aligned} -\mathcal{L}_{K} u(x)-\lambda u(x) &amp; =f(x,u), \mbox{ for } x\in \Omega; u &amp; =0 \quad \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{N}\backslash\Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation} where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is an open bounded set with Lipschitz boundary, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, $f\in C^{1}(\overline{\Omega}\times\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$, with $f(x,0) = 0$ for $x\in\Omega$, and $\mathcal{L}_K$ is a non-local integrodifferential operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. By computing the critical groups of the associated energy functional for problem (1) at the origin and at infinity, respectively, we prove that problem (\ref{prob_0}) has three nontrivial solutions for the case $\lambda &lt; \lambda_1$ and two nontrivial solutions for the case $\lambda\geqslant\lambda_1,$ where $\lambda_1$ is the first eigenvalue of the operator $-\mathcal{L}_K$. Finally, assuming that the nonlinearity $f$ is odd in the second variable, we prove the existence of an unbounded sequence of weak solutions of problem (1) for the case $\lambda\geqslant\lambda_1$. We use variational methods and infinite-dimensional Morse theory to obtain the results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of composite waves of shock profile and rarefaction for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of composite waves consisting of a shock profile and a rarefaction wave for the one-dimensional isothermal Navier--Stokes--Poisson (NSP) system, which describes the ion dynamics in a collision-dominated plasma. More precisely, we prove that if the initial data are sufficiently close in the $H^2$ norm to the Riemann data corresponding to a solution consisting of a shock and a rarefaction wave of the associated quasi-neutral Euler system, then the solution to the Cauchy problem for the NSP system converges, up to a dynamical shift, to a superposition of the corresponding shock profile and the rarefaction wave as time tends to infinity. Our proof is based on the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, which has recently been applied to the Navier--Stokes equations to establish the asymptotic stability of composite waves. To adapt this method to the NSP system, we employ a modulated relative functional introduced in our previous work on the stability of single shock profiles.</description>

      <title>Improved fractal Weyl bounds for convex cocompact hyperbolic surfaces and large resonance-free regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a convex cocompact hyperbolic surface, and let $\delta$ denote the Hausdorff dimension of its limit set. Let $N_X(\sigma,T)$ denote the number of resonances of $X$ inside the box $[\sigma, \delta] + i[0,T]$. We prove that for all $\sigma &gt; \delta/2$, we have \[ N_X(\sigma,T) \ll_\epsilon T^{1 + \delta - 2(2\sigma - \delta) + \epsilon}. \] This strengthens the previously established "improved" fractal Weyl bounds due to Naud \cite{Naud14} and Dyatlov \cite{Dya19}. Moreover, this result implies that for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exist resonance-free rectangular boxes of arbitrary height within the strip \[ \left\{\, s \in \mathbb{C} : \tfrac{3}{4}\delta + \epsilon &lt; \mathrm{Re}(s) &lt; \delta\, \right\}. \] Our proof combines Naud's approach \cite{Naud14} with the refined transfer operator machinery developed by Dyatlov-Zworski \cite{DyZw18}, as well as a new estimate for oscillatory integrals that arise naturally in our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic Yang-Mills heat equation on the two-dimensional torus. Using regularity structures, Chandra, Chevyrev, Hairer, and Shen previously proved both the local well-posedness and gauge-covariance of this model. In this article, we revisit their results using para-controlled calculus. One of the main ingredients is a new coordinate-invariant perspective on vector-valued stochastic objects.</description>

      <title>Magic angle (in)stability and mobility edges in disordered Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why do experiments only observe one magic angle in twisted bilayer graphene, despite standard models like the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian predicting an infinite number? In this article, we explore the relative stability of larger magic angles compared to smaller ones. Specifically, we analyze how disorder impacts these angles as described by the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian in the chiral limit. Changing focus, we investigate the topological and transport properties of a specific magic angle under disorder. We identify a mobility edge near the flat band energy for small disorder, showing that this mobility edge persists even when all Chern numbers are zero. This persistence is attributed to the system's $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, which enables non-trivial sublattice transport. Notably, this effect remains robust beyond the chiral limit and near perfect magic angles, aligning with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Entropic Selection Principle for Monge's Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the small regularization limit of entropic optimal transport when the cost function is the Euclidean distance in dimensions $d &gt; 1$, and the marginal measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Our results establish that the limiting optimal transport plan is supported on transport rays. Furthermore, within each transport ray, the limiting transport plan uniquely minimizes a relative entropy functional with respect to specific reference measures supported on the rays. This provides a complete and unique characterization of the limiting transport plan. While similar results have been obtained for $d = 1$ in \cite{Marino} and for discrete measures in \cite{peyr\'e2020computationaloptimaltransport}, this work resolves the previously open case in higher dimensions $d&gt;1.$</description>

      <title>Averaged Controllability of the Random Schr\"odinger Equation with Diffusivity Following Absolutely Continuous Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the averaged controllability of the random Schr\"odinger equation, with diffusivity as a random variable drawn from a general probability distribution. First, we show that the solutions to these random Schr\"odinger equations are null averaged controllable with an open-loop control independent of randomness from any arbitrary subset of the domain with strictly positive measure and in any time. This is done for an interesting class of random variables, including certain stable distributions, specifically recovering the known result when the random diffusivity follows a normal or Cauchy distribution. Second, by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, we prove for any time the lack of averaged exact controllability in a $L^2$ setting for all absolutely continuous random variables. Notably, this implies that this property is not inherited from the exact controllability of the Schr\"odinger equation. Third, we show that simultaneous null controllability is not possible except for a finite number of scenarios. Finally, we perform numerical simulations that robustly validate the theoretical results.</description>
