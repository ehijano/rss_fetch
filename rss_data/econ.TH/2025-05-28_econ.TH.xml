      <title>Trade Networks and the Rise of a Global Currency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model of strategic competition between global currencies. Issuers choose their commitment levels for currency internationalization, while users -- interconnected in a trade network -- choose their usage of each currency for trade settlement. Our theoretical findings highlight not only the advantage of the status-quo issuer in maintaining dominance, but also the conditions under which an emerging issuer can attract users, potentially leading to a multi-currency payment system. The network centrality of users plays a key role in shaping both their currency choices and the strategic commitment levels of issuers. Our framework offers testable implications for the share of global currencies for trade settlement by linking the network structure, the strategy of issuers and the currency choice of users.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pricing Strategies for Heterogeneous Customers in Dual-Channel Closed-Loop Supply Chains: A Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-channel closed-loop supply chains (DCCLSCs) play a vital role in attaining both sustainability and profitability. This paper introduces a game-theoretic model to analyze optimal pricing strategies for primary and replacement customers within three distinct recycling frameworks: manufacturer-led, retailer-led, and collaborative recycling. The model identifies equilibrium pricing and subsidy decisions for each scenario, considering the primary customer's preference for the direct channel and the specific roles in recycling. The findings indicate that manufacturers tend to set lower prices in direct channels compared to retailers, aiming to stimulate demand and promote trade-ins. Manufacturer-led recycling initiatives result in stable pricing, whereas retailer-led recycling necessitates higher subsidies. Collaborative recycling strategies yield lower prices and an increase in trade-ins. Primary customers' preference for the direct channel significantly impacts pricing strategies, with a stronger preference leading to lower direct-channel prices and higher manufacturer subsidies. This paper contributes to the field by incorporating primary customer channel preferences and diverse recycling frameworks into DCCLSC pricing models. These insights assist manufacturers and retailers in adjusting pricing strategies and trade-in incentives according to primary customer preferences and associated costs, thereby enhancing profitability and recycling efficiency within DCCLSCs.</description>

      <title>Learned Collusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-learning can be described as an all-purpose automaton that provides estimates (Q-values) of the continuation values associated with each available action and follows the naive policy of almost always choosing the action with highest Q-value. We consider a family of automata based on Q-values, whose policy may systematically favor some actions over others, for example through a bias that favors cooperation. We look for stable equilibrium biases, easily learned under converging logit/best-response dynamics over biases, not requiring any tacit agreement. These biases strongly foster collusion or cooperation across a rich array of payoff and monitoring structures, independently of initial Q-values.</description>

      <title>Irrational Random Utility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Random Utility Model (RUM) is the leading model to represent the aggregate choices of a heterogeneous population of preference maximizers. We show that if (and only if) preferences are sufficiently uncorrelated, RUM choices can also be generated by a population of decision makers who do not maximize any preference. In proving this result, we also characterize the general class of choices generated by such irrational populations, with applications beyond the RUM framework. We discuss the relevance of our results for the falsifiability of the rational interpretation of RUMs, the inference of individual rationality from aggregate choices, and the nature of welfare judgments.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation in Economic Dynamics with a Non-Smooth Fiscal Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of economic growth models that includes the classical Ramsey--Cass--Koopmans capital accumulation model and verify that, under several assumptions, the value function of the model is the unique viscosity solution to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. Moreover, we discuss a solution method for these models using differential inclusion, where the subdifferential of the value function plays an important role. Next, we present an assumption under which the value function is a classical solution to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation, and show that many economic models satisfy this assumption. In particular, our result still holds in an economic growth model in which the government takes a non-smooth Keynesian policy rule.</description>

      <title>Hua-Chen New Theory of Economic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between 1957-1985, Chinese mathematician Loo-Keng Hua pioneered economic optimization theory through three key contributions: establishing economic stability's fundamental theorem, proving the uniqueness of equilibrium solutions in economic systems, and developing a consumption-integrated model 50 days before his death. Since 1988, Mu-Fa Chen has been working on Hua's theory. He introduced stochastics, namely Markov chains, to economic optimization theory. He updated and developed Hua's model and came up with a new model (Chen's model) which has become the starting point of a new economic optimization theory. Chen's theory can be applied to economic stability test, bankruptcy prediction, product ranking and classification, economic prediction and adjustment, economic structure optimization. Chen's theory can also provide efficient algorithms that are programmable and intelligent. {Stochastics} is the cornerstone of Chen's theory. There is no overlap between Chen's theory, and the existing mathematical economy theory and the economics developments that were awarded Nobel Prizes in Economics between 1969 and 2024. The distinguished features of Chen's theory from the existing theories are quantitative, calculable, predictable, optimizable, programmable and can be intelligent. This survey provides a theoretical overview of the newly published monograph \cite{5rw24}. Specifically, the invariant of the economic structure matrix, also known as the Chen's invariant, was first published in this survey.</description>

      <title>Trade among moral agents with information asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two agents trade an item in a simultaneous offer setting, where the exchange takes place if and only if the buyer's bid price weakly exceeds the seller's ask price. Each agent is randomly assigned the buyer or seller role. Both agents are characterized by a certain degree of Kantian morality, whereby they pick their bidding strategy behind a Veil of Ignorance, taking into account how the outcome would be affected if their trading partner adopted their strategy. I consider two variants with asymmetric information, respectively allowing buyers to have private information about their valuation or sellers to be privately informed about the item's quality. I show that when all trades are socially desirable, even the slightest degree of morality guarantees that the outcome is fully efficient. In turn, when quality is uncertain and some exchanges are socially undesirable, full efficiency is only achieved with sufficiently high moral standards. Moral concerns also ensure equal ex-ante treatment of the two agents in equilibrium. Finally, I show that if agents are altruistic rather than moral, inefficiencies persist even with a substantial degree of altruism.</description>
