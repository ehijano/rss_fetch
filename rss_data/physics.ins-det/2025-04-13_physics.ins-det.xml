      <title>Schottky detection techniques for ultra-rare short-lived ions in heavy ion storage rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-destructive Schottky detectors are indispensable devices widely used in experiments at heavy-ion storage rings. In particular, they can be used to accurately determine the masses and lifetimes of short-lived exotic nuclear species. Single-ion sensitivity -- which enables highest sensitivity -- has been regularly achieved in the past utilizing resonant cavity detectors. Recent designs and analysis methods aim at pushing the limits of measurement accuracy by increasing the dimensionality of the acquired data, namely the position of the particle as well as the phase difference between several detectors. This work describes current methods and future perspectives of Schottky detection techniques focusing at their application for mass and lifetime measurements of the most rare and simultaneously short-lived radio nuclides.</description>

      <title>Off-line Commissioning of the St. Benedict Radiofrequency Quadrupole Cooler-Buncher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The St. Benedict ion trapping system, which aims to measure the $\beta-\nu$ angular correlation parameter in superallowed-mixed mirror transitions, is under construction at the University of Notre Dame. These measurements will provide much-needed data to improve the accuracy of the $V_{ud}$ element of the CKM matrix. One of the major components of this system is the radio frequency quadrupole cooler-buncher, which is necessary to create low-emittance ion bunches for injection into the measurement Paul trap. The off-line commissioning of the cooler-buncher, using a potassium ion source, determined that the device could produce cooled ion bunches characterized by a 50-ns full-width-half-maximum time width. The commissioning results also determined the trapping efficiency to be 93(1)$\%$ and the trapping half-life to be 20.0(5) s.</description>

      <title>Development and Performance Analysis of Glass-Based Gas-Tight RPCs for Muography Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve high-resolution muography of compact targets in scenarios with complex logistical constraints, we are developing a portable muon detector system utilizing glass Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs). Although RPCs are well understood and widely used, our work focuses on developing a gas-tight variant specifically tailored for a broad range of muography applications, with key design goals including portability, robustness, autonomy, versatility, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Our RPC detectors are designed with various configurations, each featuring unique characteristics and performance attributes. We investigate the temporal evolution of the surface resistivity of glass electrodes, as well as the detector efficiency at varying voltages and thresholds, over a span of several months. These RPCs have been utilized in a small-scale feasibility study on muon absorption using lead blocks.</description>

      <title>A 55-nm SRAM Chip Scanning Errors Every 125 ns for Event-Wise Soft Error Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a 55 nm CMOS SRAM chip that scans all data every 125 ns and outputs timestamped soft error data via an SPI interface through a FIFO. The proposed system, consisting of the developed chip and particle detectors, enables event-wise soft error measurement and precise identification of SBUs and MCUs, thus resolving misclassifications such as Pseudo- and Distant MCUs that conventional methods cannot distinguish. An 80-MeV proton irradiation experiment at RASiS, Tohoku University verified the system operation. Timestamps between the SRAM chip and the particle detectors were successfully synchronized, accounting for PLL disturbances caused by radiation. Event building was achieved by determining a reset offset with sub-ns resolution, and spatial synchronization was maintained within several tens of micrometers.</description>

      <title>Production and manipulation of stable frozen hydrogen filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frozen hydrogen filaments or droplets/pellets in vacuum are of great interest as target for many experiments at hadron and lepton accelerators as well as at high-power laser systems. Especially in case of large distances between the position of target beam generation and the interaction point with an accelerator or laser beam, a high target beam stability in space and time is crucial. Here we present recent results on the long-term stability of frozen hydrogen filaments in vacuum, which have been obtained using a new cryogenic target generator. It could be shown that the trajectory of the frozen hydrogen target beam with a diameter of $10\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ remains stable for over 60 hours, with angular fluctuations below $0.08\,^\circ$. Furthermore, we present a novel strategy for the manipulation of the target beam, named cryobending. Here, the produced hydrogen filament is deflected by helium gas emerging from correction nozzles. We demonstrate the deflection of the hydrogen beam with one and two nozzles, achieving deflection angles up to $(15.7\pm 0.4)\,^\circ$. The presented results open the door for further developments of this beam position system, which enables target beam adjustment without any mechanical movement of the target components itself. Potential applications of these stable hydrogen target filaments are, e.g., the upcoming MAGIX (MAinz Gas Injection target eXperiment) or the planned $\mathrm{\bar{P}ANDA}$ (anti-Proton ANnihilation at DArmstadt) experiment.</description>

      <title>Determining 3D atomic coordinates of light-element quantum materials using ptychographic electron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum materials at the atomic scale requires precise 3D characterization of atomic positions and crystal defects. However, resolving the 3D structure of light-element materials (Z &lt;= 8) remains a major challenge due to their low contrast and beam damage in electron microscopy. Here, we demonstrate ptychographic atomic electron tomography (pAET), achieving sub-angstrom 3D atomic precision (11 pm) in light elements, marking the first-ever experimental realization of 3D atomic imaging for light-element materials. Using twisted bilayer graphene as a model system, we determine the 3D atomic coordinates of individual carbon atoms, revealing chiral lattice distortions driven by van der Waals interactions that exhibit meron-like and skyrmion-like structures. These findings provide direct insights into the interplay between 3D chiral lattice deformation and electronic properties in moire materials. Beyond TBG, pAET offers a transformative approach for 3D atomic-scale imaging across quantum materials, 2D heterostructures, functional oxides, and energy materials.</description>

      <title>Performance of plastic scintillator modules for top veto tracker at Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) experiment incorporates a top veto tracker (TVT) system comprising 160 modules, each composed of plastic scintillator (PS) strips, embedded wavelength shifting fibers (WLS-fibers), and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). This article highlights the performance of all produced modules following the production and readout/trigger design, providing insights for scintillation detectors with WLS-fibers. Three kinds of trigger modes and its efficiency have been defined to comprehensively evaluate the performance of this unique design, which has been verified for the batch production, along with comprehensive measurement strategies and quality inspection methods. In "module" mode, the detection(tagging) efficiency of the PS exceeds 99.67\% at a 30 photoelectron threshold, and even in "AND" mode, it surpasses 99.60\% at a 15 photoelectron threshold. The muon tagging efficiency meets TAO's requirements. The production and performance of the PS module set a benchmark for other experiments, with optimized optical fiber arrangements that enhance light yield and muon detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>End-to-end design of multicolor scintillators for enhanced energy resolution in X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scintillators have been widely used in X-ray imaging due to their ability to convert high-energy radiation into visible light, making them essential for applications such as medical imaging and high-energy physics. Recent advances in the artificial structuring of scintillators offer new opportunities for improving the energy resolution of scintillator-based X-ray detectors. Here, we present a three-bin energy-resolved X-ray imaging framework based on a three-layer multicolor scintillator used in conjunction with a physics-aware image postprocessing algorithm. The multicolor scintillator is able to preserve X-ray energy information through the combination of emission wavelength multiplexing and energy-dependent isolation of X-ray absorption in specific layers. The dominant emission color and the radius of the spot measured by the detector are used to infer the incident X-ray energy based on prior knowledge of the energy-dependent absorption profiles of the scintillator stack. Through ab initio Monte Carlo simulations, we show that our approach can achieve an energy reconstruction accuracy of 49.7%, which is only 2% below the maximum accuracy achievable with realistic scintillators. We apply our framework to medical phantom imaging simulations where we demonstrate that it can effectively differentiate iodine and gadolinium-based contrast agents from bone, muscle, and soft tissue.</description>

      <title>SALSA: a new versatile readout chip for MPGD detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SALSA chip is a future readout ASIC foreseen for the MPGD detectors, developed in the framework of the EIC collider project, to equip the MPGD trackers of the EPIC experiment. It is designed to be versatile, to be adapted to other usages of MPGD detectors like TPC or photon detectors. It integrates a frontend block and an ADC for each of the 64 channels, associated to a configurable DSP processor meant to correct data and reduce the raw data flux to limit the output bandwidth. It will be compatible with the continuous readout foreseen for the EPIC DAQ, but will also work in a triggered environment. Several prototypes are already produced in order to qualify the different blocks of the chip, in particular the frontend, the ADC and the clock generation. The next 32-channel prototype is currently under development and is planed to be produced in 2025. The final prototype will be produced and tested from 2026 for a production of the SALSA chip at the horizon of 2027.

      <description>arXiv:2404.18992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>

      <title>Proton reconstruction with the TOTEM Roman pot detectors for high-$\beta^*$ LHC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The TOTEM Roman pot detectors are used to reconstruct the transverse momentum of scattered protons and to estimate the transverse location of the primary interaction. This paper presents new methods of track reconstruction, measurements of strip-level detection efficiencies, cross-checks of the LHC beam optics, and detector alignment techniques, along with their application in the selection of signal collision events. The track reconstruction is performed by exploiting hit cluster information through a novel method using a common polygonal area in the intercept-slope plane. The technique is applied in the relative alignment of detector layers with $\mu$m precision. A tag-and-probe method is used to extract strip-level detection efficiencies. The alignment of the Roman pot system is performed through time-dependent adjustments, resulting in a position accuracy of 3 $\mu$m in the horizontal and 60 $\mu$m in the vertical directions. The goal is to provide an optimal reconstruction tool for central exclusive physics analyses based on the high-$\beta^*$ data-taking period at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in 2018.</description>
