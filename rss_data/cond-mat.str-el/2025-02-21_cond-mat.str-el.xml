      <title>Dumbbell Fermions and Spin Models on Honeycomb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>

      <title>Purely Electronic Chirality without Structural Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of purely electronic chirality, which arises in the absence of structural chirality. In condensed matter physics and chemistry, chirality has conventionally been understood as a mirror-image asymmetry in crystal or molecular structures. We demonstrate that certain electronic orders exhibit chirality-related properties without atomic displacement. Specifically, we investigate quadrupole orders to realize such purely electronic chirality with handedness that can be tuned by magnetic fields. As a representative example, we analyze a model featuring $120^\circ$ antiferro quadrupole orders on a distorted kagom\'e lattice, predicting various chirality-related responses in the nonmagnetic ordered phase of URhSn. Furthermore, as a phonon analog, chiral phonons can emerge in achiral crystals through coupling with the pEC order. Our results provide a distinct origin of chirality and a fundamental basis for exploring the interplay between electronic and structural chirality.</description>

      <title>Critical theories connecting gapped phases with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry from the duality web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the ideas behind the duality web to construct numerous conformal field theories mediating the phase transitions between various symmetry broken and topological phases. In particular we obtain the full field theory version of the Kennedy Tasaki transformation, mapping a gapless theory mediating a topological phase transition of symmetry protected topological orders to a standard symmetry breaking one in a 1+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. When we consider all possible discrete gauging operations, we obtain bosonic and fermionic webs with 9 critical theories per web, each connecting 4 separate gapped phases, some of them topological. Bosonization maps the two webs into each other. In addition to discussing the multi-critical theory connecting the four gapped phases in each phase diagram, we discuss the partially gapped theories connecting two of those four. Some of these are gapless symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Elastic Quantum Criticality in Nematics and Altermagnets via the Elasto-Caloric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between electronic nematic degrees of freedom and acoustic phonons is known to significantly alter the universality class of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP). While non-Fermi-liquid behaviour emerges in the absence of lattice coupling, the inclusion of interactions with acoustic phonons results in observables such as heat capacity and single-particle scattering rate exhibiting only subleading non-analytic corrections to dominant Fermi-liquid terms. In this work, we demonstrate that the elastocaloric effect (ECE) -- the adiabatic temperature change under varying strain -- and the thermal expansion deviate from this pattern. Despite lattice coupling weakening the singularity of the ECE, it preserves a dominant non-Fermi-liquid temperature dependence. By drawing analogies between nematic systems and field-tuned altermagnets, we further show that similar responses are expected for the ECE near altermagnetic QCPs. We classify the types of piezomagnetic couplings and analyse the regimes arising from field-tuned magnetoelastic interactions. Our findings are shown to be consistent with the scaling theory for elastic quantum criticality and they further emphasize the suitability of the ECE as a sensitive probe near QCPs.</description>

      <title>Projected and Solvable Topological Heavy Fermion Model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) in the projected limit, where only the flat bands are present in the low-energy spectrum. Such limit has been previously analyzed in momentum-space Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum models, but not in a real-space formalism. In this regime, the Hubbard interaction ($U_1$) of the $f$-electrons is larger than the bandwidth ($2M$) of the flat bands but smaller than the gap ($\gamma$) between the flat and remote bands. In the THF model, concentrated charge (in real space) and concentrated Berry curvature (in momentum space) are respectively realized by exponentially localized $f$-orbitals and itinerant Dirac $c$-electrons. Local moments naturally arise from $f$-orbitals. Hybridizing the $f$-electrons with $c$-electrons produces power-law tails of the flat-band Wannier functions, raising the question of relevance of the local moment picture in the projected $U_1\ll \gamma$ limit. Nonetheless, we find that the local moments remain stable as long as $U_1 \gg \Delta(\omega)$ for $|\omega|\lesssim U_1$, where $\Delta(\omega)\sim \gamma^2 N(\omega)$ is the hybridization function seen by each $f$-site, and $N(\omega)$ is the density of states of the Dirac $c$-bands. Notably, the comparison between $U_1$ and $\gamma$ is irrelevant to the local moment formation if $N(\omega)$ is unknown. Within the framework of THF, we also derive the correlated self-energy of the flat bands using the Hubbard-I approximation and estimate the coupling strength between the local moments. Finally, we comment that, in the regime of extremely concentrated Berry curvature, the single-particle gap between flat bands and remote bands vanishes and the interaction is always larger than the gap.</description>

      <title>Towards a global phase diagram of Ce-based dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets under magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have established a strong case for Ce$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf)$_2$O$_7$ to host $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). However, an irrefutable conclusion still requires strong, multifaceted evidence. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) compounds, external magnetic fields only strongly couple with the dipolar component $\tau_z$ along its local z-axis in contrast to octupolar components $\tau^{x,y}$. This gives rise to the unique ways magnetic fields interact with the system and, in turn, provides us with a variety of tuning knobs to generate comprehensive experimental results. In this work, we focus on magnetic fields along the (110), (111), and (001) directions and present a plethora of remarkable experimental signatures to probe the underlying physics of $\pi$-flux QSI using gauge mean field theory (GMFT) and Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we present unique signatures in magnetic field-dependent phase diagrams, equal-time and dynamical structure factors, and magnetostriction.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin liquid phase in the Shastry-Sutherland model revealed by high-precision infinite projected entangled-pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shastry-Sutherland model is an effective model of the layered material SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, which exhibits an extremely rich phase diagram as a function of pressure and magnetic field. Motivated by the recent controversy regarding its phase diagram at zero magnetic field, we perform large-scale simulations based on infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS), a two-dimensional tensor network ansatz to represent the ground state directly in the thermodynamic limit. By employing the latest optimization techniques, we obtain variational states with lower energy than previous results obtained from other methods. Using systematic extrapolations to the exact infinite bond dimension limit, our simulations reveal a narrow quantum spin liquid phase between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic phases in the range $0.785(5) \le J'/J \le 0.82(1)$.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic and bond-order-wave phases in the half-filled two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions arise in many strongly correlated quantum materials from the modulation of the nearest-neighbor hopping integrals, as in the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Nevertheless, relatively few non-perturbative studies of correlated SSH models have been conducted in dimensions greater than one, and those that have been done have primarily focused on bond models, where generalized displacements independently modulate each hopping integral. We conducted a sign-problem free determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of the optical SSH-Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice, where site-centered phonon modes simultaneously modulate pairs of nearest-neighbor hopping integrals. We report the model's low-temperature phase diagram in the challenging adiabatic regime ($\Omega/E_\mathrm{F} \sim 1/8$). It exhibits insulating antiferromagnetic Mott and bond-order-wave (BOW) phases with a narrow region of coexistence between them. We also find that a critical $e$-ph coupling is required to stabilize the BOW phase in the small $U$ limit. Lastly, in stark contrast to recent findings for the model's bond variant, we find no evidence for a long-range antiferromagnetism in the pure $(U/t=0)$ optical SSH model.</description>

      <title>Theoretical studies on the spin-charge dynamics in Kondo-lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo-lattice model describes a typical spin-charge coupled system in which localized spins and itinerant electrons are strongly coupled via exchange interactions and exhibits a variety of long-wavelength magnetic orders originating from the nesting of Fermi surfaces. Recently, several magnetic materials that realize this model have been discovered experimentally, and they have turned out to exhibit rich topological magnetic phases including skyrmion crystals and hedgehog lattices. Our recent theoretical studies based on the large-scale spin-dynamics simulations have revealed several interesting nonequilibrium phenomena and excitation dynamics in the Kondo-lattice model, e.g., dynamical magnetic topology switching and peculiar spin-wave modes of the skyrmion crystals and the hedgehog lattices under irradiation with electromagnetic waves such as microwaves and light. These achievements are expected to open a new research field to explore novel nonequilibrium topological phenomena and related material functions of the spin-charge coupled magnets.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Intermediate Nematic State in a Bilayer Kagome Metal ScV6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematicity, where rotational symmetry of the crystal lattice is spontaneously broken, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in correlated quantum matter, often intertwining with other orders to produce a richer spectrum of phases. Here we report a new phase transition in high-quality ScV6Sn6 bilayer kagome metal at a temperature T^*, occurring seven Kelvins below the charge density wave (CDW) transition at T_CDW, as indicated by thermodynamic, transport, and optical measurements. This emerging intermediate phase does not exhibit spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking, as evidenced by zero-field Sagnac interferometer experiments. However, it displays a strong, spontaneous (strain- and field-free) anisotropy in the kagome plane between T^* and T_CDW, as revealed by transport and optical polarization rotation measurements. Additionally, a pronounced depolarization effect detected by the Sagnac interferometer further confirms its nematic nature. This intermediate nematic phase, alongside the recently discovered intra-unit cell nematic order at much lower temperatures, presents a diverse landscape of nematicities at multiple length and temperature scales, distinguishing it from those observed in kagome metals AV3Sb5. Our findings highlight ScV6Sn6 and the broader RM6X6 intermetallic family as fertile platforms for realizing symmetry-breaking phases driven by a unique interplay of competing CDW instabilities, kagome physics, and Van Hove singularities.</description>

      <title>Emergent Goldstone flat bands and spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a quantum many-body spin system undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes, a high degree of degeneracy arises in the ground state manifold. Generically, if this degeneracy is polynomial in system size, then it does not depend on the type of boundary conditions used. However, if there exists an emergent (local) symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state, then we show that the degeneracies are exponential in system size and are different under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and open boundary conditions (OBCs). We further show that the exponential ground state degeneracies in turn imply the emergence of Goldstone flat bands -- single-mode excitations generated by a multi-site operator and its images under the repeated action of the translation operation under PBCs or the cyclic permutation symmetry operation under OBCs. Conversely, we also show that the presence of emergent Goldstone flat bands implies that there exists an emergent (local) symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground state. In addition, we propose an extrinsic characterization of emergent Goldstone flat bands, revealing a connection to quantum many-body scars, which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We illustrate this by presenting examples from the staggered ${\rm SU}(4)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model and the staggered ${\rm SU}(4)$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital model. We also perform extensive numerical simulations for the more general ${\rm SO}(3)$ spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic and ${\rm SO(4)}$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital models, containing the two aforementioned models as the endpoints in the ferromagnetic regimes respectively, and confirm the emergence of Goldstone flat bands, as we approach these endpoints from deep inside the ferromagnetic regimes.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>The origin and scarcity of breathing pyrochlore lattices in spinel oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathing pyrochlores are a unique class of materials characterized by a three-dimensional lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra. However, unlike conventional pyrochlores where all tetrahedra are identical in size, the breathing pyrochlore lattice is composed of alternating large and small tetrahedra. Experimental realizations of the breathing pyrochlore lattice are rare but they do occur in $A$-site ordered spinels, as in the prototype materials LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$. In this work, we demonstrate that Cr cannot be straightforwardly substituted with other magnetic transition metals while retaining the breathing pyrochlore structure. To explain this observation, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the formation and stability of LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$, focusing on the energy scales associated with $A$ and $B$-site orderings as well as the magnetic exchange interactions of Cr ions. We identify the strong octahedral site preference of Cr$^{3+}$ as a key factor in protecting the structural integrity of the pyrochlore sublattice, which in turn enables the breathing distortion to proceed. We also demonstrate that the charge order between the $A$ (Li) and $A'$ sites (Ga or In) is maintained at all temperatures up to decomposition. Furthermore, while the magnetic exchange interactions constitute a relatively small energy scale and therefore do not play a fundamental role in the structural stability of LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$, magnetism may play a critical role in setting the magnitude of the tetrahedral distortion. Ultimately, we conclude that the scarcity of breathing pyrochlores is a consequence of the stringent requirement on site ordering for their formation.</description>

Abstract: Traditional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from the irreducible representations (irreps) $V_{\lambda}$ of the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps $\{\lambda_\ell\}$ and monomer tensors on sites labeled by $\{\lambda_s\}$. These tensors naturally define a local site Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}^g_s$, on which gauge transformations act. Gauss's law introduces an additional index $\alpha_s = 1, 2, \dots, \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H}_s^g)$ that labels an orthonormal basis of the gauge-invariant subspace of $\mathcal{H}^g_s$. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis, $\left| \{\lambda_s\},\{\lambda_\ell\},\{\alpha_s\}\right\rangle$, of the physical Hilbert space enables the construction of new qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs. Here, we investigate finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement transitions in a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory in $d=2$ and $d=3$ spatial dimensions, formulated using the MDTN basis, and show that they reproduce the universal results of traditional LGTs at these transitions. Additionally, in $d=1$, we demonstrate using a plaquette chain that the string tension at zero temperature can be continuously tuned to zero by adjusting a model parameter that plays the role of the gauge coupling in traditional LGTs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Pressure and Apical Oxygen Vacancies on Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has recently emerged as a promising system for high-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC). In this work, we investigate the fate of the SC properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the SC pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new phase in thin flakes of KV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results of magnetotransport measurements on KV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes under pressure. Our zero-field electrical resistance reveals an additional anomaly emerging under pressure ($p$), marking a previously unidentified phase boundary $T^{\rm \ast}$($p$). Together with the established $T_{\rm CDW}(p)$ and $T_c(p)$, denoting the charge-density-wave transition and a superconducting transition, respectively, the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ features a rich interplay among multiple phases. The Hall coefficient evolves reasonably smoothly when crossing the $T^{\rm \ast}$ phase boundary compared with the variation when crossing $T_{\rm CDW}$, indicating the preservation of the pristine electronic structure. The mobility spectrum analysis provides further insights into distinguishing different phases. Finally, our high-pressure quantum oscillation studies up to 31 T combined with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the new phase does not reconstruct the Fermi surface, confirming that the translational symmetry of the pristine metallic state is preserved.</description>

      <title>Isotropic superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence of superconductivity (SC) has recently been reported in pressurized La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, providing a new platform to explore high-temperature superconductivity. However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial damping of magnetization currents in perturbed spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since perturbations are omnipresent in physics, understanding their impact on the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is a vitally important but notoriously difficult question. On the one hand, random-matrix and typicality arguments suggest a rather simple damping in the overwhelming majority of cases, e.g., exponential damping according to Fermi's Golden Rule. On the other hand, counterexamples are known to exist, and it remains unclear how frequent and under which conditions such counterexamples appear. In our work, we consider the spin-1/2 XXZ chain as a paradigmatic example of a quantum many-body system and study the dynamics of the magnetization current in the easy-axis regime. Using numerical simulations based on dynamical quantum typicality, we show that the standard autocorrelation function is damped in a nontrivial way and that only a modified version of this function is damped in a simple manner. Employing projection-operator techniques in addition, we demonstrate that both, the nontrivial and simple damping relation can be understood on perturbative grounds. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings for the particle current in the Hubbard chain.</description>

      <title>Exploring the phase diagram of $SU(2)_4$ strange correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a quantum many-body system constructed via the strange correlator approach, based on the non-Abelian $SU(2)_4$ fusion category, to probe topological phase transitions. Using tensor network methods, we numerically compute the half-infinite chain entanglement entropy derived from the dominant eigenvector of the transfer matrix and map the entropy across a spherical two-dimensional parameter space. Our results reveal a phase diagram significantly more complex than previously reported, including a gapless phase consistent with a conformal field theory (CFT) of central charge $c=1$. Critical lines separating distinct phases are identified, with one such line bounding the CFT phase exhibiting a higher central charge $c=2$, indicative of an unconventional critical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric conformal quantum field theories (SCFTs) with degrees of freedom labeled by lattice data. We will assume that in terms of the corresponding lattice the interactions are nearest neighbor and exactly marginal. For example, one can construct such theories by coupling many copies of a single SCFT with exactly marginal deformations. In particular, we discuss the interplay between conformal manifolds of such theories and their global, on-site and lattice, symmetries. We show that one can interpret certain current non-conservation equations for symmetries broken by the interactions as conservation equations including the lattice directions. Moreover, we discuss a class of exactly marginal deformations which are labeled by lattice holonomies that are topological on the lattice. We discuss concrete examples of such constructions and comment on their relevance to compactifications of SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Favored Anisotropic Phase Stiffness in Infinite-Layer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unconventional superconductors such as cuprates and iron pnictides and chalcogenides, phase stiffness - a measure of the energy cost associated with superconducting phase variations - is on the same order of magnitude as the strength of Cooper pairing, translating to superconductivity governed by phase fluctuations. However, due to a lack of a direct experimental probe, there remains a fundamental gap in establishing microscopic picture between unconventional superconductivity and phase fluctuations. Here we show a vector current technique that allows for in-situ angle-resolved transport measurements, providing exclusive evidence suggesting an anisotropic nature of phase stiffness in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors. Pronounced anisotropy of in-plane resistance manifests itself in both normal and superconducting transition states, indicating crystal symmetry breaking. Remarkably, the electric conductivity of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 peaks at 125{\deg} between the direction of the current and crystal principal axis, but this angle evolves to 160{\deg} near zero-resistance temperature. Further measurements reveal that the superconductivity is favored along a direction with minimized phase fluctuations, an orientation strikingly deviating from the symmetric direction imposed by both electronic anisotropy and the underlying crystal lattice. Identical measurements conducted on a prototypical cuprate superconductor yield consistent results, suggesting that this previously unknown behavior could be ubiquitous. By shielding insight into the contrasting anisotropy between electron fluid and superfluid, our findings provide clues for a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductors</description>

      <title>Slave-spin approach to the Anderson-Josephson quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a strongly interacting quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads using a slave-spin representation of the dot. At the mean-field level the problem maps into a resonant level model with superconducting leads, coupled to an auxiliary spin-1/2 variable accounting for the parity of the dot. We obtain the mean-field phase diagram, showing a transition between a Kondo (singlet) and a local moment (doublet) regime, corresponding to the $0-\pi$ transition of the junction. The mean-field theory qualitatively captures the Kondo singlet phase and its competition with superconductivity for weak values of the BCS gap, including the non-trivial dependence of the Andreev bound states on the interaction, but fails in the doublet regime where it predicts a dot decoupled from the bath. Using diagrammatic techniques and a random phase approximation, we include fluctuations on top of the mean-field theory to describe finite-frequency dynamics of the effective spin variable. This leads to the formation of high-energy Hubbard bands in the spectral function and a coherent Kondo peak with a BCS gap at low energies. Finally, we compute the Josephson current and the induced superconducting correlations on the dot.</description>

      <title>Low-spin ground state of the giant single-molecule magnets {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$}</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-molecule magnets {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$} are characterized by a 14-site unit cell with $S=2$ spin sites arranged in a circular geometry. Experimentally, these systems exhibit a magnetic ground state with a notably low total spin $S_{\text{tot}}=5-7$. Up to now, this low-spin ground state has been up difficult to describe theoretically due to the complexity of the quantum Heisenberg model for such a large system. In this work, we fill this gap and demonstrate that the ground state of {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$} is in fact governed by a small, finite $S_{\text{tot}}$ in quantitative agreement with the experiment. We employ accurate, large-scale SU(2)-symmetric density-matrix renormalization group calculations for a quantum Heisenberg model with previously published exchange parameters obtained by density-functional theory. We do not find a low-spin state for the same parameters and $S=1$ and thus propose that frustrated systems with $S\geq2$ are inherently prone to weak ferromagnetic interactions. This could account for the prevalence of similar low-spin Mn-based single-molecule magnets. Finally, we compute the full magnetization curve and find wide plateaus at 10/14, 11/14, 12/14 and 13/14 of the saturation, which can be traced back to nearly-independent 3-site clusters with broken inter-cluster bonds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy physics of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) is controlled by the Luttinger parameter. We demonstrate that this parameter can be extracted from a single wave function for one-component TLLs with periodic boundary condition. This method relies on the fact that TLLs are described by conformal field theory in which crosscap states can be constructed. The overlaps between the crosscap states and the ground state as well as some excited states are proved to be universal numbers that directly reveal the Luttinger parameter. In microscopic lattice models, crosscap states are formed by putting each pair of antipodal sites into a maximally entangled state. Analytical and numerical calculations are performed in a few representative models to substantiate the conformal field theory prediction. The extracted Luttinger parameters are generally quite accurate in finite-size systems with moderate lengths, so there is no need to perform data fitting and/or finite-size scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zintl phase EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ has garnered growing attention as an axion insulator candidate, triggered by the identification of a commensurate double-${\mathbf Q}$ broken-helix state in previous studies, however, its periodicity and symmetry remain subjects of debate. Here, we perform resonant x-ray scattering experiments on EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, revealing an incommensurate nature of the broken-helix state, where both the wave number and the amplitude of the helical modulation exhibit systematic sample dependence. Furthermore, the application of an in-plane magnetic field brings about a fanlike state that appears to preserve the double-${\mathbf Q}$ nature, which might be attributed to multiple-spin interactions in momentum space. We propose that the itinerant character of EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, most likely induced by Eu deficiency, gives rise to the helical modulation and impedes the realization of a theoretically-predicted axion state with the collinear antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Haldane Map from the Matrix Product State Path Integral to the Critical Theory of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1/2$ chain using a path integral constructed over matrix product states (MPS). By virtue of its non-trivial entanglement structure, the MPS ansatz captures the key phases of the model even at a semi-classical, saddle-point level, and, as a variational state, is in good agreement with the field theory obtained by abelian bosonisation. Going beyond the semi-classical level, we show that the MPS ansatz facilitates a physically-motivated derivation of the field theory of the critical phase: by carefully taking the continuum limit -- a generalisation of the Haldane map -- we recover from the MPS path integral a field theory with the correct topological term and emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, constructively linking the microscopic states and topological field-theoretic structures. Moreover, the dimerisation transition is particularly clear in the MPS formulation -- an explicit dimerisation potential becomes relevant, gapping out the magnetic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Altermagnetic Phases through Quantum Oscillations</title>

Abstract: The recently delimited altermagnetic phase is characterized by zero net magnetization but momentum-dependent collinear spin-splitting. To explore the intriguing physical effects and potential applications of altermagnets, it is essential to analyze their Fermi surface properties, encompassing both configurations and spin textures. Here, we conduct a Fermiology study on metallic altermagnets and demonstrate that the collinear spin-split features of their Fermi surfaces can be clearly revealed through quantum oscillation measurements. By introducing a transverse Zeeman field to remove the spin-degenerate lines in the momentum space, the Fermi surface undergoes a Lifshitz transition, giving rise to spin-flipped cyclotron motion between orbits with opposite spins. Accordingly, the Lifshitz-Onsager quantization yields two sets of Landau levels, leading to frequency splitting of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in conductivity. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the Zeeman field causes two separate cyclotron orbits to merge at the Lifshitz transition point before splitting again. This results in the two original frequencies discontinuously changing into a single frequency equal to their sum. Our work unveils a unique and universal signature of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces that can be probed through quantum oscillation measurements.</description>

      <title>Higher-Rank Spin Liquids and Spin Nematics from Competing Orders in Pyrochlore Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pyrochlore magnets have proven to provide an excellent arena for the realization of a variety of many-body phenomena such as classical and quantum order-by-disorder, as well as spin liquid phases described by emergent gauge field theories. These phenomena arise from the competition between different symmetry-breaking magnetic orders. In this work, we consider a subspace of the most general bilinear nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice, parameterized by the local interaction parameter $J_{z\pm}$, where three symmetry-breaking phases converge. We demonstrate that for small values of $|J_{z\pm}|$, a conventional $\mathbf q=0$ ordered phase is selected by a thermal order-by-disorder mechanism. For $|J_{z\pm}|$ above a certain finite threshold, a novel spin-nematic phase is stabilized at low temperatures. Instead of the usual Bragg peaks, the spin-nematic phase features lines of high intensity in the spin structure factor. At intermediate temperatures above the low-temperature orders, a rank-2 U(1) classical spin liquid is realized for all $J_{z\pm} \neq 0$. We fully characterize all phases using classical Monte-Carlo simulations and a self-consistent Gaussian approximation.</description>

      <title>Ferrimagnetism from triple-q order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The candidate Kitaev magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ exhibits a characteristic ferrimagnetic response at low temperatures, with a finite residual magnetization that changes sign at a compensation point located at around half the ordering temperature. We argue that the behavior can be naturally understood to arise in this material as a consequence of a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic ground state. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we study the finite-temperature response of the pertinent honeycomb Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model in weak training fields. Our model features all symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, as well as sublattice-dependent next-nearest-neighbor interactions, consistent with the reported crystal structure of the material. We also consider a six-spin ring exchange perturbation, which allows us to tune between the two different magnetic long-range orders that have been suggested for this material in the literature, namely, a collinear single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag state and a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ state. We demonstrate that the experimentally-observed ferrimagnetic response of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ can be well described within our modeling if the magnetic ground state features noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order. The observation of a compensation point, where the residual magnetization reverses sign, suggests a sublattice $g$-factor anisotropy, with a larger out-of-plane $g$-factor on the sublattice with stronger antiferromagnetic intrasublattice exchange. By contrast, a classical Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$-type model with collinear zigzag ground state is insufficient even in principle to describe the observed behavior. Our results illustrate the unconventional physics of noncollinear magnetic long-range orders hosted by frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Broadening of Phonon Spectral Function in Classical Lattice Models: Projective Truncation Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal broadening of the quasi-particle peak in the spectral function is an important physical feature in many statistical systems, but it is difficult to calculate. To tackle this problem, we propose the $H$-expanded basis within the projective truncation approximation (PTA) of the Green's function equation of motion. A zeros-removing technique is introduced to stabilize the iterative solution of the PTA equations. Benchmarking calculations on the classical one-variable anharmonic oscillator model and the one-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice model show that the thermal broadened quasi-particle peak in the spectral function can be produced on a semi-quantitative level. Using this method, we discuss the low- and high- temperature power-law behaviors of the spectral width $\Gamma_k(T)$ of the one-dimensional $\phi^4$ model, finding it in contradiction with the assumption of effective phonon theory. A short-chain limit of this model is also discovered. Issues of extending the $H$-expanded basis to quantum systems and of the applicability of the Debye formula for thermal conductivity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Single-boson exchange formulation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and its application to the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality of Type-I and Critically Tilted Dirac Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of an Ising symmetry breaking phase transition of tilted two-dimensional Dirac fermions, in the type-I phase as well as at the Lifshitz transition between a type-I and a type-II semimetal, where the Fermi surface changes from point-like to one with electron and hole pockets that touch at the overtilted Dirac cones. We compute the Landau damping of long-wavelength order parameter fluctuations by tilted Dirac fermions and use the resulting IR propagator as input for a renormalisation-group analysis of the resulting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory. We first demonstrate that the criticality of tilted type-I fermions is controlled by a line of fixed points along which the poles of the renormalised Green function correspond to an untilted Dirac spectrum with varying anisotropy of Fermi velocities. At the phase transition the Lorentz invariance is restored, resulting in the same critical exponents as for conventional Dirac systems. The multicritical point is given by the endpoint of the fixed-point line. It can be approached along any path in parameter space that avoids the fixed point line of the critical type-I semimetal. We show that the critical exponents at the Lifshitz point are different and that Lorentz invariance is broken.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>

      <title>Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model with Weyl magnons and nodal-line magnons ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) in a collinear altermagnet on the honeycomb lattice. Altermagnetic magnon bands can be realized by breaking the symmetry of the second nearest neighbor exchange couplings without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition to the Chern number and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, chirality is important to describe the magnon topology. The model shows the nonzero magnon spin Nernst effect when a longitudinal temperature gradient exists. We calculate the differential gyromagnetic ratio induced purely by the topology of altermagnetic magnons, which can be probed through the Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Transition between critical antiferromagnetic phases in the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $J_1$--$J_2$ spin chain is one of the canonical models of quantum magnetism, and has long been known to host a critical antiferromagnetic phase with power-law decay of spin correlations. We show in this letter that there are, in fact, two distinct critical phases: the `Affleck-Haldane' phase, where the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint $O(4)$ N\'eel-singlet order parameter; and the `Zirnbauer' phase, where the dimer field is gapped out and the critical theory involves only an $O(3)$ N\'eel order parameter. The phases are so-named because each realises one of the competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.</description>
