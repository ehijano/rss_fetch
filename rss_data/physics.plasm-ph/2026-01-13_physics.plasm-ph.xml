      <title>Hidden free energy released by explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the familiar two-stream instability is the result of spontaneous parity-time (PT)-symmetry breaking in a conservative system, and more importantly, explicit PT-symmetry breaking by viscosity can destabilize the system in certain parameter regimes that are stable when viscosity vanishes. This reveals that complex systems may possess hidden free energies protected by PT-symmetry and viscosity, albeit dissipative, can expose the systems to these freed energies by breaking PT-symmetry explicitly. Such a process is accompanied by instability and total variation growth.</description>

      <title>Guiding-center dynamics in a screw-pinch magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The guiding-center dynamics of charged particles moving in a doubly-symmetric screw-pinch magnetic field is investigated. In particular, we verify that Kruskal's adiabatic-invariant series expansion of the radial action integral associated with the reduced full-orbit radial motion matches the perturbation expansion of the magnetic-moment gyroaction up to first order in magnetic-field non-uniformity. Because the radial action integral is an exact invariant of the full-orbit dynamics, the magnetic moment is therefore represented as non-perturbative integral expression, which can be used to test the validity of the guiding-center approximation.</description>

      <title>Discharge characteristics and parameter diagnosis of dielectric barrier discharge patterns in double-gap configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern discharge is a common mode in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and has broad application prospects in various industrial fields, such as material surface treatment, environmental monitoring, and biomedical applications. In this work, a mixed gas of 75% argon and 25% air is used to generate a pattern discharge. A double-gap boundary composed of hexagonal configuration and square configuration is employed, and the gas pressure is fixed at 20 kPa. By varying the applied voltage amplitude, single-ring pattern, square-point-line pattern, square lattice pattern, and annular-lattice pattern are obtained for the first time. The discharge characteristics and their temporal correlation are studied using both optical method and electrical method. The results show that the discharge patterns exhibit multiple discharges in each half of the voltage cycle, and these discharges are temporally correlated with each other. Time-resolved discharge images of the square lattice pattern are captured using an enhanced charge-coupled device (ICCD). The experimental results reveal that multiple discharges in a half-voltage cycle correspond to the ignition process of the pattern in the radial direction from the outside to the inside. The morphology of the square lattice pattern observed by the naked eye is actually the result of the temporal superposition of luminescence from points at different positions in the evolution process.</description>

      <title>Effect of LH and ECR waves on plasma parameters in ADITYA Upgrade tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasma discharges in ADITYA Upgrade Tokamak are produced by means of transformer action, in which Ohmically created plasma is driven by means of a secondary loop voltage. Due to reduction of plasma resistivity after a certain level of plasma temperature, Ohmic heating becomes poor and further achievement of temperature needs other heating techniques. ADITYA-U tokamak is facilitated with a 42 GHz-500 kW Electron Cyclotron Resonant Heating (ECRH) system. Also, there is a Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system installed and operated at 3.7 GHz for driving non-inductive plasma current followed by the Ohmic current drive. Though an eventual impact in the rise of plasma temperature and plasma current due to the application of ECRH and LHCD respectively are very obvious, their energy coupling with the plasma results in several interesting outcomes in a number of experimentally measured plasma parameters. The present work addresses such impactful observations that are noticed and reported for the first time in ADITYA-U Tokamak.</description>

      <title>Control of Electron Energy Distribution Functions by Current Waveform Tailoring in Inductively Coupled Radio Frequency Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations a novel approach towards Electron Energy Probability Function (EEPF) and plasma chemistry control by Current Waveform Tailoring (CWT) in the coil of inductively coupled discharges is proposed. Varying the shape of this current waveform provides electrical control of the dynamics of the electric field in the plasma. Using sawtooth instead of sinusoidal waveforms allows breaking and controlling the temporal symmetry of the electric field dynamics. In this way CWT allows controlling the EEPF, the ionization-to-excitation rate ratio, and the plasma chemistry.</description>

      <title>A radiation two-phase flow model for simulating plasma-liquid interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In laser-produced plasma (LPP) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources, deformation of a tin droplet into an optimal target shape is governed by its interaction with a pre-pulse laser-generated plasma. This interaction is mediated by a transient ablation pressure, whose complex spatio-temporal evolution remains experimentally inaccessible. Existing modeling approaches are limited: Empirical pressure-impulse models neglect dynamic plasma feedback, while advanced radiation-hydrodynamic codes often fail to resolve late-time droplet hydrodynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a radiation two-phase flow model based on a diffuse interface methodology. The model integrates radiation hydrodynamics for the plasma with the Euler equations for a weakly compressible liquid, extending a five-equation diffuse interface formulation to incorporate radiation transport, thermal conduction, and ionization. This formulation enforces pressure and velocity equilibrium across the diffuse interface region, with closure models constructed to ensure correct jump conditions at interfaces and asymptotically recover the pure-phase equations in bulk regions. Then, we apply the model to simulate a benchmark pre-pulse scenario, where a 50 micron tin droplet is irradiated by a 10 ns laser pulse. The simulations capture the rapid plasma expansion and subsequent inertial flattening of the droplet into a thin, curved sheet over microsecond timescales. Notably, the model reproduces experimentally observed features (such as an axial jet) rarely replicated in prior simulations. Quantitative agreement with experimental data for sheet dimensions and velocity validates the approach. The proposed model self-consistently couples laser-plasma physics with compressible droplet dynamics, providing a powerful tool for fundamental studies of plasma-liquid interactions in LPP-EUV source optimization.</description>

      <title>Role of Shafranov shift, zonal structures on the behavior of TAEs, AAEs and microinstabilities in the presence of energetic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future nuclear fusion reactors, even a small fraction of fusion-born energetic particles (EP) about 100 times hotter than the thermal bulk species, contributes substantially to the kinetic pressure and therefore affect the MHD equilibrium, mainly via the Shafranov shift. In this work, we perform first-principles numerical simulations using the gyrokinetic, electromagnetic, global code ORB5 to study the effect of a self-consistent finite $\beta$ equilibrium on the arising Alfv\'en Eigenmodes (destabilized by EPs), Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG), and Kinetic Ballooning Modes (KBM) microturbulence (destabilized by thermal species). Linearly, we explore the complex interplay between EP fraction, bulk gradients and a self-consistent Shafranov shift on the plasma stability. We choose single toroidal mode numbers to represent the system's instabilities and study the characteristic nonlinear evolutions of TAEs, KBMs and ITGs separately and including the axisymmetric field response to each mode separately. This study focuses on the impact of Shafranov shift equilibrium consistency, as well as the self-generated zonal ${E \times B}$ flows, the saturation levels and resulting heat and particle fluxes. In the ITG cases including the $n=0$ perturbations reduces turbulent fluxes, as expected, however, for the TAE cases including the $n=0$ perturbations is shown to enhance the fluxes. We show for the first time that Axisymmetric Alfv\'en Eigenmodes (AAEs) play a role in this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Generation of High Order Harmonics in Vacuum for Various Configurations of Interacting Electromagnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High order harmonic (HOH) generation by interacting extremely intense electromagnetic waves in the quantum vacuum is investigated within the framework of the Heisenberg-Euler formalism. We consider here the process in the lowest order of a perturbation theory relative to the electromagnetic (EM) beam intensity, giving contribution to the HOH generation. The main expressions are obtained for a general geometry, whyle polarizations of different sub-beams forming the EM beam focus are almost the same. Nevertheless, explicit expressions for the HOH generation are derived for the $4\pi$-dipole in-coming waves and for the two crossing Gaussian beams. The former geometry of the EM beam is optimal at a given EM wave power, whereas the latter one is more realistic from the experimental point of view. We consider also a relationship of our present general results with the results, obtained earlier for the HOH generation during of collision of two plane electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear anisotropic equilibrium reconstruction in axisymmetric magnetic mirrors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction is a crucial simulation capability for interpreting diagnostic measurements of experimental plasmas. Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $\beta = 2\mu_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$\beta$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $\beta$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of magnetic fields from ferromagnetic materials near strong electromagnets, and application to stellarator coil optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fusion reactor design, steels under consideration for the blanket are ferromagnetic, so the steel's effect on the plasma physics must be examined. For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability. Moreover, it is straightforward to differentiate through the model to get the derivative of the field with respect to the electromagnet parameters. We thereby demonstrate gradient-based coil optimization for a quasi-isodynamic stellarator in which the field contribution from a ferromagnetic blanket is included. Even a significant steel volume is found to have little impact on the plasma physics properties, with the main effects being a slight destabilization of ballooning modes and a radial shift of the edge islands due to decrease in rotational transform. Both issues are corrected by minor reoptimization of the coil shapes to account for the field from the steel.</description>

      <title>Optimization of laser-driven proton acceleration in a near-critical-density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing laser and plasma parameters is crucial for enhancing accelerated proton energy in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. Tight focusing plays a significant role in improving laser-driven proton acceleration, which is generally believed as a result of the enhancement of laser intensity. However, we find that even at a fixed laser intensity, reducing the focal spot size still enhances the proton energy. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at a small spot size (0.8 {\mu}m), the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 56.3% compared to that obtained at a conventional spot size (3 {\mu}m). This improvement is attributed to the dominance of ponderomotive-force-driven electrons at reduced spot sizes, which generate stronger charge-separation fields that propagate at higher velocities. Furthermore, to optimize proton acceleration, we analytically derive an ideal plasma density profile that promotes phase-stable proton acceleration, yielding an additional energy increase of 61.3% over the case of a tightly focused laser interacting with a planar target of uniform density. These findings remain robust under parameter variations, indicating that advanced focusing techniques combined with optimized plasma profiles could relax the demand for high laser energies, thereby reducing the reliance on large-scale laser facilities in medical and scientific applications.</description>

Abstract: Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.
  Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.
  The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.
  The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Similarities in the Initiation of Upward Positive and Downward Negative Lightning Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the S\"{a}ntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between the "Category A" and "B" pulses associated with the initial continuous current of upward negative leaders, and the "Classical" and "Narrow" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest that similar physical processes may be involved in the early stages of negative leader development in both upward and downward lightning, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.</description>
