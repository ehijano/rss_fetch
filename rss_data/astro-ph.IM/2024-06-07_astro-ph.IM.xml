      <title>Learning from the present for the future: the Juelich LOFAR Long-term Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Forschungszentrum Juelich has been hosting the German part of the LOFAR archive since 2013. It is Germany's most extensive radio astronomy archive, currently storing nearly 22 petabytes (PB) of data. Future radio telescopes are expected to require a dramatic increase in long-term data storage. Here, we take stock of the current data management of the Juelich LOFAR Data Archive, describe the ingestion, the storage system, the export to the long-term archive, and the request chain. We analysed the data availability over the last 10 years and searched for the underlying data access pattern and the energy consumption of the process. We determine hardware-related limiting factors, such as network bandwidth and cache pool availability and performance, and software aspects, e.g. workflow adjustment and parameter tuning, as the main data storage bottlenecks. By contrast, the challenge in providing the data from the archive for the users lies in retrieving the data from the tape archive and staging them. Building on this analysis, we suggest how to avoid/mitigate these problems in the future and define the requirements for future even more extensive long-term data archives.</description>

      <title>Spherinator and HiPSter: Representation Learning for Unbiased Knowledge Discovery from Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations are the best approximation to experimental laboratories in astrophysics and cosmology. However, the complexity, richness, and large size of their outputs severely limit the interpretability of their predictions. We describe a new, unbiased, and machine learning based approach to obtaining useful scientific insights from a broad range of simulations. The method can be used on today's largest simulations and will be essential to solve the extreme data exploration and analysis challenges posed by the Exascale era. Furthermore, this concept is so flexible, that it will also enable explorative access to observed data. Our concept is based on applying nonlinear dimensionality reduction to learn compact representations of the data in a low-dimensional space. The simulation data is projected onto this space for interactive inspection, visual interpretation, sample selection, and local analysis. We present a prototype using a rotational invariant hyperspherical variational convolutional autoencoder, utilizing a power distribution in the latent space, and trained on galaxies from IllustrisTNG simulation. Thereby, we obtain a natural Hubble tuning fork like similarity space that can be visualized interactively on the surface of a sphere by exploiting the power of HiPS tilings in Aladin Lite.</description>

      <title>UltraPINK -- New possibilities to explore Self-Organizing Kohonen Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms like self-organizing Kohonen maps are a promising approach to gain an overview among massive datasets. With UltraPINK, researchers can train, inspect, and explore self-organizing maps, whereby the toolbox of interaction possibilities grows continually. Key feature of UltraPINK is the consideration of versality in astronomical data. By keeping the operations as abstract as possible and using design patterns meant for abstract usage, we ensure that data is compatible with UltraPINK, regardless of its type, formatting, or origin. Future work on the application will keep extending the catalogue of exploration tools and the interfaces towards other established applications to process astronomical data. Ultimatively, we aim towards a solid infrastructure for data analysis in astronomy.</description>

      <title>PyExoCross: a Python program for generating spectra and cross-sections from molecular line lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PyExoCross is a Python adaptation of the ExoCross Fortran application, PyExoCross is designed for postprocessing the huge molecular line lists generated by the ExoMol project and other similar initiatives such as the HITRAN and HITEMP databases. PyExoCross generates absorption and emission stick spectra, cross-sections, and other properties (partition functions, specific heats, cooling functions, lifetimes, and oscillator strengths) based on molecular line lists. PyExoCross calculates cross-sections with four line profiles: Doppler, Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt profiles in both sampling and binned methods; a number of options are available for computing Voigt profiles which we test for speed and accuracy. PyExoCross supports importing and exporting line lists in the ExoMol and HITRAN/HITEMP formats. PyExoCross also provides conversion between the ExoMol and HITRAN data formats. In addition, PyExoCross has extra code for users to automate the batch download of line list files from the ExoMol database.</description>

      <title>High contrast at short separation with VLTI/GRAVITY: Bringing Gaia companions to light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2019, GRAVITY has provided direct observations of giant planets and brown dwarfs at separations of down to 95 mas from the host star. Some of these observations have provided the first direct confirmation of companions previously detected by indirect techniques (astrometry and radial velocities). We want to improve the observing strategy and data reduction in order to lower the inner working angle of GRAVITY in dual-field on-axis mode. We also want to determine the current limitations of the instrument when observing faint companions with separations in the 30-150 mas range. To improve the inner working angle, we propose a fiber off-pointing strategy during the observations to maximize the ratio of companion-light-to-star-light coupling in the science fiber. We also tested a lower-order model for speckles to decouple the companion light from the star light. We then evaluated the detection limits of GRAVITY using planet injection and retrieval in representative archival data. We compare our results to theoretical expectations. We validate our observing and data-reduction strategy with on-sky observations; first in the context of brown dwarf follow-up on the auxiliary telescopes with HD 984 B, and second with the first confirmation of a substellar candidate around the star Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464. With synthetic companion injection, we demonstrate that the instrument can detect companions down to a contrast of $8\times 10^{-4}$ ($\Delta \mathrm{K}= 7.7$ mag) at a separation of 35 mas, and a contrast of $3\times 10^{-5}$ ($\Delta \mathrm{K}= 11$ mag) at 100 mas from a bright primary (K&lt;6.5), for 30 min exposure time. With its inner working angle and astrometric precision, GRAVITY has a unique reach in direct observation parameter space. This study demonstrates the promising synergies between GRAVITY and Gaia for the confirmation and characterization of substellar companions.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Response for MeV $\mathrm{\gamma}$ Rays Observed with Balloon-Borne Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atmospheric response for MeV $\gamma$ rays ($\sim$ 0.1 $-$ 10 MeV) can be characterized in terms of two observed components. The first component is due to photons that reach the detector without scattering. The second component is due to photons that reach the detector after scattering one or more times. While the former can be determined in a straightforward manner, the latter is much more complex to quantify, as it requires tracking the transport of all source photons that are incident on Earth's atmosphere. The scattered component can cause a significant energy-dependent distortion in the measured spectrum, which is important to account for when making balloon-borne observations. In this work we simulate the full response for $\gamma$-ray transport in the atmosphere. We find that the scattered component becomes increasingly more significant towards lower energies, and at 0.1 MeV it may increase the measured flux by as much as a factor of $\sim2-4$, depending on the photon index and off-axis angle of the source. This is particularly important for diffuse sources, whereas the effect from scattering can be significantly reduced for point sources observed with an imaging telescope.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard method used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

      <title>An adaptive parameter estimator for poor-quality spectral data of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs represent the end stage for 97% of stars, making precise parameter measurement crucial for understanding stellar evolution. Traditional estimation methods involve fitting spectra or photometry, which require high-quality data. In recent years, machine learning has played a crucial role in processing spectral data due to its speed, automation, and accuracy. However, two common issues have been identified. First, most studies rely on data with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR &gt; 10), leaving many poor-quality datasets underutilized. Second, existing machine learning models, primarily based on convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and their variants, cannot simultaneously capture both the spatial and sequential information of spectra. To address these challenges, we designed the Estimator Network (EstNet), an advanced algorithm integrating multiple techniques, including Residual Networks, Squeeze and Excitation Attention, Gated Recurrent Units, Adaptive Loss, and Monte-Carlo Dropout Layers. We conducted parameter estimation on 5,965 poor-quality white dwarf spectra (R~1800, SNR~1.17), achieving average percentage errors of 14.86% for effective temperature and 3.97% for surface gravity. These results are significantly superior to other mainstream algorithms and consistent with the outcomes of traditional theoretical spectrum fitting methods. In the future, our algorithms will be applied for large-scale parameter estimation on the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.</description>

      <title>In-Depth Modeling of Tilt-To-Length Coupling in LISA's Interferometers and TDI Michelson Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present first-order models for tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in LISA, both for the individual interferometers as well as in the time-delay interferometry (TDI) Michelson observables. These models include the noise contributions from angular and lateral jitter coupling of the six test masses, six movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and three spacecraft. We briefly discuss which terms are considered to be dominant and reduce the TTL model for the second-generation TDI Michelson X observable to these primary noise contributions to estimate the resulting noise level. We show that the expected TTL noise will initially violate the entire mission displacement noise budget, resulting in the known necessity to fit and subtract TTL noise in data post-processing. By comparing the noise levels for different assumptions prior to subtraction, we show why noise mitigation by realignment prior to subtraction is favorable. We then discuss that the TTL coupling in the individual interferometers will have noise contributions that will not be present in the TDI observables. Models for TTL coupling noise in TDI and in the individual interferometers are therefore different, and commonly made assumptions are valid as such only for TDI but not for the individual interferometers. Finally, we analyze what implications can be drawn from the presented models for the subsequent fit-and-subtraction in post-processing. We show that noise contributions from the test mass and inter-satellite interferometers are indistinguishable, such that only the combined coefficients can be fit and used for subtraction. However, a distinction is considered not necessary. Additionally, we show a correlation between coefficients for transmitter and receiver jitter couplings in each individual TDI Michelson observable. This full correlation can be resolved by using all three Michelson observables for fitting the TTL coefficients.</description>

      <title>Swarm-intelligent search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03736v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement an eccentric search for compact binary mergers based on particle swarm optimization. Orbital eccentricity is an invaluable input for understanding the formation scenarios of the binary mergers and can play a pivotal role in finding their electromagnetic counterparts. Current modelled searches rely on pre-computed template banks that are computationally expensive and resistant towards expanding the search parameter space dimensionality. On the other hand, particle swarm optimization offers a straightforward algorithm that dynamically selects template points while exploring an arbitrary dimensional parameter space. Through extensive evaluation using simulated signals from spin-aligned eccentric binary mergers, we discovered that the search exhibits a remarkable autonomy in capturing the effects of both eccentricity and spin. We describe our search pipeline and revisit some of the merger candidates from the gravitational wave transient catalogs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the directly imaged HD 1160 system through spectroscopic characterization and high-cadence variability monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time variability and spectra of directly imaged companions provide insight into their physical properties and atmospheric dynamics. We present follow-up R~40 spectrophotometric monitoring of red companion HD 1160 B at 2.8-4.2 $\mu$m using the double-grating 360{\deg} vector Apodizing Phase Plate (dgvAPP360) coronagraph and ALES integral field spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. We use the recently developed technique of gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry to produce differential light curves for HD 1160 B. We reproduce the previously reported ~3.2 h periodic variability in archival data, but detect no periodic variability in new observations taken the following night with a similar 3.5% level precision, suggesting rapid evolution in the variability of HD 1160 B. We also extract complementary spectra of HD 1160 B for each night. The two are mostly consistent, but the companion appears fainter on the second night between 3.0-3.2 $\mu$m. Fitting models to these spectra produces different values for physical properties depending on the night considered. We find an effective temperature T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2794$^{+115}_{-133}$ K on the first night, consistent with the literature, but a cooler T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2279$^{+79}_{-157}$ K on the next. We estimate the mass of HD 1160 B to be 16-81 M$_{\text{Jup}}$, depending on its age. We also present R = 50,000 high-resolution optical spectroscopy of host star HD 1160 A obtained simultaneously with the PEPSI spectrograph. We reclassify its spectral type to A1 IV-V and measure its projected rotational velocity v sin i = 96$^{+6}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus highlight that gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry can achieve repeatable few percent level precision and does not yet reach a systematic noise floor, suggesting greater precision is achievable with additional data or advanced detrending techniques.</description>
