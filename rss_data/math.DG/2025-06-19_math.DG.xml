      <title>Shi-type and Hamilton-type gradient estimates for a general parabolic equation under compact Finsler $CD(-K,N)$ geometric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Li-Yau-type gradient estimates for positive solutions to parabolic equations
  \begin{equation}
  \partial_t u=\Delta u+\mathcal{R}_1u+\mathcal{R}_2u^{\alpha}+\mathcal{R}_3u(\log u)^{\beta},\notag
  \end{equation}
  under the general compact Finsler $CD(-K,N)$ geometric flow are studied. Here $\mathcal{R}_1$,$\mathcal{R}_2$,$\mathcal{R}_3$ $\in$ $ C^{1}(M,[0,T])$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both positive constants, $T$ is the maximal existence time for the flow. 
  However, compared with the Riemannian case, the curvature conditions impose stricter derivative bounds on the development term in the geometric flow, as well as on the derivative bounds of the distortion of the manifold. In this manuscript, we present Shi-type and Hamilton-type gradient estimates to demonstrate the possibility of removing such conditions.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Characterization of Compact Affine Manifolds with Parallel Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that any affine manifold $(M,\nabla)$ endowed with a parallel volume form $\omega,$ admits, in any conformal class of Riemannian metrics, a representative $H$ for which $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection. This provides a constructive proof that such manifolds are necessarily complete, generalizing the "if" direction of Markus' conjecture \cite{markus1962}. Moreover, our result demonstrates that these structures are intrinsically Riemannian-flat, a stronger conclusion than the affine completeness asserted by Markus. The metric $H$ arises naturally from the Hessian of volume-normalized distance functions and is shown to be globally smooth and $\nabla$-parallel, extending results of \cite{goldman1982} and \cite{benzecri1955} to higher dimensions with additional geometric structure. The construction proceeds through three technically novel steps: (1) local parallel metric normalization using the given volume form, (2) explicit Hessian calculations in adapted coordinates, and (3) gluing via affine transition maps that preserve the volumetric geometry. This approach reveals an unexpected rigidity in flat affine manifolds with compatible volume that goes beyond the topological constraints studied in \cite{fried1980}.</description>

      <title>Special vector fields on Riemannian manifolds of constant negative sectional curvature and conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant negative sectional curvature admits local orthonormal vector fields such that one of them $v_1$ is tangent to geodesics and the other $n-1$ vector fields are tangent to horocycles. We prove that the $1$-form dual to $v_1$ is a closed form. We show how the closed form can be used to obtain conservation laws for PDEs whose generic solutions define metrics on open subsets with constant negative sectional curvature. These results extend to higher dimensions the $2$-dimensional case proved in the 1980s. We prove that there exist local coordinates on the manifold such that the coordinate curves are tangent to the orthonormal vector fields. We apply the theory to obtain conservation laws for the Camassa-Holm equation ($n=2$) and for the Intrinsic Generalized Sine-Gordon equation ($n\geq 2$).</description>

      <title>On the Parallels Between Minimal Surfaces and Einstein Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces and Einstein manifolds are among the most natural structures in differential geometry. Whilst minimal surfaces are well understood, Einstein manifolds remain far less so. This exposition synthesises together a set of parallels between minimal surfaces embedded in an ambient three-manifold, and Einstein four-manifolds. These parallels include variational formulations, topological constraints, monotonicity formulae, compactness and epsilon-regularity theorems, and decompositions such as thick/thin and sheeted/non-sheeted structures.
  Though distinct in nature, the striking analogies between them raises a profound question: might there exist circumstances in which these objects are, in essence, manifestations of the same underlying geometry? Drawing on foundational results such as Jensen's theorem, Takahashi's theorem, and a conjecture of Song, this work suggests a bridge between the two structures. In particular, it shows that certain Einstein four-manifolds admit a minimal immersion into a higher-dimensional sphere. A key example of this is the embedding of $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ into $S^{7}$ via the Veronese map, where it arises as a minimal submanifold.</description>

      <title>On H-Conformal Semi-invariant Submersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore h-conformal semi-invariant submersions and almost h-conformal semi-invariant submersions originating from quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds to Riemannian manifolds. Our investigation focuses on the geometric characteristics of these submersions, including the integrability of distributions and the geometry of foliations. Additionally, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for such submersions to be totally geodesic. We also examine the equivalent conditions for the total manifold of the submersion to be twisted product manifold. Finally, we present a series of examples illustrating quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds and h-conformal semi-invariant submersions from quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds to Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>On balanced Hermitian threefolds with parallel Bismut torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study on Hermitian manifolds that are {\em Bismut torsion parallel,} or {\em BTP} for brevity, which means that the Bismut connection has parallel torsion tensor. For $n\geq 3$, BTP metrics can be balanced (and non-K\"ahler). In this paper, we give a classification of all compact, balanced BTP threefolds.</description>

      <title>Garding cones and positivity of curvature operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the relationship between Garding cones, demonstrating that the shift cone $\overline{\Gamma}^{+}_{2}(\alpha)$ is contained in $\overline{\mathcal{P}}_{m}$. By combining these results with the study of positivity properties of curvature operators, we establish several new connections between algebraic positivity conditions and the geometry of underlying Riemannian manifolds. Our main theorems reveal how shifted cone conditions on curvature operators-both standard and of the second kind-constrain topology, including vanishing theorems for Betti numbers and characterizations of spherical space forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the study of $G_2$-structures with special torsion, and isolated singularities. Many of the known examples with conical singularities admit additional symmetries, and we describe circle-invariant $G_2$-structures in this context. Finally, we show that collapsing the circle fibres of a contact Calabi-Yau manifold at isolated points cannot produce a $G_2$-structure with bounded torsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the openness of the balanced HKT cone within the cone of HKT structures on a compact hypercomplex manifold $(M,I,J,K)$. We also study the Lie algebra of hyperholomorphic vector fields of type (1,0) with respect to $I$, with particular emphasis on the case when there exists a compatible balanced HKT metric. These fields exhibit a strict interplay with the balanced HKT structure, for instance, we prove a harmonicity property for (1,0)-forms dual to hyperholomorphic vector fields. We also show non-existence of hyperholomorphic (1,0)-vector fields on some hypercomplex manifolds admitting a HKT--Einstein metric.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to a kind of rearrangement of functions on noncollapsed RCD(k,n)-spaces, which satisfy a Polya-Szego type inequality. This allows to prove functional inequalities on a wide class of manifolds, that we describe. As a consequence, we give a characterization, among manifolds with lower bounded Ricci curvature, of those admitting a Moser-Trudinger type inequality</description>

      <title>Blowups of Dirac structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a real, twisted Dirac structure $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, and a closed embedded submanifold $N\subseteq M$ of codimension $&gt;1$, we characterise when $L$ lifts to a smooth, twisted Dirac structure on the real projective blowup of $M$ along $N$. This holds precisely when $N$ is either a submanifold transverse to $L$ (with no further restrictions) or a submanifold invariant for $L$, for which the Lie algebras transverse to $N$ have all of the same constant height $k\geq 0$. We also classify Lie algebras satisfying this Lie-theoretic property. We recover a theorem of Polishchuk, which establishes that a Poisson structure lifts to a Poisson structure on the blowup of a submanifold exactly when the submanifold is invariant and the transverse Lie algebras have constant height $k=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenges posed by the development of field theories, both classical and quantum, force us to question their most basic and foundational ideas like the role and origin of space-time, the meaning of physical states, etc. Among them the notion of ``field'' itself is notoriously difficult to address. These notes aim to analyze such notion from the perspective offered by the groupoid description of quantum mechanics inspired by Schwinger's picture of quantum mechanics. Then, a natural interpretation of the notion of physical fields as functors among appropriate groupoids will emerge. The domain of a field in this new picture is a groupoid that describes ``test particles'', and its codomain is a groupoid that describes the intrinsic nature of the system being probed. Such a space of functors carries some natural structures, which are best described in a categorical language. Some illustrative examples will be presented that could help clarify the various abstract notions discussed in the text.</description>

      <title>Segre forms of singular metrics on vector bundles and Lelong numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E\to X$ be a holomorphic vector bundle with a singular Griffiths negative Hermitian metric $h$ with analytic singularities. One can define, given a smooth reference metric $h_0$, a current $s(E,h,h_0)$ that is called the associated Segre form, which defines the expected Bott-Chern class and coincides with the usual Segre form of $h$ where it is smooth. We prove that $s(E,h,h_0)$ is the limit of the Segre forms of a sequence of smooth metrics if the metric is smooth outside the unbounded locus, and in general as a limit of Segre forms of metrics with empty unbounded locus. One can also define an associated Chern form $c(E,h,h_0)$ and we prove that the Lelong numbers of $s(E,h,h_0)$ and $c(E,h,h_0)$ are integers if the singularities are integral, and non-negative for $s(E,h,h_0)$. We also extend these results to a slightly larger class of singular metrics with analytic singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This exposition presents recent developments on proper actions,
  highlighting their connections to representation theory. It begins with geometric aspects,
  including criteria for the properness of homogeneous spaces in the setting of reductive groups. We then explore the interplay between the properness of group actions and the discrete decomposability of unitary representations realized on function spaces. Furthermore, two contrasting new approaches to quantifying proper actions are examined:
  one based on the notion of sharpness, which measures how strongly a given action satisfies properness;
  and another based on dynamical volume estimates,
  which measure deviations from properness. The latter quantitative estimates have proven especially fruitful in establishing temperedness criterion for regular unitary representations on $G$-spaces. Throughout,
  key concepts are illustrated with concrete geometric and representation-theoretic examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flag curvature is a natural Finsler extension of the sectional curvature in Riemannian geometry. However, there are many non-Riemannian quantities which interact with the flag curvature. In this paper, we introduce a notion of weighted flag curvature by modifying the flag curvature using the non-Riemannian quantity, $T$-curvature. We show that a forward complete open Finsler manifold with positive weighted flag curvature is necessarily diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space, and that a compact Finsler manifold with nonnegative weighted flag curvature and strictly convex boundary is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean ball.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate two distinct classes of normal geodesic flows associated with the left-invariant sub-Riemannian metric on the (2n + 1)-dimensional Heisenberg group. The first class arises from the left-invariant distribution, whereas the second is derived from the right-invariant distribution. It is established that the Hamiltonian system corresponding to the left-left (LL) configuration is completely integrable in the non-commutative sense. We demonstrate that the left-right (LR) systems exhibit non-commutative integrability in dimensions exceeding 5, while in dimensions 3 and 5, integrability is achieved in the commutative sense.</description>

      <title>Coarse pseudo-differential calculus and index theory on manifolds with a tangent Lie structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified (coarse) version of pseudo-differential calculus for operators of order zero on complete Riemannian manifolds. This calculus works for the usual Hormander (1,0) class of operators, as well as for pseudo-differential operators on filtered manifolds. In fact, we develop the coarse PDO calculus on a more general class of manifolds which we call manifolds with a tangent Lie structure. We prove an index theorem for `h-elliptic' operators where the index is not just an integer, but an element of the K-homology group of the manifold.</description>

Abstract: For a Lie groupoid $G$, the differential forms on its nerve comprise a double complex. A natural question is if this statement extends to forms with values in a representation $V$ of $G$. In this paper, we research two types of covariant derivatives which commute with the simplicial differential, yielding two types of "curved" double complexes of forms with coefficients in $V$. The naive approach is to consider a linear connection $\nabla$ on $V$, in which case $d^\nabla$ commutes with the simplicial differential if and only if $\nabla$ satisfies a certain (restrictive) invariance condition. The heart of this paper focuses on another, more compelling approach: using a multiplicative Ehresmann connection for a bundle of ideals. In this case, we obtain a geometrically richer curved double complex, where the cochain map is given by the horizontal exterior covariant derivative $D$, which generalizes the well-known operator from the theory of principal bundles. Moreover, both differential operators $d^\nabla$ and $D$ are researched in the infinitesimal setting of Lie algebroids, as well as their relationship with the van Est map. We conclude by using the operator $D$ to study the curvature of an (infinitesimal) multiplicative Ehresmann connection.</description>

      <title>Abstract cone operators and Lipschitz rigidity for scalar curvature on singular manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the index theory for twisted Dirac operators acting on sections of Lipschitz bundles over non-compact manifolds, we prove Llarull-type comparison results in scalar curvature geometry. They apply to spin Riemannian manifolds with cone-type singularities and Lipschitz comparison maps to spheres.
  We use the language of abstract cone operators which are introduced and studied in a general functional analytic setting and which may be of independent interest.
  Applying our discussion to spherical suspensions of odd-dimensional closed manifolds, we generalize a Lipschitz rigidity result of the first three named authors from even to odd dimensions. Under stronger conditions, this has already been shown by Lee-Tam using geometric flows and by Baer using an upper estimate for the smallest Dirac eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Singular cscK metrics on smoothable varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the lower semi-continuity of the coercivity threshold of Mabuchi functional along a degenerate family of normal compact K\"ahler varieties with klt singularities. Moreover, we establish the existence of singular cscK metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothable klt varieties when the Mabuchi functional is coercive, these arise as a limit of cscK metrics on close-by fibres. The proof relies on developing a novel strong topology of pluripotential theory in families and establishing uniform estimates for cscK metrics.</description>
