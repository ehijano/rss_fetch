      <title>Evaluation and statistical correction of area-based heat index forecasts that drive a heatwave warning service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of the area-based, district heatwave forecasts that drive the Australian heatwave warning service. The analysis involves using a recently developed approach of scoring multicategorical forecasts using the FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) scoring framework. Additionally, we quantify the stability of the district forecasts between forecast updates. Notably, at longer lead times, a discernible overforecast bias exists that leads to issuing severe and extreme heatwave district forecasts too frequently. Consequently, at shorter lead times forecast heatwave categories are frequently downgraded with subsequent revisions. To address these issues, we demonstrate how isotonic regression can be used to conditionally bias correct the district forecasts. Finally, using synthetic experiments, we illustrate that even if an area warning is derived from a perfectly calibrated gridded forecast, the area warning will be biased in most situations. We show how these biases can also be corrected using isotonic regression which could lead to a better heatwave warning service. Importantly, the evaluation and bias correction approaches demonstrated in this paper are relevant to forecast parameters other than heat indices.</description>

      <title>Reconciling risk-based and storyline attribution with Bayes theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question to what extent climate change is responsible for extreme weather events has been at the forefront of public and scholarly discussion for years. Proponents of the "risk-based" approach to attribution attempt to give an unconditional answer based on the probability of some class of events in a world with and without human influences. As an alternative, so-called "storyline" studies investigate the impact of a warmer world on a single, specific weather event. This can be seen as a conditional attribution statement. In this study, we connect conditional to unconditional attribution using Bayes theorem: in essence, the conditional statement is composed of two unconditional statements, one based on all available data (event and conditions) and one based on the conditions alone. We explore the effects of the conditioning in a simple statistical toy model and a real-world attribution of European summer temperatures conditional on blocking. The resulting attribution statement is generally strengthened if the conditions are not affected by climate change. Conversely, if part of the trend is contained in the conditions, a weaker attribution statement may result.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Scaling from Deep Learning Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06112v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spatial and temporal structures are inherent characteristics of turbulent fluid flows and comprehending them poses a major challenge. This comprehesion necessitates an understanding of the space of turbulent fluid flow configurations. We employ a diffusion-based generative model to learn the distribution of turbulent vorticity profiles and generate snapshots of turbulent solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We consider the inverse cascade in two spatial dimensions and generate diverse turbulent solutions that differ from those in the training dataset. We analyze the statistical scaling properties of the new turbulent profiles, calculate their structure functions, energy power spectrum, velocity probability distribution function and moments of local energy dissipation. All the learnt scaling exponents are consistent with the expected Kolmogorov scaling. This agreement with established turbulence characteristics provides strong evidence of the model's capability to capture essential features of real-world turbulence.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Attributing Change in Climate and Complex Systems: Foundations, Green's Functions, and Nonlinear Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection and attribution (D&amp;A) studies are cornerstones of climate science, providing crucial evidence for policy decisions. Their goal is to link observed climate change patterns to anthropogenic and natural drivers via the optimal fingerprinting method (OFM). We show that response theory for nonequilibrium systems offers the physical and dynamical basis for OFM, including the concept of causality used for attribution. Our framework clarifies the method's assumptions, advantages, and potential weaknesses. We use our theory to perform D&amp;A for prototypical climate change experiments performed on an energy balance model and on a low-resolution coupled climate model. We also explain the underpinnings of degenerate fingerprinting, which offers early warning indicators for tipping points. Finally, we extend the OFM to the nonlinear response regime. Our analysis shows that OFM has broad applicability across diverse stochastic systems influenced by time-dependent forcings, with potential relevance to ecosystems, quantitative social sciences, and finance, among others.</description>

      <title>Statistical Response of ENSO Complexity to Initial Condition and Model Parameter Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the response of a climate system to perturbations has practical significance. Standard methods in computing the trajectory-wise deviation caused by perturbations may suffer from the chaotic nature that makes the model error dominate the true response after a short lead time. Statistical response, which computes the return described by the statistics, provides a systematic way of reaching robust outcomes with an appropriate quantification of the uncertainty and extreme events. In this paper, information theory is applied to compute the statistical response and find the most sensitive perturbation direction of different El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events to initial value and model parameter perturbations. Depending on the initial phase and the time horizon, different state variables contribute to the most sensitive perturbation direction. While initial perturbations in sea surface temperature (SST) and thermocline depth usually lead to the most significant response of SST at short- and long-range, respectively, initial adjustment of the zonal advection can be crucial to trigger strong statistical responses at medium-range around 5 to 7 months, especially at the transient phases between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. It is also shown that the response in the variance triggered by external random forcing perturbations, such as the wind bursts, often dominates the mean response, making the resulting most sensitive direction very different from the trajectory-wise methods. Finally, despite the strong non-Gaussian climatology distributions, using Gaussian approximations in the information theory is efficient and accurate for computing the statistical response, allowing the method to be applied to sophisticated operational systems.</description>

      <title>Aardvark weather: end-to-end data-driven weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is critical for a range of human activities including transportation, agriculture, industry, as well as the safety of the general public. Machine learning models have the potential to transform the complex weather prediction pipeline, but current approaches still rely on numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, limiting forecast speed and accuracy. Here we demonstrate that a machine learning model can replace the entire operational NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests raw observations and outputs global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. Further, it can be optimised end-to-end to maximise performance over quantities of interest. Global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for multiple variables and lead times. Local station forecasts are skillful up to ten days lead time and achieve comparable and often lower errors than a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. These forecasts are produced with a remarkably simple neural process model using just 8% of the input data and three orders of magnitude less compute than existing NWP and hybrid AI-NWP methods. We anticipate that Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end machine learning models for medium-range forecasting that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude and enable the rapid and cheap creation of bespoke models for users in a variety of fields, including for the developing world where state-of-the-art local models are not currently available.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Emulating Ocean Climate Variability across $CO_2$ forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the success of machine learning (ML) applied to climate reaching further every day, emulators have begun to show promise not only for weather but for multi-year time scales in the atmosphere. Similar work for the ocean remains nascent, with state-of-the-art limited to models running for shorter time scales or only for regions of the globe. In this work, we demonstrate high-skill global emulation for surface ocean fields over 5-8 years of model rollout, accurately representing modes of variability for two different ML architectures (ConvNext and Transformers). In addition, we address the outstanding question of generalization, an essential consideration if the end-use of emulation is to model warming scenarios outside of the model training data. We show that 1) generalization is not an intrinsic feature of a data-driven emulator, 2) fine-tuning the emulator on only small amounts of additional data from a distribution similar to the test set can enable the emulator to perform well in a warmed climate, and 3) the forced emulators are robust to noise in the forcing.</description>

      <title>Large-scale semi-organized rolls in a sheared convective turbulence: Mean-field simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a mean-field theory of a non-rotating turbulent convection (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 66}, 066305, 2002), we perform mean-field simulations (MFS) of sheared convection which takes into account an effect of modification of the turbulent heat flux by the non-uniform large-scale motions. As the result of this effect, there is an excitation of large-scale convective-shear instability, which causes the formation of large-scale semi-organized structures in the form of rolls. The life-times and spatial scales of these structures are much larger compared to the turbulent scales. By means of MFS performed for stress-free and no-slip vertical boundary conditions, we determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of these structures. Our study demonstrates that the modification of the turbulent heat flux by non-uniform flows leads to a strong reduction of the critical effective Rayleigh number (based on the eddy viscosity and turbulent temperature diffusivity) required for the formation of the large-scale rolls. During the nonlinear stage of the convective-shear instability, there is a transition from the two-layer vertical structure with two roles in the vertical direction before the system reaches steady-state to the one-layer vertical structure with one role after the system reaches steady-state. This effect is observed for all effective Rayleigh numbers. We find that inside the convective rolls, the spatial distribution of the mean potential temperature includes regions with a positive vertical gradient of the potential temperature caused by the mean heat flux of the convective rolls. This study might be useful for understanding of the origin of large-scale rolls observed in atmospheric convective boundary layers as well as in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments.</description>
