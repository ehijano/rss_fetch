      <title>Research on Credit Risk Early Warning Model of Commercial Banks Based on Neural Network Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of globalized financial markets, commercial banks are confronted with an escalating magnitude of credit risk, thereby imposing heightened requisites upon the security of bank assets and financial stability. This study harnesses advanced neural network techniques, notably the Backpropagation (BP) neural network, to pioneer a novel model for preempting credit risk in commercial banks. The discourse initially scrutinizes conventional financial risk preemptive models, such as ARMA, ARCH, and Logistic regression models, critically analyzing their real-world applications. Subsequently, the exposition elaborates on the construction process of the BP neural network model, encompassing network architecture design, activation function selection, parameter initialization, and objective function construction. Through comparative analysis, the superiority of neural network models in preempting credit risk in commercial banks is elucidated. The experimental segment selects specific bank data, validating the model's predictive accuracy and practicality. Research findings evince that this model efficaciously enhances the foresight and precision of credit risk management.</description>

      <title>Is the annualized compounded return of Medallion over 35%?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a challenge to estimate fund performance by compounded returns. Arguably, it is incorrect to use yearly returns directly for compounding, with reported annualized return of above 60% for Medallion for the 31 years up to 2018. We propose an estimation based on fund sizes and trading profits and obtain a compounded return of 32.6% before fees with a 3% financing rate. Alternatively, we suggest using the manager's wealth as a proxy and arriving at a compounded growth rate of 25.6% for Simons for the 33 years up to 2020. We conclude that the annualized compounded return of Medallion before fees is probably under 35%. Our findings have implications for how to compute fund performance correctly.</description>

      <title>Data-generating process and time-series asset pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the data-generating processes for factors expressed in return differences, which the literature on time-series asset pricing seems to have overlooked. For the factors' data-generating processes or long-short zero-cost portfolios, a meaningful definition of returns is impossible; further, the compounded market factor (MF) significantly underestimates the return difference between the market and the risk-free rate compounded separately. Surprisingly, if MF were treated coercively as periodic-rebalancing long-short (i.e., the same as size and value), Fama-French three-factor (FF3) would be economically unattractive for lacking compounding and irrelevant for suffering from the small "size of an effect." Otherwise, FF3 might be misspecified if MF were buy-and-hold long-short. Finally, we show that OLS with net returns for single-index models leads to inflated alphas, exaggerated t-values, and overestimated Sharpe ratios (SR); worse, net returns may lead to pathological alphas and SRs. We propose defining factors (and SRs) with non-difference compound returns.</description>

      <title>The Black-Scholes-Merton dual equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.10380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the Black-Scholes-Merton dual equation, which has exactly the same form as the Black-Scholes-Merton equation. The novel and general equation works for options with a payoff of homogeneous of degree one, including European, American, Bermudan, Asian, barrier, lookback, etc., and leads to new insights into pricing and hedging. Perceptibly, a put-call equality emerges - all the put options can be priced as their corresponding calls by simultaneously swapping stock price (dividend yield) for strike price (risk-free rate), and vice versa. Equally important, we provide simple analytic formulas for hedging parameters delta and gamma, which elevate the put-call equality to true practical applicability. For futures options, the put-call equality leads to "symmetric" properties between puts and calls or among puts (calls).</description>
