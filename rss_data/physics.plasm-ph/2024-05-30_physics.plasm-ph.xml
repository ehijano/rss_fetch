      <title>Ponderomotive electron physics captured in single-fluid extended MHD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known ponderomotive force, arising from the interaction of matter and light, has critical implications across a broad range of fields from laser fusion and astrophysics to laser diagnostics and even pulsed-power experiments. This pseudo-potential pushes electrons, which through coulomb forces causes ion density modulations that can steepen with profound implications. When used intentionally, density modulations can be used for plasma gratings, which are essential for optical components operating in extreme conditions for next generation lasers. They can also be important for plasma confinement and particle trapping, which can even impact magnetic confinement in fusion devices. The ponderomotive potential also leads to laser self-focusing, complicating laser diagnostics. In laser fusion, the force exacerbates challenges posed by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and crossed beam energy transfer (CBET), both of which destabilize the fusion process. It even plays an astrophysical role in the filamentation of fast radio bursts in the relativistic winds of magnetars. Since the ponderomotive force primarily effects electron dynamics, multi-fluid/particle codes or additional ansatz are required to include its effects. This paper demonstrates that by including electron effects on an ion timescale with a 1-fluid, 2-energy extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) model, ponderomotive effects are also naturally present. We introduce the theory for these dynamics and demonstrate their presence with 1-D pencil-like simulations.</description>

      <title>On Magnetic Compression in Gyrokinetic Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of finite magnetic compressibility in low-beta magnetised plasmas is considered within the gyrokinetic description. The gauge transformation method of Littlejohn is used to obtain a Lagrangian which contains this effect additionally. The field theory version obtains a system model which guarantees exact energetic consistency. Gyrocenter drifts under this model are considered within a Chew-Goldberger-Low MHD equilibrium allowing for pressure anisotropy. The contributions to the current divergence balance, hence the dynamics, due to the difference between the curvature and grad-B drifts and to the compressibility are shown to cancel up to corrections of order beta. This recovers an earlier result with the same conclusion within linear theory of kinetic ballooning modes.</description>

      <title>The Kinetic Ion-Temperature-Gradient-driven instability and its localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a description of Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven localised modes which retains both wave-particle and magnetic drift resonant effects while capturing the field-line dependence of the electrostatic potential. We exploit the smallness of the magnetic drift and the strong localisation of the mode to resolve the problem with a polynomial-gaussian expansion in the field-following co-ordinate. A simple semi-analytical formula for the spectrum of the mode is shown to capture long wavelength Landau damping, ion-scale Larmor radius stabilization, weakening of Larmor radius effects at short-wavelengths and magnetic-drift resonant stabilisation. These elements lead to spectra with multiple maxima as observed in gyrokinetic simulations in stellarators. Connections to the transition to extended eigenfunctions and those localized by less unfavorable curvature regions (hopping solutions) are also made. The model provides a clear qualitative framework with which to interpret numerically simulated ITG mode spectra with realistic geometries, despite its limitations for exact quantitative predictions.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Particle Acceleration and Pitch-Angle Anisotropy Driven by Magnetic Reconnection: Ion-Electron Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle acceleration and pitch-angle anisotropy resulting from magnetic reconnection are investigated in highly magnetized ion-electron plasmas. By means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic reconnection generates anisotropic particle distributions $f_s \left( {|\cos \alpha|,\varepsilon} \right)$, characterized by broken power laws in the particle energy spectrum $f_s (\varepsilon) \propto \varepsilon^{-p}$ and pitch angle $\langle \sin^2 \alpha \rangle \propto \varepsilon^m$. Their characteristics are determined by the ratio of the guide field to the reconnecting field ($B_g/B_0$) and the plasma magnetization ($\sigma_0$). Below the break energy $\varepsilon_0$, ion and electron energy spectra are extremely hard ($p_&lt;\lesssim 1$) for any $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, while above $\varepsilon_0$, the spectral index steepens ($p_&gt; \gtrsim 2$), displaying high sensitivity to both $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0$. The pitch angle displays power-law ranges with negative slopes ($m_&lt;$) below and positive slopes ($m_&gt;$) above $\varepsilon_{\min \alpha}$, steepening with increasing $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0$. The ratio $B_g/B_0$ regulates the redistribution of magnetic energy between ions ($\Delta E_i$) and electrons ($\Delta E_e$), with $\Delta E_i \gg \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \ll 1$, $\Delta E_i \sim \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \sim 1$, and $\Delta E_i \ll \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \gg 1$, with $\Delta E_i/\Delta E_e$ approaching unity when $\sigma_0 \gg 1$. The anisotropic distribution of accelerated particles results in an optically thin synchrotron power spectrum $F_\nu(\nu) \propto\nu^{(2-2p+m)/(4+m)}$ and a linear polarization degree $\Pi_{\rm lin} = (p+1)/(p+7/3+m/3)$. Pitch-angle anisotropy also induces temperature anisotropy and eases synchrotron cooling, along with producing beamed radiation, potentially responsible for frequency-dependent variability.</description>

      <title>Dust dynamics in RAMSES -- II. Equilibrium drift velocity distributions of charged dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18463v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gas-grain relative drift velocity distributions of charged astrophysical dust grains in MHD turbulence. We do this using a range of MHD-PIC simulations spanning different plasma-$\beta$, sonic/Alfv\'en Mach number, and with grains of varying size and charge-to-mass ratio. We find that the root-mean-square drift velocity is a strong function of the grain size, following a power law with a 1/2 slope. The r.m.s. value has only a very weak dependence on the charge-to-mass ratio. On the other hand, the shape of the distribution is a strong function of the grain charge-to-mass ratio, and in compressible turbulence, also the grain size. We then compare these results to simple analytic models based upon time-domain quasi-linear theory and solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. These models explain qualitatively the r.m.s. drift velocity's lack of charge-to-mass ratio dependence, as well as why the shape of the distribution changes as the charge-to-mass ratio increases. Finally we scale our results to astrophysical conditions. As an example, at a length scale of one parsec in the cold neutral medium, 0.1 $\mu$m grains should be drifting at roughly 40% of the turbulent velocity dispersion. These findings may serve as a basis for a model for grain velocities in the context of grain-grain collisions, non-thermal sputtering, and accretion of metals. These findings also have implications for the transport of grains through the galaxy, suggesting that grains may have non-negligible random motions at length-scales that many modern galaxy simulations approach.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Linear Magnetic Holes with Magnetic Mirror Properties in Hybrid Simulations of Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic holes (MHs) are coherent magnetic field dips whose size ranges from fluid to kinetic scale, ubiquitously observed in the heliosphere and in planetary environments. Despite the longstanding effort in interpreting the abundance of observations, the origin and properties of MHs are still debated. In this letter, we investigate the interplay between plasma turbulence and MHs, using a 2D hybrid simulation initialized with solar wind parameters. We show that fully developed turbulence exhibits localized elongated magnetic depressions, whose properties are consistent with linear MHs frequently encountered in space. The observed MHs develop self-consistently from the initial magnetic field perturbations, by trapping hot ions with large pitch angles. Ion trapping produces an enhanced perpendicular temperature anysotropy that makes MHs stable for hundreds of ion gyroperiods, despite the surrounding turbulence. We introduce a new quantity, based on local magnetic field and ion temperature values, to measure the efficiency of ion trapping, with potential applications to the detection of MHs in satellite measurements. We complement this method by analyzing the ion velocity distribution functions inside MHs. Our diagnostics reveal the presence of trapped gyrotropic ion populations, whose velocity distribution is consistent with a loss cone, as expected for the motion of particles inside a magnetic mirror. Our results have potential implications for the theoretical and numerical modelling of MHs.</description>

Abstract: We show the laser-driven acceleration of unprecedented, collimated ($ 2 \ \mathrm{mrad} $ divergence), and quasi-monoenergetic ($ 25 \ \% $ energy spread) electron beams with energy up to $ 50 \ \mathrm{MeV} $ at $ 1 \ \mathrm{kHz} $ repetition rate. The laser driver is a multi-cycle ($ 15 \ \mathrm{fs} $) $ 1 \ \mathrm{kHz} $ optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) system, operating at $ 26 \ \mathrm{mJ} $ ($ 1.7 \ \mathrm{TW} $). The scalability of the driver laser technology and the electron beams reported in this work pave the way towards developing high-brilliance x-ray sources for medical imaging, innovative devices for brain cancer treatment, and represent a step towards the realization of a kHz GeV electron beamline.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic toroidal rotation driven by turbulent and neoclassical processes in tokamak plasmas from global gyrokinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gyrokinetic tokamak plasmas can exhibit intrinsic toroidal rotation driven by the residual stress. While most studies have attributed the residual stress to the parallel-momentum flux from the turbulent $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ motion, the parallel-momentum flux from the drift-orbit motion (denoted $\Pi_\parallel^D$) and the $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$-momentum flux from the $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ motion (denoted $\Pi_{E\times B}$) are often neglected. Here, we use the global total-$f$ gyrokinetic code XGC to study the residual stress in the core and the edge of a DIII-D H-mode plasma. Numerical results show that both $\Pi_\parallel^D$ and $\Pi_{E\times B}$ make up a significant portion of the residual stress. In particular, $\Pi_\parallel^D$ in the core is higher than the collisional neoclassical level in the presence of turbulence, while in the edge it represents an outflux of counter-current momentum even without turbulence. Using a recently developed ``orbit-flux'' formulation, we show that the higher-than-neoclassical-level $\Pi_\parallel^D$ in the core is driven by turbulence, while the outflux of counter-current momentum from the edge is mainly due to collisional ion orbit loss. These results suggest that $\Pi_\parallel^D$ and $\Pi_{E\times B}$ can be important for the study of intrinsic toroidal rotation.</description>

      <title>Novel Signatures of Radiation Reaction in Electron-Laser Sidescattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate novel signatures of radiation reaction via the angular deflection of an electron beam colliding at 90 degrees with an intense laser pulse. Due to the radiation reaction effect, the electrons can be deflected towards the beam axis for plane wave backgrounds, which is not possible in the absence of radiation reaction effects. The magnitude and size of the deflection angle can be controlled by tailoring the laser pulse shapes. The effect is first derived analytically using the Landau-Lifshitz equation, which allows to determine the important scaling behavior with laser intensity and particle energy. We then move on to full scale 3D Monte Carlo simulations to verify the effect is observable with present day laser technology. We investigate the opportunities for an indirect observation of laser depletion in such side scattering scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimised stellarators with a positive radial electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We draw attention to an interesting possibility in the design and operation of stellarator fusion reactors, which has hitherto been considered unrealistic under burning-plasma conditions. Thanks to recent advances in stellarator optimisation theory, it appears possible to create a positive (outward-pointing) radial electric field in the plasma core by carefully tailoring the geometry of the magnetic field. This electric field is likely to expel highly charged impurities from the centre of the plasma through neoclassical transport and thus eliminate, or at least mitigate, a long-standing problem in stellarator physics. Further out, the electric field is expected to suddenly change sign from positive to negative, thus creating a region of strongly sheared flow, which could locally suppress turbulent transport and enhance overall energy confinement.</description>
