      <title>Radiological and Biological Dictionary of Radiomics Features: Addressing Understandable AI Issues in Personalized Breast Cancer; Dictionary Version BM1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiomics-based AI models show promise for breast cancer diagnosis but often lack interpretability, limiting clinical adoption. This study addresses the gap between radiomic features (RF) and the standardized BI-RADS lexicon by proposing a dual-dictionary framework. First, a Clinically-Informed Feature Interpretation Dictionary (CIFID) was created by mapping 56 RFs to BI-RADS descriptors (shape, margin, internal enhancement) through literature and expert review. The framework was applied to classify triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) versus non-TNBC using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI from a multi-institutional cohort of 1,549 patients. We trained 27 machine learning classifiers with 27 feature selection methods. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interpret predictions and generate a complementary Data-Driven Feature Interpretation Dictionary (DDFID) for 52 additional RFs. The best model, combining Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) selection with Extra Trees Classifier, achieved an average cross-validation accuracy of 0.83. Key predictive RFs aligned with clinical knowledge: higher Sphericity (round/oval shape) and lower Busyness (more homogeneous enhancement) were associated with TNBC. The framework confirmed known imaging biomarkers and uncovered novel, interpretable associations. This dual-dictionary approach (BM1.0) enhances AI model transparency and supports the integration of RFs into routine breast cancer diagnosis and personalized care.</description>

      <title>Iterative Born Solver for the Acoustic Helmholtz Equation with Heterogeneous Sound Speed and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient numerical solution of the acoustic Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media remains challenging, particularly for large-scale problems with spatially-varying density - a limitation that restricts applications in biomedical acoustics and seismic imaging. We present a fast iterative solver that extends the Convergent Born Series method to handle arbitrary variations in sound speed, density, and absorption simultaneously. Our approach reformulates the Helmholtz equation as a first-order system and applies Vettenburg and Vellekoop's universal split-preconditioner, yielding a matrix-free algorithm that leverages Fast Fourier Transforms for computational efficiency. Unlike existing Born series methods, our solver accommodates heterogeneous density without requiring expensive matrix decompositions or pre-processing steps, making it suitable for large-scale 3D problems with minimal memory overhead. The method provides both forward and adjoint solutions, enabling its application for inverse problems. We validate accuracy through comparison against an analytical solution and demonstrate the solver's practical utility through transcranial ultrasound simulations. The solver achieves convergence for strong scattering scenarios, offering a computationally efficient alternative to time-domain methods and matrix-based Helmholtz solvers for applications ranging from medical ultrasound treatment planning to seismic exploration.</description>

      <title>High-$T_{\rm c}$ Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC superconductors accessible via topochemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hole-doping of covalent materials has long served as a blueprint for designing conventional high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, but thermodynamic constraints severely limit the space of realizable compounds. Our {\it ab initio} results indicate that metastable Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC phases can be accessed via standard topochemical ion exchange reactions starting from Li$_x$BC precursors. Unlike all known stoichiometric layered metal borocarbides, the predicted AgBC and CuBC derivatives, comprising honeycomb layers bridged by dumbbells, are metallic rather than semiconducting. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals that the intrinsically hole-doped AgBC possesses a unique combination of electronic and vibrational features to exhibit two-gap superconductivity above 50 K.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Alpha-Particle-Immune Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA-FET) Based SRAM Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using 3D Technology Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD) simulations, we show that it is possible to design a static random-access memory (SRAM) using gate-all-around field-effect-transistor (GAA-FET) technology so that it is immune to single alpha particle radiation error. In other words, with the design, there will be no single-event upset (SEU) due to alpha particles. We first use ab initio calculations in PHITS to show that there is a maximum linear energy transfer (LET), LETmax, for the alpha particle in Si and Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$. Based on that, by designing a sub-7nm GAA-FET-based SRAM with bottom dielectric isolation (BDI), we show that the SRAM does not flip even if the particle strike is in the worst-case scenario (LET &gt; LETmax).</description>

      <title>An AI super-resolution field emulator for cosmological hydrodynamics: the Lyman-{\alpha} forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our super-resolution and emulation framework for cosmological dark matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions (HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with \texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power spectrum (\(k &lt; 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km}\)), and less than 10\% error in the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets for next-generation cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations in a polar fluid: confronting stochastic density functional theory to simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic behavior of polar fluids is essential for modeling complex systems such as electrolytes and biological media. In this work, we develop and apply a Stochastic Density Functional Theory (SDFT) framework to describe the polarization dynamics in the Stockmayer fluid, a prototypical model of dipolar liquids consisting of Lennard-Jones particles with embedded point dipoles. Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory's validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Neural Network for Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been proposed for solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs), but most of them heavily rely on data and suffer from limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, a new solving scheme is proposed where the solution is iteratively updated following the updating of the physics-driven neural network (PDNN), the hyperparameters of which are optimized by minimizing the loss function which incorporates the constraints from the collected scattered fields and the prior information about scatterers. Unlike data-driven neural network solvers, PDNN is trained only requiring the input of collected scattered fields and the computation of scattered fields corresponding to predicted solutions, thus avoids the generalization problem. Moreover, to accelerate the imaging efficiency, the subregion enclosing the scatterers is identified. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high reconstruction accuracy and strong stability, even when dealing with composite lossy scatterers.</description>

      <title>A general model for frictional contacts in colloidal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In simulations of colloidal matter, frictional contacts between particles are often neglected. For spherical colloids, such an approximation can be problematic, since frictional contacts couple translational and rotational degrees of freedom, which may affect the collective behavior of, e.g., colloids under shear and chiral active matter. Deterministic models for frictional contacts have been proposed in the granular matter community. On the colloidal scale, however, thermal fluctuations are important and should be included in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Here, we derive the correct fluctuation-dissipation relation for linear and nonlinear instantaneous frictional contact interactions. Among other, this generates a new generalized class of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermostats with rotation-translation coupling. We demonstrate effects of frictional contact interactions using the examples of Poiseuille flow and motility induced phase separation in active Langevin particles.</description>

      <title>Modelling gyrosynchrotron emission from coronal energetic electrons in a CME flux rope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can accelerate electrons, causing bursts such as type IV emissions in the solar radio continuum. Although radio spectroscopy is a powerful diagnostic tool for the corona, the origin and mechanisms of type IV bursts remain uncertain. In situ measurements can occasionally shed some light on these mechanisms, but they are limited in space and time. Sophisticated numerical modelling offers the best approach to improve our understanding of the physical processes involved. This research examines type IV radio bursts, exploring the effects of various electron distribution properties and CMEs on their generation and characteristics. To transcend idealised assumptions, we employ realistic, anisotropic electron distributions - obtained from particle transport simulations within complex magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) environments - as input for radio emission models. We use the 3D MHD model COCONUT to generate coronal background configurations, including a CME modelled as a modified Titov-D\'{e}moulin magnetic flux rope (MFR). These MHD simulations are used by the PARADISE particle transport code, which injects energetic electrons into the MFR and tracks their evolution. Finally, we feed the electron distributions and solar wind parameters into the Ultimate Fast Gyrosynchrotron (GS) Codes to compute radio emission along lines of sight. Electrons injected close to the MFR's central axis remain largely confined, producing a GS emission spectrum resembling observed type IV characteristics. Varying observer positions, CME properties, and spectral indices of the electron energy distributions modify the intensities and durations of the observed bursts. The strongest GS emission is observed to originate from the CME flanks. Our results indicate that GS emission is the major component in type IV spectra, although additional contributors cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Transition State Refinement with Learned Equilibrium Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying transition states (TSs), the high-energy configurations that molecules pass through during chemical reactions, is essential for understanding and designing chemical processes. However, accurately and efficiently identifying these states remains one of the most challenging problems in computational chemistry. In this work, we introduce a new generative AI approach that improves the quality of initial guesses for TS structures. Our method can be combined with a variety of existing techniques, including both machine learning models and fast, approximate quantum methods, to refine their predictions and bring them closer to chemically accurate results. Applied to TS guesses from a state-of-the-art machine learning model, our approach reduces the median structural error to just 0.088 $\unicode{x212B}$ and lowers the median absolute error in reaction barrier heights to 0.79 kcal mol$^{-1}$. When starting from a widely used tight-binding approximation, it increases the success rate of locating valid TSs by 41\% and speeds up high-level quantum optimization by a factor of three. By making TS searches more accurate, robust, and efficient, this method could accelerate reaction mechanism discovery and support the development of new materials, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed Aitomia - a platform powered by AI to assist in performing AI-driven atomistic and quantum chemical (QC) simulations. This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running atomistic simulations, monitoring their computational status, analyzing simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in both textual and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting large language models that leverage the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem, supporting AI-enhanced computational chemistry tasks ranging from ground-state to excited-state calculations, including geometry optimizations, thermochemistry, and spectral calculations. The multi-agent implementation enables autonomous executions of the complex computational workflows, such as the computation of the reaction enthalpies. Aitomia is the first intelligent assistant publicly accessible online on a cloud computing platform for atomistic simulations of broad scope (Aitomistic Hub at https://aitomistic.xyz). It may also be deployed locally as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, thereby democratizing simulations and accelerating research and development in relevant fields.</description>

      <title>On the time integration for phase field modeling of grain growth in additive manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase field simulations play a key role in the understanding of microstructure evolution in additive manufacturing. However, they have been found extremely computationally expensive. One of the reasons is the small time step requirement to resolve the complex microstructure evolution during the rapid solidification process. This paper investigates the possibility of using a class of stabilized time integration algorithms to accelerate such phase field simulations by increasing the time steps. The specific time integration formulation and theoretical analysis on energy stability were developed, based on a phase field model dedicated to simulating rapid solidification in additive manufacturing. The numerical results confirmed that the proposed method can ensure the numerical stability and a decreasing energy requirement for the phase field simulations with at least two orders-of-magnitude larger time steps over conventional explicit methods. 2D and 3D phase field simulations have been conducted with relevant physical and kinetic parameters for 316L stainless steels. This work provides a numerical framework for efficient phase field simulations and open numerous opportunities for large scale phase field modeling.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are now being extensively used in our daily lives, spanning across diverse industries as well as academia. In the field of high energy physics (HEP), the most common and challenging task is separating a rare signal from a much larger background. The boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm has been a cornerstone of the high energy physics for analyzing event triggering, particle identification, jet tagging, object reconstruction, event classification, and other related tasks for quite some time. This article presents a comprehensive overview of research conducted by both HEP experimental and phenomenological groups that utilize decision tree algorithms in the context of the Standard Model and Supersymmetry (SUSY). We also summarize the basic concept of machine learning and decision tree algorithm along with the working principle of \texttt{Random Forest}, \texttt{AdaBoost} and two gradient boosting frameworks, such as \texttt{XGBoost}, and \texttt{LightGBM}. Using a case study of electroweakino productions at the high luminosity LHC, we demonstrate how these algorithms lead to improvement in the search sensitivity compared to traditional cut-based methods in both compressed and non-compressed R-parity conserving SUSY scenarios. The effect of different hyperparameters and their optimization, feature importance study using SHapley values are also discussed in detail.</description>

Abstract: Stealthy interactions are an emerging class of nontrivial, bounded long-ranged oscillatory pair potentials with classical ground states that can be disordered, hyperuniform, and infinitely degenerate. Their hybrid crystal-liquid nature endows them with novel physical properties with advantages over their crystalline counterparts. Here, we show the existence of nonequilibrium hard-sphere glasses within this unusual ground-state manifold as the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ tends to zero that are remarkably configurationally extremely close to hyperuniform 3D maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packings. The latter are prototypical glasses since they are maximally disordered, perfectly rigid, and perfectly nonergodic. Our optimization procedure, which leverages the maximum cardinality of the infinite ground-state set, not only guarantees that our packings are hyperuniform with the same structure-factor scaling exponent as the MRJ state, but they share other salient structural attributes, including a packing fraction of $0.638$, a mean contact number per particle of 6, gap exponent of $0.44(1)$, and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ and structures factors $S(k)$ that are virtually identical to one another for all $r$ and $k$, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform packings can be created within the disordered regime ($0 &lt; \chi &lt;1/2$) with heretofore unattained maximal packing fractions. As $\chi$ increases from zero, they always form interparticle contacts, albeit with sparser contact networks as $\chi$ increases from zero, resulting in linear polymer-like chains of contacting particles with increasingly shorter chain lengths. The capacity to generate ultradense stealthy hyperuniform packings for all $\chi$ opens up new materials applications in optics and acoustics.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>

Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Extending Nonlocal Kinetic Energy Density Functionals to Isolated Systems via a Density-Functional-Dependent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wang-Teter-like nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) in the framework of orbital-free density functional theory, while successful in some bulk systems, exhibits a critical Blanc-Cances instability [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 214106 (2005)] when applied to isolated systems, where the total energy becomes unbounded from below. We trace this instability to the use of an ill-defined average charge density, which causes the functional to simultaneously violate the scaling law and the positivity of the Pauli energy. By rigorously constructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these pathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By systematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the resulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an order-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF. In addition, the new KEDF preserves WT's superior accuracy in bulk metals, outperforming the semilocal functionals in both regimes.</description>
