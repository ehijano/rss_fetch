      <title>Band Structure and Pairing Nature of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, evidences of superconductivity with onset temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40$ K) have been detected in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlO substrate at ambient pressure. This progress makes it possible to investigate the pairing mechanism in the bilayer nickelates through adopting various experimental tools. Here we perform a first-principle density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this nickelate superconductor. The obtained band structure is different from that of the pressurized bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ mainly in that the bonding-$d_{z^2}$ band is pushed far ($\approx$ 0.16 eV) below the Fermi level. Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the pseudo-tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer eight-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation approach to investigate the pairing symmetry. The obtained spin susceptibility is maximized at the momentum $Q = (0, 0.86\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone, induced by Fermi-surface nesting, leading to interlayer antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the diagonal double-stripe pattern similar with that reported for the bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The leading and subleading pairing symmetries are the $s^{\pm}$ and approximate $d_{xy}$, which are nearly degenerate. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.</description>

      <title>Properties of two level systems in current-carrying superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low temperatures, the physical properties of disordered solids are dominated by two-level systems (TLS). We show that in disordered superconductors, at sufficiently low frequencies $\omega$, the coupling of TLS to external ac electric fields increases dramatically in the presence of a dc supercurrent. This giant enhancement manifests in all ac linear and nonlinear phenomena. In particular, it leads to a parametric enhancement of the real part of the ac conductivity and, consequently, of the equilibrium current fluctuations. If the distribution of TLS relaxation times is broad, the conductivity is inversely proportional to $\omega$, and the spectrum of the equilibrium current fluctuations takes the form of 1/f noise.</description>

      <title>Surface impedance measurements in superconductors in dc magnetic fields: challenges and relevance to particle physics experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle physics and radio-frequency (RF) superconductivity have driven each other on since the 1970s. The unique properties of superconductors (SC) have been the enabling keys for the realization of accelerators with always increased performances thanks to the realization of all-superconducting cavities. The use of increasingly pure superconducting coatings for accelerating cavities, with lower and lower RF losses, determined such high-quality factors that the need to operate at low temperatures (below the superconducting transition temperature Tc) was well paid for. Recently, with respect to the path followed by the high frequency superconductivity, a new field opened since SCs are being considered for GHz operation in high dc magnetic fields, and measurements (and optimization) of totally different quantities are needed. The possibility of successfully using SCs in high magnetic fields for these purposes is far from obvious and it depends on the outcome of accurate measurements of usually overlooked quantities.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Ising superconductivity induced by $p$-wave magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional magnetic orders usually interplay with superconductivity in intriguing ways. In this work, we propose that a conventional superconductor in proximity to a compensated $p$-wave magnet exhibits behaviors analogous to those of Ising superconductivity found in transition-metal dichalcogenides, which we refer to as pseudo-Ising superconductivity. The pseudo-Ising superconductivity is characterized by several distinctive features: (i) it stays much more robust under strong $p$-wave magnetism than usual ferromagnetism or $d$-wave altermagnetism, thanks to the apparent time-reversal symmetry in $p$-wave spin splitting; (ii) in the low-temperature regime, a second-order superconducting phase transition occurs at a significantly enhanced in-plane upper critical magnetic field $B_{c2}$; (iii) the supercurrent-carrying state establishes non-vanishing out-of-plane spin magnetization, which is forbidden by symmetry in Rahsba and Ising superconductors. We further propose a spin-orbit-free scheme to realize Majorana zero modes by placing superconducting quantum wires on a $p$-wave magnet. Our work establishes a new form of unconventional superconductivity generated by $p$-wave magnetism.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity topological superconductivity in kagome metal RbV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) have sparked considerable interest due to the presence of several intertwined symmetry-breaking phases within a single material. Recently, hysteresis and reentrant superconductivity were observed experimentally through magnetoresistance measurements in RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, providing strong evidence of a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state. The unconventional magnetic responses, combined with crystalline symmetry, impose strong constraints on the possible pairing symmetries of the superconducting state. In this work, we propose that RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an odd-parity superconductor characterized by spin-polarized Cooper pairs. The hysteresis in magnetoresistance and the reentrant superconductivity can both be explained by the formation and evolution of superconducting domains composed of non-unitary pairing. Considering the nodal properties of the kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, it is topological and characterized by Majorana zero modes at its boundary, which can be detected through tunneling experiments.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence of charge- and spin-density waves in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ revealed by $^{139}$La-NQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a transition temperature $T_c$ close to 80 K at high pressures has attracted significant attention, due particularly to a possible density wave (DW) transition occurring near the superconducting dome. Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to the unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest the formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ simultaneously, thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the crystal structure in the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ via nonlinear phononics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Geometric Spin- and Charge Josephson Diode Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general mechanism for large charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures with a noncoplanar spin texture, formulated in terms of quantum-geometric phases. We present necessary conditions for this effect to occur, and show numerical results for disordered materials, relevant for applications. We calculate Josephson diode efficiencies for both charge- and spin-diodes and show that a spin-diode efficiency of 100% can be reached. Finally, we present a SQUID device that can switch between nearly pure spin-up and spin-down equal-spin supercurrents across the ferromagnet by reversing the flux. These findings establish functionalities that are absent for coplanar spin textures.</description>

      <title>Evidence of pseudogap and absence of spin magnetism in the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking state of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon-spin-rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments and the observation of a spontaneous Nernst effect indicate time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS) at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ above the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x\approx0.8$. Further studies have pointed out that BTRS is caused by the formation of a new state of matter associated with the condensation of pairs of electron pairs. Despite exhibiting multiple unconventional effects that warrant further investigation, the electronic spectral properties of this electron quadrupling state remain largely unexplored. Here, we present detailed $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x = 0.77$, which has $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ &gt; $T_{\rm c}$ according to measurements of the spontaneous Nernst effect. The NMR data obtained in this work provide the first direct electronic spectral characteristics of the electron quadrupling state by indicating that it evolves from a pseudogap that sets in at $T^*$ well above $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. This pseudogap behavior is consistent with $\mu$SR Knight-shift, specific-heat, and transport data indicating the formation of a bound state of electrons. According to a theory of electron quadrupling condensates, such bound-state formations should precede the onset of BTRS correlations between pairs of electron pairs. The second important insight from NMR data is the absence of spin-related magnetism. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1T$ and the evolution of the NMR linewidth prove the absence of a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ and rule out even a proximity to some magnetic instability. This indicates that the spontaneous magnetic fields detected in this compound are not caused by spin magnetism but are associated with persistent real-space currents.</description>

      <title>A method based on a dual frequency resonator to estimate physical parameters of superconductors from surface impedance measurements in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High frequency applications of superconductors in a dc magnetic field rely on the estimate of the characteristic crossover frequency $\nu_c$ between low and high losses. Customarily, high sensitivity resonant techniques, intrinsically operating at discrete frequencies, are used to estimate $\nu_c$. We exploit here a method based on a dual frequency resonator. We show that single-frequency evaluations of $\nu_c$ lead to heavy underestimations of the superconductor surface resistance. We describe a combined analytical and experimental approach that gives more accurate estimates for $\nu_c$, and additionally allows to test the underlying physical model.</description>

      <title>Multiterminal Josephson junctions with tunable topological properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the Andreev reflection process at normal-metal/superconductor junctions and the corresponding Andreev bound states in superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor junctions, various multiterminal Josephson junctions have been studied to explore many exotic phases of quantum matter, where the formation of Andreev bound states in the normal region account for dissipationless supercurrent and play a central role in determining exotic properties. Recently, an intriguing aspect of the multiterminal Josephson junctions has been proposed to study the topological properties, wherein the Andreev bound states acquire topological characteristics upon tuning the phase differences of superconducting terminals. In this work, we investigate topologically non-trivial phases in four-terminal Josephson junctions based on square and graphene lattices. Additionally, we apply a gating potential that smoothly drives the Andreev bound states from a topologically non-trivial state to a trivial state. Furthermore, we observe that the gating potential in our setup produces the similar physics of the topological Andreev bound states of the double (single) quantum-dot multiterminal Josephson junctions when the gating potential is small (large) compared to the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Limits of Superconductivity in Metal-Stuffed B-C Clathrates via Ionic Lattice Anharmonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-stuffed B-C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art *ab initio* methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported $(XY)^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_c$ values for $\text{KRbB}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ and $\text{RbB}_{3}\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 87 and 98 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_c$ of 77 K of $\text{KPbB}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_c$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_c$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of point-gapped topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit two distinct topological classifications based on their gap structure: line-gap and point-gap topologies. Although point-gap topology is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, its systematic construction remains a challenge. Here, we present the Floquet engineering approach for realizing point-gapped topological superconductors. By combining Floquet theory with particle-hole symmetry (PHS), we show that a point gap hosting robust Majorana edge modes emerges at the overlap of Floquet bands with opposite winding numbers. In the thermodynamic limit, even weak non-Hermiticity opens a point gap from a gapless spectrum, driving a topological phase transition and breaking non-Bloch parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. This transition is accompanied by the appearance of the Floquet $Z_2$ skin effect. Furthermore, the point-gapped topological phase and the non-Bloch $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry exhibit size-dependent phenomena driven by the critical skin effect. Our work offers a new pathway for exploring the point-gapped topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Orientation dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate de Gennes and Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. In a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet can generate de Gennes and Saint-James states in a short junction due to the enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors, resulting in the vanishing zero-biased conductance peak with pronounced resonance spikes in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the de Gennes and Saint-James states are not found for $d_{xy}$-altermagnet in the short junction but can be formed in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I\left( \varphi \right) $ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi $ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $ d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $ d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</description>

      <title>Strong phonon-mediated high temperature superconductivity in Li$_2$AuH$_6$ under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum-geometric charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized hybrid structures with noncoplanar spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the spin-resolved Josephson diode effect (JDE) in strongly spin-polarized ferromagnets (sFM) coupled to singlet superconductors (SC) via ferromagnetic insulating interfaces (FI). All metallic parts are described in the framework of the quasiclassical Usadel Green's function theory applicable to diffusive systems. The interfaces are characterized by an S-matrix obtained for a model potential with exchange vectors pointing in an arbitrary direction with respect to the magnetization in the sFM. Our theory predicts a large charge Josephson diode effect with an efficiency exceeding $33\%$ and a perfect spin diode effect with $100\%$ efficiency. To achieve these the following conditions are necessary: (i) a noncoplanar profile of the three magnetization vectors in the system and (ii) different densities of states of spin-$\uparrow$ and spin-$\downarrow$ bands in the sFM achieved by a strong spin polarization. The former gives rise to the quantum-geometric phase, $\Delta\varphi$, that enters the theory in a very similar manner as the superconducting phase difference across the junction, $\Delta\chi$. We perform a harmonic analysis of the Josephson current in both variables and find symmetries between Fourier coefficients allowing an interpretation in terms of transfer processes of multiple equal-spin Cooper pairs across the two ferromagnetic spin bands. We point out the importance of crossed pair transmission processes. Finally, we study a spin-switching effect of an equal-spin supercurrent by reversing the magnetic flux in a SQUID device incorporating the mentioned junction and propose a way for measuring it.</description>

      <title>Frozonium: Freezing Anharmonicity in Floquet Superconducting Circuits</title>

Abstract: Floquet engineering is a powerful method that can be used to modify the properties of interacting many-body Hamiltonians via the application of periodic time-dependent drives. Here we consider the physics of an inductively shunted superconducting Josephson junction in the presence of Floquet drives in the fluxonium regime and beyond, which we dub the frozonium artificial atom. We find that in the vicinity of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency, the many-body dynamics can be tuned to that of an effectively linear bosonic oscillator, with additional nonlinear corrections that are suppressed in higher powers of the drive frequency. By analyzing the inverse participation ratios between the time-evolved frozonium wavefunctions and the eigenbasis of a linear oscillator, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a novel dynamical control using a combination of numerical exact diagonalization and Floquet-Magnus expansion. We discuss the physics of resonances between quasi-energy states induced by the drive, and ways to mitigate their effects. We also highlight the enhanced protection of frozonium against external sources of noise present in experimental setups. This work lays the foundation for future applications in quantum memory and bosonic quantum control using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Hybridization induced quantum phase transition in bilayer Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental report on the pressure induced superconductor-insulator transition in cuprate superconductors as well as the superconductivity of the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, we systematically investigated the single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model in the regime of large interlayer hybridization to mimic the pressure effects. We map out the phase diagram of interlayer hybridization versus density in the regime of intermediate to strong hybridization. In particular, we found that the sufficiently strong hybridization can destroy the $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing and induces its transition to correlated metallic, pseudogap, and Fermi liquid phases depending on the doping regime. The phase diagram hosted by the bilayer model implies its role as the versatile platform to explore the pressure effects on the two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover physics of Hubbard-type models.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars with unconventional superconducting pairing symmetries via multibody interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multibody interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multibody interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has a constant interaction energy by canceling the two-body and multibody interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). Particularly, the constructed eigenstates have off-site pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum, which leads to superconducting states with either even-parity and spin-triplet or odd-parity and spin-singlet symmetry. We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multibody interactions has the spin-triplet $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, entanglement entropy, and level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including spin-triplet $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice and spin-singlet $p$-wave pairing states in a one-dimensional chain. These findings open up the possibility of realizing nonequilibrium unconventional superconductivity in a long-lived manner protected against thermalization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Modelling of Anharmonicity and Quantum Effects in PdCuH$_2$ with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum nuclear effects and anharmonicity impact a wide range of functional materials and their properties. One of the most powerful techniques to model these effects is the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). Unfortunately, the SSCHA is extremely computationally expensive, prohibiting its routine use. We propose a protocol that pairs machine learning interatomic potentials, which can be tailored for the system at hand via active learning, with the SSCHA. Our method leverages an upscaling procedure that allows for the treatment of supercells of up to thousands of atoms with practically minimal computational effort. The protocol is applied to PdCuH$_x$ ($x = 0-2$) compounds, chosen because previous experimental studies have reported superconducting critical temperatures, $T_\text{c}$s, as high as 17~K at ambient pressures in an unknown hydrogenated PdCu phase. We identify a $P4/mmm$ PdCuH$_2$ structure, which is shown to be dynamically stable only upon the inclusion of quantum fluctuations, as being a key contributor to the measured superconductivity. For this system, our methodology is able to reduce the computational expense for the SSCHA calculations by $\sim$96\%. The proposed protocol opens the door towards the routine inclusion of quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity in materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting flip-chip interconnects are crucial for the three-dimensional integration of superconducting circuits in sensing and quantum technology applications. We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip-chip device using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built transfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films. We use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump metallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting wiring layer and the indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly can transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest geometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer and not by the indium interconnect. We show that the pressed indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding 1A due to its large size of about 500 micrometer diameter. Our flip-chip assembly does not require electroplating nor patterning of indium. The assembly process does not need a flip-chip bonder and can be realized with a transfer stage using a top chip with transparency or through-vias for alignment. These flip-chip devices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting interconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Correlation between unconventional superconductivity and strange metallicity revealed by operando superfluid density measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strange-metal behavior has been observed in superconductors ranging from cuprates to pressurized nickelates, but its relationship to unconventional superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we perform operando superfluid density measurements on ion-gated FeSe films. We observe for the first time a synchronized evolution of superconducting condensate and the strange-metal phase with electron doping. A linear scaling between zero-temperature superfluid density and the strange-metal resistivity coefficient is further established, which nails down a direct link between the formation of superfluid in the superconducting state and the scattering of carriers in the strange-metal normal state. Remarkably, the scaling also applies for different iron-based and cuprate superconductors despite their distinct electronic structures and pairing symmetries. Such a correlation can be reproduced in a theoretical calculation on the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model by considering a cooperative effect of quantum critical fluctuation and disorder. These findings indicate a fundamental principle governing superconducting condensation and strange-metal scattering in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the orbital flux phase in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ from polar Kerr effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) family of Kagome metals hosts unconventional charge density wave order whose nature is still an open puzzle. Accumulated evidences point to a time-reversal symmetry breaking orbital flux phase that carries loop currents. Such an order may support anomalous Hall effect. However, the polar Kerr effect measurements that probe the a.c. anomalous Hall conductivity seems to have yielded contradictory results. We first argue on symmetry grounds that some previously proposed orbital flux order, most notably the one with Star-of-David distortion, shall not give rise to anomalous Hall or polar Kerr effects. We further take the tri-hexagonal orbital flux phase as an exemplary Kagome flux order that does exhibit anomalous Hall response, and show that the Kerr rotation angle at two relevant experimental optical frequencies generally reaches microradians to sub-milliradians levels. A particularly sharp resonance enhancement is observed at around $\hbar \omega =1$ eV, suggesting exceedingly large Kerr rotation at the corresponding probing frequencies not yet accessed by previous experiments. Our study can help to interpret the Kerr measurements on $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and to eventually resolve the nature of their CDW order.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced Majorana modes in a nodal topological superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phase diagram of an extension of the Haldane model with equal spin pairing superconductivity. In two dimensions, we find a topological nodal superconducting phase, which exhibits a chiral Majorana mode propagating along the edges of nanoribbons with cylindrical boundary conditions. This phase is however unstable in a finite two-dimensional rectangular-shaped lattice, yielding corner states close to zero energy in a flake with alternating zigzag and armchair edges. When we reduce one of the dimensions, quantum confinement gaps out the bulk bands faster than the edge states. In this scenario, hybridization between the edge states can then result in Majorana zero modes. Our results hence suggest quantum confinement as a crucial ingredient in building quasi-one-dimensional topological superconducting phases out of two-dimensional nodal topological superconductors. Furthermore, we characterize the emergence of this novel topological phase by means of its topological invariant, coinciding with a quantized conductance of $2 e^2/h$ in a normal-superconducting junction.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an exact formula for the phonon linewidths involving only dressed electron-phonon couplings and ensuring the positivity property. The formula is designed to account for both nonadiabatic and correlation effects, and it provides an alternative proof that Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations of phonon linewidths are not affected by a double counting of screening diagrams. Furthermore, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios and offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann equation.</description>

Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum-metric-induced giant and reversible nonreciprocal transport phenomena in chiral loop-current phases of kagome metals</title>

Abstract: Rich spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, the emergence of chiral loop-current order, accompanied by time-reversal symmetry-symmetry breaking in various kagome metals, has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV3Sb5, which provides compelling evidence of time-reversal-symmetry and inversion-symmetry breakings. However, the underlying essence of this observation has remained obscured due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we reveal that the loop-current order causes giant and reversible eMChA coefficient, $\gamma_{eM}$, is proportional to the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ times the lifetime of conduction electrons $\tau$. In kagome metals, the derived $\gamma_{eM}$ is substantial and reversible by minute magnetic fields, due to the large $\tau (\gg a_0/v_{Fermi})$ and the field-induced reversal of $M_{orb}$. By considering the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, the loop-current state becomes non-centrosymmetric, thereby giving rise to the eMChA. Surprisingly, the quantum-metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by $\sim100$ times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals, but also opens a new path for exploring quantum-metric-induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated metals</description>

      <title>Circuit Quantisation from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</description>

      <title>Cascades in transport and optical conductivity of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>
