      <title>SODAs: Sparse Optimization for the Discovery of Differential and Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) integrate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with algebraic constraints, providing a fundamental framework for developing models of dynamical systems characterized by timescale separation, conservation laws, and physical constraints. While sparse optimization has revolutionized model development by allowing data-driven discovery of parsimonious models from a library of possible equations, existing approaches for dynamical systems assume DAEs can be reduced to ODEs by eliminating variables before model discovery. This assumption limits the applicability of such methods to DAE systems with unknown constraints and time scales. We introduce Sparse Optimization for Differential-Algebraic Systems (SODAs), a data-driven method for the identification of DAEs in their explicit form. By discovering the algebraic and dynamic components sequentially without prior identification of the algebraic variables, this approach leads to a sequence of convex optimization problems and has the advantage of discovering interpretable models that preserve the structure of the underlying physical system. To this end, SODAs improves numerical stability when handling high correlations between library terms -- caused by near-perfect algebraic relationships -- by iteratively refining the conditioning of the candidate library. We demonstrate the performance of our method on biological, mechanical, and electrical systems, showcasing its robustness to noise in both simulated time series and real-time experimental data.</description>

      <title>Exchange of Intervals and Intrinsic Ergodicity of the Negative Beta shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work highlights a peculiar phenomenon of interval exchange. Considering a real number beta less than -1, the negative beta-shift is coded if and only if its absolute value is greater than the golden ratio. We study an increasing sequence of algebraic integers with limit-1 and the absolute value of the first term equals to the golden ratio such that for a base x taken in the interval of consicutive terms of this sequence, the measure of the maximal entropy is carried by the image of a beta-shift, with the golden ratio les than the absolute value of beta, under the mapping of an injective substitution.</description>

      <title>Local inverse measure-theoretic entropy for endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of local inverse metric entropy along backward trajectories for ergodic measures preserved by endomorphisms (non-invertible maps) on a compact metric space. A second notion of inverse measure entropy is defined by using measurable partitions. Our notions have several useful applications. Inverse entropy can distinguish between isomorphism classes of endomorphisms on Lebesgue spaces, when they have the same forward measure-theoretic entropy. In a general setting we prove that the local inverse entropy of an ergodic measure \mu is equal to the forward entropy minus the folding entropy. The inverse entropy of hyperbolic measures on compact manifolds is explored, focusing on their negative Lyapunov exponents. We compute next the inverse entropy of the inverse SRB measure on a hyperbolic repellor. We prove an entropy rigidity result for special Anosov endomorphisms of \mathbb T^2, namely that they can be classified up to smooth conjugacy by knowing the entropy of their SRB measure and the inverse entropy of their inverse SRB measure. Next we study the relations between our inverse measure-theoretic entropy and the generalized topological inverse entropy on subsets of prehistories. In general we establish a Partial Variational Principle for inverse entropy. We obtain also a Full Variational Principle for inverse entropy in the case of special TA-covering maps on tori. In the end, several examples of endomorphisms are studied, such as fat baker transformations, fat solenoidal attractors, special Anosov endomorphisms, toral endomorphisms, and the local inverse entropy is computed for their SRB measures.</description>

      <title>Rate distortion dimension and ergodic decomposition for $\mathbb{R}^d$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate distortion dimension describes the theoretical limit of lossy data compression methods as the distortion bound goes to zero. It was originally introduced in the context of information theory, and recently it was discovered that it has an intimate connection to Gromov's theory of mean dimension of dynamical systems. This paper studies the behavior of rate distortion dimension of $\mathbb{R}^d$-actions under ergodic decomposition. Our main theorems provide natural convexity and concavity of upper and lower rate distortion dimensions under convex combination of invariant probability measures. We also present examples which clarify the validity and limitations of the theorems.</description>

      <title>Conservative Coexpanding on Average Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the generator of a conservative IID random system which expands on average codimension 1 planes has an essential spectral radius strictly smaller than $1$ on Sobolev spaces of small negative index. Consequently, such a system has finitely many ergodic components. If there is only one component for each power of the random system, then the system enjoys multiple exponential mixing and the central limit theorem. Moreover, these properties are stable under small perturbations. As an application we show that many small perturbations of random homogeneous systems are exponentially mixing.</description>

      <title>Outer billiards in the complex hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a quadratically convex compact connected oriented hypersurface $N$ of the complex hyperbolic plane, we prove that the characteristic rays of the symplectic form restricted to $N$ determine a double geodesic foliation of the exterior $U$ of $N$. This induces an outer billiard map $B$ on $U$. We prove that $B$ is a diffeomorphism (notice that weaker notions of strict convexity may allow the billiard map to be well-defined and invertible, but not smooth) and moreover, a symplectomorphism. These results generalize known geometric properties of the outer billiard maps in the hyperbolic plane and complex Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>On the stability of a penalty function of the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-hard square shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of maximizing measures for a penalty function of a two-dimensional subshift of finite type, building on the work of Gonschorowski et al. \cite{GQS}. In the one-dimensional case, such measures remain stable under Lipschitz perturbations for any subshift of finite type. However, instability arises in a penalty function of the Robinson tiling, which is a two-dimensional subshift of finite type with no periodic point and zero entropy. This raises the question of whether stability persists in two-dimensional subshifts of finite type with positive topological entropy. In this paper, we address this question by studying the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-hard square shift, a well-known example of a two-dimensional subshift with positive entropy. Our main theorem establishes that, in contrast to previous results, a penalty function of the hard square shift remains stable under Lipschitz perturbations.</description>

      <title>Evans function, parity and nonautonomous bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of parity due to Fitzpatrick, Pejsachowicz and Rabier is a central tool in the abstract bifurcation theory of nonlinear Fredholm operators. In this paper, we relate the parity to the Evans function, which is widely used in the stability analysis for traveling wave solutions to evolutionary PDEs.
  As application we obtain a flexible and general condition yielding local bifurcations of specific bounded entire solutions to (Carath{\'e}odory) differential equations. These bifurcations are intrinsically nonautonomous in the sense that the assumptions implying them cannot be fulfilled for autonomous or periodic temporal forcings. In addition, we demonstrate that Evans functions are strictly related to the dichotomy spectrum and hyperbolicity, which play a crucial role in studying the existence of bounded solutions on the whole real line and therefore the recent field of nonautonomous bifurcation theory. Finally, by means of non-trivial examples we illustrate the applicability of our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for high-order persistence of resonant caustics in perturbed circular billiards. The main tool is a perturbation theory based on the Bialy-Mironov generating function for convex billiards. All resonant caustics with period $q$ persist up to order $\lceil q/n \rceil -1$ under any polynomial deformation of the circle of degree $n$.</description>

      <title>Fourier transform of nonlinear images of self-similar measures: quantitative aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper relates to the Fourier decay properties of images of self-similar measures $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^k$ under nonlinear smooth maps $f \colon \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}$. For example, we prove that if the linear parts of the similarities defining $\mu$ commute and the graph of $f$ has nonvanishing Gaussian curvature, then the Fourier dimension of the image measure is at least $\max\left\{ \frac{2(2\kappa_2 - k)}{4 + 2\kappa_* - k} , 0 \right\}$, where $\kappa_2$ is the lower correlation dimension of $\mu$ and $\kappa_*$ is the Assouad dimension of the support of $\mu$. Under some additional assumptions on $\mu$, we use recent breakthroughs in the fractal uncertainty principle to obtain further improvements for the decay exponents.
  We give several applications to nonlinear arithmetic of self-similar sets $F$ in the line. For example, we prove that if $\dim_{\mathrm H} F &gt; (\sqrt{65} - 5)/4 = 0.765\dots$ then the arithmetic product set $F \cdot F = \{ xy : x,y \in F \}$ has positive Lebesgue measure, while if $\dim_{\mathrm H} F &gt; (-3 + \sqrt{41})/4 = 0.850\dots$ then $F \cdot F \cdot F$ has non-empty interior. One feature of the above results is that they do not require any separation conditions on the self-similar sets.</description>

      <title>Controllability in a class of cancer therapy models with co-evolving resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive therapy is a recent paradigm in cancer treatment aiming at indefinite, safe containment of the disease when cure is judged unattainable. In modeling this approach, inherent limitations arise due to the structure of the vector fields and the bounds imposed by toxic side-effects of the drug. In this work we analyze these limitations in a minimal class of models describing a cancer population with a slowly co-evolving drug resistance trait. Chemotherapeutic treatment is introduced as any bounded time-varying input, forcing the cells to adapt to a changing environment. We leverage the affine structure and low dimension of the system to explicitly construct controllable subsets of the state space enclosing sets of equilibria. We show that these controllable sets entirely determine the asymptotic behavior of all trajectories that cannot lead to a cure.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear resonance in systems with decaying perturbations and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of multiplicative white noise on the resonance capture in non-isochronous systems with time-decaying pumping is investigated. It is assumed that the intensity of perturbations decays with time, and its frequency is asymptotically constant. The occurrence of attractive solutions with an amplitude close to the resonant value and a phase synchronized with the excitation are considered. The persistence of such a regime in a stochastically perturbed system is analyzed. By combining the averaging method and the construction of suitable stochastic Lyapunov functions, conditions are derived that guarantee the stochastic stability of the resonant modes on infinite or asymptotically large time intervals. The proposed theory is applied to the Duffing oscillator with decaying parametric excitation and noise.</description>

      <title>Data-driven continuation of patterns and their bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns and nonlinear waves, such as spots, stripes, and rotating spirals, arise prominently in many natural processes and in reaction-diffusion models. Our goal is to compute boundaries between parameter regions with different prevailing patterns and waves. We accomplish this by evolving randomized initial data to full patterns and evaluate feature functions, such as the number of connected components or their area distribution, on their sublevel sets. The resulting probability measure on the feature space, which we refer to as pattern statistics, can then be compared at different parameter values using the Wasserstein distance. We show that arclength predictor-corrector continuation can be used to trace out transition and bifurcation curves in parameter space by maximizing the distance of the pattern statistics. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through a range of examples involving homogeneous states, spots, stripes, and spiral waves.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Koopman Operator Approximation for Nonlinear Systems Using Broading Learning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional control methods often show limitations in dealing with complex nonlinear systems, especially when it is difficult to accurately obtain the exact system model, and the control accuracy and stability are difficult to guarantee. To solve this problem, the Koopman operator theory provides an effective method to linearise nonlinear systems, which simplifies the analysis and control of the system by mapping the nonlinear dynamics into a high-dimensional space. However, the existing extended dynamical mode decomposition (EDMD) methods suffer from randomness in the selection of basis functions, which leads to bias in the finite-dimensional approximation to the Koopman operator, thus affecting the accuracy of model prediction. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a BLS-EDMD method based on the Broad learning system (BLS) network. The method achieves a high-precision approximation to the Koopman operator by learning more accurate basis functions, which significantly improves the prediction ability of the model. Building on this, we further develop a model predictive controller (MPC) called BE-MPC. This controller directly utilises the high-dimensional and high-precision predictors generated by BLS-EDMD to predict the system state more accurately, thus achieving precise control of the underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV), and its effectiveness is verified by simulation.</description>

      <title>Functional perturbation theory under axisymmetry: Simplified formulae and their uses for tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strictly axisymmetric configurations of tokamaks, field-line tracing reduces from a three-dimensional ODE system to a two-dimensional one, where Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem applies and guarantees the nonexistence of chaos. The formulae of functional perturbation theory (FPT) mostly simplify to compact closed-form expressions to allow the computation to finish instantly, which could improve and accelerate the existing plasma control systems by detangling the plasma dynamics from the magnetic topology change. FPT can conveniently calculate how the key geometric objects of magnetic topology:
  1. the divertor X-point(s) and the magnetic axis,
  2. the last closed flux surface (LCFS)
  3. flux surfaces
  change under perturbation. For example, when the divertor X-point shifts outwards, the LCFS there must expand accordingly, but not necessarily for other places of the LCFS, which could also contract, depending on the perturbation. FPT can not only facilitate adaptive control of plasma, but also enable utilizing as much as possible space in the vacuum vessel by weakening the plasma-wall interaction (PWI) via tuning the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{DP}^m$ of the divertor X-point(s), such that the field line connection lengths in the scrape-off layer (SOL) are long enough to achieve detachment. Increasing flux expansion $f_x$ is another option for detachment and can also be facilitated by FPT.
  Apart from the edge, FPT can also benefit the understanding of the plasma core. Since the magnetic axis O-point would also shift under perturbation and the shift is known by FPT, the O-point can be controlled without full knowledge of the plasma response, which shall not significantly change the tendency.</description>

      <title>Recursive Estimation for Dynamical Systems with Measurement Bias, Outliers and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes recursive algorithms for state estimation of linear dynamical systems when measurements are noisy with unknown bias and/or outliers. For situations with noisy and biased measurements, algorithms are proposed that minimize $\epsilon$ insensitive loss function. In this approach which is often used in Support Vector Machines, small errors are ignored making the algorithm less sensitive to measurement bias. Apart from $\epsilon$ insensitive quadratic loss function, estimation algorithms are also presented for $\epsilon$ insensitive Huber M loss function which provides good performance in presence of both small noises as well as outliers. The advantage of Huber cost function based estimator in presence of outliers is due to the fact the error penalty function switches from quadratic to linear for errors beyond a certain threshold. For both objective functions, estimation algorithms are extended to cases when there are additional constraints on states and exogenous signals such as known range of some states or exogenous signals or measurement noises. Interestingly, the filtering algorithms are recursive and structurally similar to Kalman filter with the main difference being that the updates based on the new measurement ("innovation term") are based on solution of a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.</description>

      <title>The Dry Ten Martini Problem for $C^2$ cosine-type quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper solves ``The Dry Ten Martini Problem'' for $C^2$ cosine-type quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators with large coupling constants and Diophantine frequencies, a model originally introduced by Sinai in 1987 \cite{sinai}. This shows that the analyticity assumption on the potential is not essential for obtaining a dry Cantor spectrum and can be replaced by a certain geometric condition in the low regularity case. In addition, we prove the homogeneity of the spectrum and the absolute continuity of the integrated density of states (IDS).</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volterra integral and integro-differential equations have been extensively studied in both pure mathematics and applied science. In one direction, developments in analysis have yielded far-ranging existence, uniqueness, and regularity results. In the other, applications in science have inspired a substantial library of practical techniques to deal with such equations.
  The present work connects these research areas by examining five large classes of linear Volterra equations: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone (CM) kernels, corresponding to linear viscoelastic models; those with positive definite (PD) kernels, corresponding to partially-observed quantum systems; difference equations with PD kernels; a class of generalized delay differential equations; and a class of generalized fractional differential equations. We develop a system of correspondences between these problems, showing that all five can be understood within the same, spectral theory. We leverage this theory to recover practical, closed-form solutions of all five classes, and we show that interconversion yields a natural, continuous involution within each class. Our work unifies several results from science: the interconversion formula of Gross, recent results in viscoelasticity and operator theory for integral equations of the second type, classical formulas for Prony series and fractional differential equations, and the convergence of Prony series to CM kernels. Finally, our theory yields a novel, geometric construction of the regularized Hilbert transform, extends it to a wide class of infinite measures, and reveals a natural connection to delay and fractional differential equations.
  We leverage our theory to develop a powerful, spectral method to handle scalar Volterra equations numerically, and illustrate it with a number of practical examples.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Structural Deflection Estimation in Hydraulically Actuated Systems Using 3D Flexible Multibody Simulation and DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision, stability, and performance of lightweight high-strength steel structures in heavy machinery is affected by their highly nonlinear dynamics. This, in turn, makes control more difficult, simulation more computationally intensive, and achieving real-time autonomy, using standard approaches, impossible. Machine learning through data-driven, physics-informed and physics-inspired networks, however, promises more computationally efficient and accurate solutions to nonlinear dynamic problems. This study proposes a novel framework that has been developed to estimate real-time structural deflection in hydraulically actuated three-dimensional systems. It is based on SLIDE, a machine-learning-based method to estimate dynamic responses of mechanical systems subjected to forced excitations.~Further, an algorithm is introduced for the data acquisition from a hydraulically actuated system using randomized initial configurations and hydraulic pressures.~The new framework was tested on a hydraulically actuated flexible boom with various sensor combinations and lifting various payloads. The neural network was successfully trained in less time using standard parameters from PyTorch, ADAM optimizer, the various sensor inputs, and minimal output data. The SLIDE-trained neural network accelerated deflection estimation solutions by a factor of $10^7$ in reference to flexible multibody simulation batches and provided reasonable accuracy. These results support the studies goal of providing robust, real-time solutions for control, robotic manipulators, structural health monitoring, and automation problems.</description>

      <title>Micro-local analysis of contact Anosov flows and band structure of the Ruelle spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a geometrical micro-local analysis of contact Anosov flow, such as geodesic flow on negatively curved manifold. This micro-local analysis is based on wave-packet transform discussed in arXiv:1706.09307. The main result is that the transfer operator is well approximated (in the high frequency limit) by the quantization of the Hamiltonian flow naturally defined from the contact Anosov flow and extended to some vector bundle over the symplectization set. This gives a few important consequences: the discrete eigenvalues of the generator of transfer operators, called Ruelle spectrum, are structured into vertical bands. If the right-most band is isolated from the others, most of the Ruelle spectrum in it concentrate along a line parallel to the imaginary axis and, further, the density satisfies a Weyl law as the imaginary part tend to infinity. Some of these results were announced in arXiv:1301.5525.</description>

      <title>Outer billiards in the spaces of oriented geodesics of the three dimensional space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.01679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M_{\kappa }$ be the three-dimensional space form of constant curvature $\kappa =0,1,-1$, that is, Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the sphere $S^{3} $, or hyperbolic space $H^{3}$. Let $S$ be a smooth, closed, strictly convex surface in $M_{\kappa }$. We define an outer billiard map $B$ on the four dimensional space $\mathcal{G}_{\kappa }$ of oriented complete geodesics of $M_{\kappa }$, for which the billiard table is the subset of $\mathcal{G}_{\kappa }$ consisting of all oriented geodesics not intersecting $S$. We show that $B$ is a diffeomorphism when $S$ is quadratically convex.
  For $\kappa =1,-1$, $\mathcal{G}_{\kappa }$ has a K\"{a}hler structure associated with the Killing form of $\operatorname{Iso}(M_{\kappa })$. We prove that $B$ is a symplectomorphism with respect to its fundamental form and that $B$ can be obtained as an analogue to the construction of Tabachnikov of the outer billiard in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ defined in terms of the standard symplectic structure. We show that $B$ does not preserve the fundamental symplectic form on $\mathcal{G}_{\kappa }$ associated with the cross product on $M_{\kappa }$, for $\kappa =0,1,-1$.
  We initiate the dynamical study of this outer billiard in the hyperbolic case by introducing and discussing a notion of holonomy for periodic points.</description>

      <title>Cantor Set Structure of the Weak Stability Boundary for Infinitely Many Cycles in the Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometry of the weak stability boundary region for the planar restricted three-body problem about the secondary mass point has been an open problem. Previous studies have conjectured that it may have a fractal structure. In this paper, this region is studied for infinitely many cycles about the secondary mass point, instead of a finite number studied previously. It is shown that in this case the boundary consists of a family of infinitely many Cantor sets and is thus fractal in nature. It is also shown that on two-dimensional surfaces of section, it is the boundary of a region only having bounded cycling motion for infinitely many cycles, while the complement of this region generally has unbounded motion. It is shown that that this shares many properties of a Mandelbrot set. Its relationship to the non-existence of KAM tori is described, among many other properties. Applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Roots of Alexander polynomials of random positive 3-braids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an observation of Dehornoy, we study the roots of Alexander polynomials of knots and links that are closures of positive 3-strand braids. We give experimental data on random such braids and find that the roots exhibit marked patterns, which we refine into precise conjectures. We then prove several results along those lines, for example that generically at least 69% of the roots are on the unit circle, which appears to be sharp. We also show there is a large root-free region near the origin. We further study the equidistribution properties of such roots by introducing a Lyapunov exponent of the Burau representation of random positive braids, and a corresponding bifurcation measure. In the spirit of Deroin and Dujardin, we conjecture that the bifurcation measure gives the limiting measure for such roots, and prove this on a region with positive limiting mass. We use tools including work of Gambaudo and Ghys on the signature function of links, for which we prove a central limit theorem.</description>

Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

Abstract: For a convergence group equipped with an expanding coarse-cocycle, we construct finitely generated free subsemigroups, which we call $\textit{Bishop--Jones}$ $\textit{semigroups}$, of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than the critical exponent of the ambient group. As an application, we show that for any non-elementary transverse subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$, there exist finitely generated free Anosov subsemigroups in the sense of Kassel--Potrie of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than that of the ambient transverse group. Furthermore, we show that these semigroups admit $\mathcal{C}$-regular quasi-isometric embeddings into the symmetric space $X$ of $G$, in the sense of Kapovich--Leeb--Porti.</description>

      <title>Age Group Sensitivity Analysis of Epidemic Models: Investigating the Impact of Contact Matrix Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the role of different age groups in disease transmission is crucial for designing effective intervention strategies. A key parameter in age-structured epidemic models is the contact matrix, which defines the interaction structure between age groups. However, accurately estimating contact matrices is challenging, as different age groups respond differently to surveys and are accessible through different channels. This variability introduces significant epistemic uncertainty in epidemic models.
  In this study, we introduce the Age Group Sensitivity Analysis (AGSA) method, a novel framework for assessing the impact of age-structured contact patterns on epidemic outcomes. Our approach integrates age-stratified epidemic models with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) method, enabling a systematic sensitivity analysis of age-specific interactions. Additionally, we propose a new sensitivity aggregation technique that quantifies the contribution of each age group to key epidemic parameters.
  By identifying the age groups to which the model is most sensitive, AGSA helps pinpoint those that introduce the greatest epistemic uncertainty. This allows for targeted data collection efforts, focusing surveys and empirical studies on the most influential age groups to improve model accuracy. As a result, AGSA can enhance epidemic forecasting and inform the design of more effective and efficient public health interventions.</description>
