      <title>Low-Loss Higher-Order Cross-Sectional Lam\'e Mode SAW Devices in 10-20 GHz Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents surface acoustic wave (SAW) acoustic delay lines (ADL) for studying propagation loss mechanisms in Lithium Niobate (LN). Devices were fabricated by depositing 50 nm aluminum patterns on 600 nm X-Cut LN on amorphous silicon on silicon carbide, where longitudinally dominant SAW was targeted. Upon fabrication, higher-order thickness-based cross-sectional Lam\'e modes and Rayleigh modes were studied for their Q factors using acoustic delay lines. Utilizing bi-directional electrodes, ADL with lateral lambda values ranging from 0.4 um to 0.6 um were measured. Higher order Lame modes were found to have consistently higher Q factors than their Rayleigh mode counterpart, on the order of 1000-3000, showing high-frequency SAW devices as still viable candidates for frequency scaling without a substantial increase in loss.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of ballistic to diffusive transition in AlN thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk AlN possesses high thermal conductivity due to long phonon mean-free-paths, high group velocity, and long lifetimes. However, the thermal transport scenario becomes very different in a thin AlN film due to phonon-defect and phonon-boundary scattering. Herein, we report experimental observation of ballistic to diffusive transition in a series of AlN thin films (1.6 - 2440 nm) grown on sapphire substrates. The ballistic transport is characterized by constant thermal resistance as a function of film thickness due to phonon scattering by defects and boundaries. In this transport regime, phonons possess very small group velocities and lifetimes. The lifetime of the optical phonons increases by more than an order of magnitude in the diffusive regime, however, remains nearly constant afterwards. Our study is important for understanding the details of nano and microscale thermal transport in a highly conductive material.</description>

      <title>A rapid experimental workflow for studying melt track scaling in laser powder bed fusion using high-precision metal template substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development and qualification of process parameters in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) commonly involves many variables. At the outset of development, whether transferring known parameters to a new machine, or exploring a new material, single-track and single-layer experiments are a convenient means of down-selecting key variables and exploring parameter scaling behavior. We present an experimental workflow for single-layer LPBF experiments using etched high-precision metal template substrates, overcoming challenges with precision single-layer alignment in LPBF systems and enabling efficient processing and cross-sectional analysis. Templates are fabricated using chemical etching and machining, and are characterized using optical profilometry and X-ray transmission imaging of powder layers. Using the templates a single-track parameter study is performed in SS316 including three powder layer thicknesses, and spanning common laser melting modes (lack-of-fusion, conduction, and keyhole mode). Analysis of melt track geometries using automated image processing allows a scaling law to be applied to define the process window, quantifying the amount of material added with increasing powder layer thickness. Single-track results are verified with raster scanning experiments, showing the potential to transfer single-track results to full LPBF builds.</description>

      <title>Optimization of a Microsphere-based Variable Density Multilayer Insulation System for Cryogenic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the standard composite insulation systems for cryogenic applications consists of a layer of hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) followed by a layer of variable density multilayer insulation (VDMLI) comprised of various internal combinations of reflectors and spacers. Microstructural effects of the HGM assembly and convection between the vessel and its surroundings are unaccounted for in existing calculations, which the current study incorporates in the unit cell-based HGM analytical model. Building on it, the insulation performance of the HGM layer with increasing thickness is studied for a Dewar insulation system containing liquid nitrogen (boiling point 78 K) based on pressures ranging from high vacuum (0.0133 Pa) to atmospheric (105 Pa) for two benchmark cryogenic vessel sizes. A suitable range of thickness for both systems is suggested. Further, the performance of four arithmetic progression-based VDMLI profiles in combination with an optimal HGM layer is studied. A VDMLI configuration with repeating spacer layers is found to perform best in high-pressure conditions. Finally, based on heat transfer performance within the given range of pressures and warm boundary temperatures up to 393 K, optimal thickness values of 120-130mm for the HGM layer and 125mm for the best VDMLI configuration are reported.</description>

      <title>TCAD Simulation of Novel Multi-Spacer HK/MG 28nm Planar MOSFET for Sub-threshold Swing and DIBL Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study optimizes 28 nm planar MOSFET technology to reduce device leakage current and enhance switching speed. The specific aims are to decrease subthreshold swing (S.S.) and mitigate drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect. Silvaco TCAD software is used for process (Athena) and device (Atlas) simulations. For the further development of MOSFET technology, we implemented our device (planar 28 nm n-MOSFET) with high-k metal-gate (HK/MG), lightly doped drain (LDD), multiple spacers (mult-spacers), and silicide. Simulation validation shows improvements over other 28 nm devices, with lower static power consumption and notable optimizations in both S.S. (69.8 mV/dec) and DIBL effect (30.5 mV/V).</description>

      <title>Tunable membrane-less dielectrophoretic microfiltration by crossing interdigitated electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filtration is a crucial step in the analysis of living microparticles. In particular, the selective microfiltration of phytoplankton by size and shape remains an open problem, even though these criteria are essential for their gender and/or species identification. However, microfiltration devices necessitate physical membranes which complicate their fabrication, reduce the sample flow rate and can cause unwanted particle clogging. Recent advances in microfabrication such as electrode High Precision Capillary Printing allow to rapidly build electrode patterns over wide areas. In this study, we introduce a new concept of membrane-less dielectrophoretic (DEP) microfiltration suitable for large scale microfabrication processes. The proposed design involves two pairs of interdigitated electrodes at the top and the bottom of a microfluidic channel. We use finite-element calculations to analyse how the DEP force field throughout the channel, as well as the resulting trajectories of particles depend on the geometry of the system, on the physical properties of the particles and suspending medium and on the imposed voltage and flow rates. We numerically show that in the negative DEP regime, particles are focused in the channel mid-planes and that virtual pillars array leads either to their trapping at specific stagnation points, or to their focusing along specific lines, depending on their dielectrophoretic mobility. Simulations allow to understand how particles can be captured and to quantify the particle filtration conditions by introducing a critical dielectrophoretic mobility. We further illustrate the principle of membrane-less dielectrophoretic microfiltration using the proposed setup, by considering the separation of a binary mixture of polystyrene particles with different diameters, and validate it experimentally.</description>

      <title>Electrical Response of Nanofluidic Systems Subjected to Viscosity Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is expected that the introduction of a viscosity gradient across a nanofluidic system will drastically vary its current-voltage response, $i-V$. However, to date, there is no self-consistent theoretical model that can be used to fully characterize such a system. This work provides an internally self-consistent model that details all the key characteristics of ion transport through a nanofluidic system for an arbitrary viscosity field. In particular, this work addresses three separate issues. First, we provide a new expression for the Ohmic conductance, $g_{Ohmic} = i/V$. Second, several previous theoretical studies have suggested that the introduction of a viscosity gradient can result in the shift of the $i-V$ such that it does not cross the origin. This work unequivocally shows that the $i-V$ is expected to always cross the origin. Third, we demonstrate that even without electroosmotic flows, the introduction of a viscosity gradient results in current rectification. Importantly, all theoretical results are verified by non-approximated numerical simulations. This work provides the appropriate framework to analyze and interpret experimental and numerical simulations of nanofluidic systems subject to a viscosity gradient.</description>

      <title>Reflection Matrix Imaging for Wave Velocity Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Besides controlling wave trajectory inside complex media, wave velocity constitutes a relevant bio-marker for medical imaging. In a transmission configuration, wave-front distortions can be unscrambled to provide a map of the wave velocity landscape $c(\mathbf{r})$. However, most in-vivo applications correspond to a reflection configuration for which only back-scattered echoes generated by short-scale fluctuations of $c(\mathbf{r})$ can be harvested. Under a single scattering assumption, this speckle wave-field cannot provide the long-scale variations of $c(\mathbf{r})$. In this paper, we go beyond the first Born approximation and show how a map of $c(\mathbf{r})$ can be retrieved in epi-detection. To that aim, a reflection matrix approach of wave imaging is adopted. While standard reflection imaging methods generally rely on confocal focusing operations, matrix imaging consists in decoupling the location of the incident and received focal spots. Following this principle, a self-portrait of the focusing process can be obtained around each point of the medium. The Gouy phase shift exhibited by each focal spot is leveraged to finely monitor the wave velocity distribution $c(\mathbf{r})$ inside the medium. Experiment in a tissue-mimicking phantom and numerical simulations are first presented to validate our method. Speed-of-sound tomography is then applied to ultrasound data collected on the liver of a difficult-to-image patient. Beyond paving the way towards quantitative ultrasound, our approach can also be extremely rewarding for standard imaging. Indeed, each echo can be assigned to the actual position of a scatterer. It allows an absolute measurement of distance, an observable often used for diagnosis but generally extremely sensitive to wave velocity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Effects of Trailing Edge Thickness on NACA 4412 Airfoil Performance at Low Reynolds Numbers: A CFD Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the augmentation of the significance of wind energy, giving a high priority to the \text{airfoil's} efficiency enhancement is obligatory. To improve the performance of airfoils, many impressive techniques are already invented. In this article, the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil is modified by changing the thickness. CFD is used in this study, which aids in the identification of several important details. For our investigation, we choose the reliable Spalart Almaras model and the Reynolds number is 300k. Overall, the results demonstrate that using \(0.8\%\) thickness at the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil is viable to obtain the best output. The predominant reason is that not only the better coefficient of lift but also the preferable lift-to-drag \(\frac{C_L}{C_D}\) ratio is found in this configuration. However, using \(0.2\%\) thickness at the trailing edge reduces performance as a whole. So, it is recommended to utilize \(0.2\%\) thickness on the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Multifunctional Photonic Memory on a Foundry-Processed Photonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of computing with memory is essential for distributed, massively parallel, and adaptive architectures such as neural networks in artificial intelligence (AI). Accelerating AI can be achieved through photonic computing, but it requires nonvolatile photonic memory capable of rapid updates during on-chip training sessions or when new information becomes available during deployment. Phase-change materials (PCMs) are promising for providing compact, nonvolatile optical weighting; however, they face limitations in terms of bit precision, programming speed, and cycling endurance. Here, we propose a novel photonic memory cell that merges nonvolatile photonic weighting using PCMs with high-speed, volatile tuning enabled by an integrated PN junction. Our experiments demonstrate that the same PN modulator, fabricated via a foundry compatible process, can achieve dual functionality. It supports coarse programmability for setting initial optical weights and facilitates high-speed fine-tuning to adjust these weights dynamically. The result showcases a 400-fold increase in volatile tuning speed and a 10,000-fold enhancement in efficiency. This multifunctional photonic memory with volatile and nonvolatile capabilities could significantly advance the performance and versatility of photonic memory cells, providing robust solutions for dynamic computing environments.</description>

      <title>Periodic micromagnetic finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic micromagnetic finite element method (PM-FEM) is introduced to solve periodic unit cell problems using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. PM-FEM is applicable to general problems with 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities. PM-FEM is based on a non-periodic FEM-based micromagnetic solver and extends it in several aspects to account for periodicities, including the computation of exchange and magnetostatic fields. For the exchange field, PM-FEM modifies the sparse matrix construction for computing the Laplace operator to include additional elements arising due to the periodicities. For the magnetostatic field, the periodic extensions include modifications in the local operators, such as gradient, divergence, and surface magnetic charges as well as the long-range superposition operator for computing the periodic scalar potential. The local operators are extended to account for the periodicities similar to handling the Laplace operator. For the long-range superposition operator, PM-FEM utilizes a periodic Green's function (PGF) and fast spatial convolutions. The PGF is computed rapidly via exponentially rapidly convergent sums. The spatial convolutions are accomplished via a modified fast Fourier transform based adaptive integral method that allows calculating spatial convolutions with non-uniform meshes in $O(N\log N)$ numerical operations. PM-FEM is implemented on CPU and GPU based computer architectures. PM-FEM allows efficiently handling cases of structures contained withing the periodic unit cell touching or not touching its boundaries as well as structures that protrude beyond the unit cell boundaries. PM-FEM is demonstrated to have about the same or even higher performance than its parent non-periodic code. The demonstrated numerical examples show the efficiency of PM-FEM for highly complex structures with 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities.</description>

Abstract: The monograph summarizes the studies of the temperature limits for the existence of a supercooled liquid phase of the components of nanodisperse structures. Original in situ methods for studying supercooling during crystallization in nanodispersed systems are proposed. The results of long-term studies of the features of crystallization of particles on different substrates, or as part of layered film systems are presented. The influence of the interaction at the melt-substrate (matrix) interface, as well as the conditions of preparation of the samples on the values of the limiting supercooling are determined.</description>

      <title>Improvement of NACA6309 Airfoil with Passive Air-Flow Control by using Trailing Edge Flap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fossil fuel supplies can no longer be replenished and hence fossil fuel power generation becomes outdated, wind energy will become a vital solution to the impending energy crisis. A horizontal-axis wind turbine is a widely used technology that is highly dependent on the design of high-performing airfoils. In this paper, we have studied the performance of the NACA6309 airfoil and designed it by modifying the airfoil with a trailing edge plain flap. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations are utilized for this purpose. We have designed sixteen configurations of NACA 6309 airfoil by using plain flaps at the trailing edge and studied their aerodynamic performance. After comparing the lift, drag, and lift-to-drag ratios, it is evident that the \(1^\circ\) up-flap configuration generates the best output. In addition, the \(10^\circ\) down flap provides the worst performance among all configurations. Finally, pressure contours and velocity contours around the airfoils are presented, which describe the overall characteristics.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal frequency conversion in a multimode nonlinear system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has become the workhorse for countless applications in classical and quantum optics, from optical bistability to single photon pair generation. However, the intrinsic weakness of optical nonlinearity has meant that large input powers and weak output powers are often a necessity in nonlinear frequency conversion. Here, motivated by recent advances in using non-Hermitian photonics and gain/loss engineering to enable non-reciprocal light transport, we explore how the interplay between non-Hermiticity and optical nonlinearity leads to a fundamentally new regime of nonlinear frequency conversion. We show how non-Hermitian coupling between discrete frequency modes can result in non-reciprocal flow of energy in the frequency dimension, closely resembling the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Applying our theory to a multimode nonlinear cavity supporting cascaded nonlinear processes, we create an asymmetric infrared (IR) comb that features a ``skin'' frequency mode populated with efficiency exceeding 85\%. Furthermore, we demonstrate how three-wave mixing processes in the non-reciprocal infrared comb we generate enables terahertz (THz) generation exceeding the Manley-Rowe limit. We then show how the non-reciprocal frequency conversion is robust against cavity defects and disorder that cause random fluctuations in the dissipation rate for different modes. Moreover, in certain regimes, the nonlinear, non-Hermitian system supports stable limit cycles that can enable multimode pulsing with picosecond pulse widths and GHz repetition rates. Finally, we explore how the system can be applied to generate simultaneous IR and THz frequency combs, potentially unlocking novel applications in spectroscopy and metrology.</description>

      <title>Functional control of anomalous reflection via engineered metagratings without polarization limitations</title>

Abstract: Metagratings (MGs) have emerged as a promising platform for manipulating the anomalous propagation of electromagnetic waves. However, traditional methods for designing functional MG-based devices face significant challenges, including complex model structures, time-consuming optimization processes, and specific polarization requirements. In this work, we propose an inverse-design approach to engineer simple MG structures comprising periodic air grooves on a flat metal surface, which can control anomalous reflection without polarization limitations. Through rigorous analytical methods, we derive solutions that achieve perfect retroreflection and perfect specular reflection, thereby leading to functional control over the linearly-polarized electromagnetic waves. Such capabilities enable intriguing functionalities including polarization-dependent retroreflection and polarization-independent retroreflection, as confirmed through full-wave simulations. Our work offers a simple and effective method to control freely electromagnetic waves, with potential applications spanning wavefront engineering, polarization splitting, cloaking technologies, and remote sensing.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>p-(001)NiO/n-(0001)ZnO Heterostructures based Ultraviolet Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of epitaxial (001)p-NiO/(0001)n-ZnO heterostructures grown on (0001)sapphire substrates by pulsed laser deposition technique for ultraviolet photodetector application. Our study reveals that in the self-powered mode, these devices can serve as effective photodetectors for the UV-A band (320-400 nm) with response time as short as 400 microseconds. Peak responsivity as high as 5mA/W at zero bias condition have been achieved. These devices also show a very high level of stability under repeated on/off illumination cycles over a long period of time. Furthermore, we find that the response time of these detectors can be controlled from several microseconds to thousands of seconds by applying bias both in the forward and the reverse directions. This persistent photoconductivity effect has been explained in terms of the field induced change in the capture barrier height associated with certain traps located at the junction.</description>

      <title>Temperature shift of magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence features of nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently significant attention has been paid to magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence (PL) features of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. These features are used for microwave-free sensing and are indicative of the spin-bath properties in the diamond sample. Examinating the temperature dependence of the PL features allows to identify both temperature dependent and independent features, and to utilize them in diamond-based quantum sensing and dynamic nuclear polarization applications. Here, we study the thermal variability of many different features visible in a wide range of magnetic fields. To this end, we first discuss the origin of the features and tentatively assign the previously unidentified features to cross relaxation of NV center containing multi-spin systems. The experimental results are compared with theoretically predicted temperature shifts deduced from a combination of thermal expansion and electron-phonon interactions. A deeper insight into the thermal behavior of a wide array of the features may come with important consequences for various applications in high-precision NV thermometry, gyroscopes, solid-state clocks, and biomagnetic measurements.</description>
