      <title>The associative-poset point of view on right regular bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two results on the relation between the class of right regular bands (RRBs) and their underlying *associative posets*. The first one is a construction of a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that takes an RRB $(P,\cdot)$ to the corresponding $(P,\leq)$. The construction of such a left adjoint is actually done in general for any class of relational structures $(X,R)$ obtained from a variety, where $R$ is defined by a finite conjunction of identities. The second result generalizes the "inner" representations of direct product decompositions of semilattices studied by the second author to RRBs having at least one commuting element.</description>

      <title>Lie rings in finite-dimensional theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Lie rings definable in a finite-dimensional theory, extending the results for the finite Morley rank case. In particular, we prove a classification of Lie rings of dimension up to four in the NIP or connected case. In characteristic $0$, we verify a version of the Cherlin-Zilber Conjecture. Moreover, we characterize the actions of some classes, namely abelian, nilpotent and soluble, of Lie rings of finite dimension. Finally, we show the existence of definable envelopes for nilpotent and soluble Lie rings. These results are used to verify that the Fitting and the Radical ideal of a Lie ring of finite dimension are both definable and respectively nilpotent and soluble.</description>

      <title>Notions of rank and independence in countably categorical theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $\omega$-categorical theory $T$ and model $\mathcal{M}$ of $T$ we define a hierarchy of ranks, the $n$-ranks for $n &lt; \omega$ which only care about imaginary elements ``up to level $n$'', where level $n$ contains every element of $M$ and every imaginary element that is an equivalence class of an $\emptyset$-definable equivalence relation on $n$-tuples of elements from $M$. Using the $n$-rank we define the notion of $n$-independence. For all $n &lt; \omega$, the $n$-independence relation restricted to $M_n$ has all properties of an independence relation according to Kim and Pillay with the {\em possible exception} of the symmetry property. We prove that, given any $n &lt; \omega$, if $\mathcal{M} \models T$ and the algebraic closure in $\mathcal{M}^{\mathrm{eq}}$ restricted to imaginary elements ``up to level $n$'' which have $n$-rank 1 (over some set of parameters) satisfies the exchange property, then $n$-independence is symmetric and hence an independence relation when restricted to $M_n$. Then we show that if $n$-independence is symmetric for all $n &lt; \omega$, then $T$ is rosy. An application of this is that if $T$ has weak elimination of imaginaries and the algebraic closure in $\mathcal{M}$ restricted to elements of $M$ of 0-rank 1 (over some set of parameters from $M^{\mathrm{eq}}$) satisfies the exchange property, then $T$ is superrosy with finite U-thorn-rank.</description>

      <title>Structures of uninorms on bounded lattices via t-conorms, closure operators and t-subnorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide some structures of uninorms on bounded lattices via t-conorms, closure operators and t-subnorms, subject to certain constraints on the closure operators and t-subnorms. Importantly, these constraints are shown to be both sufficient and necessary. That is, the proposed methods reveal clear relationships between the structure of the resulting uninorms and the properties of the underlying components. Meanwhile, we present the degenerate cases of the aforementioned results, which are constructed using special closure operators and t-subnorms. Some of these cases correspond to well-known results documented in the literature. Moreover, the dual constructions of uninorms on bounded lattices, based on t-norms, interior operators and t-superconorms, are presented simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: A wide Aronszajn tree is a tree of size $\aleph_1$ with no uncountable branches. Assuming the consistency of the existence of a weakly compact cardinal, we show the consistency of the existence of a wide Aronszajn tree that is \textit{universal} in the sense that it contains an isomorphic copy of every wide Aronszajn tree.</description>

      <title>A new representation of finite Hoops using a new type of product of structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a new type of products hoops can be defined which, in the case of finite hoops, can describe an arbitrary hoop $\mathbf A$ as the product of its arbitrary filter $F$ and the corresponding homomorphic image $\mathbf A/F$. Moreover, this product satisfies a certain kind of associativity, and as a consequence we show that every finite hoop is in this sense a product of finite MV-chains.</description>

      <title>Abstract independence relations in neostability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework, in the style of Adler, for interpreting the notion of "witnessing" that has appeared (usually as a variant of Kim's Lemma) in different areas of neostability theory as a binary relation between abstract independence relations. This involves extending the relativisations of Kim-independence and Conant-independence due to Mutchnik to arbitrary independence relations.
  After developing this framework, we show that several results from simplicity, $\text{NTP}_2$, $\text{NSOP}_1$, and beyond follow as instances of general theorems for abstract independence relations. In particular, we prove the equivalence between witnessing and symmetry and the implications from this notion to chain local character and the weak independence theorem, and recover some partial converses. Finally, we use this framework to prove a dichotomy between $\text{NSOP}_1$ and Kruckman and Ramsey's $\text{BTP}$ that applies to most known $\text{NSOP}_4$ examples in the literature.</description>

      <title>Eventual Capture on a Measurable Cardinal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study from \cite{BrendleFreidmanMontoya, vandervlugtlocalizationcardinals} of localization cardinals $\mfb_\kappa(\in^*)$ and $\mfd_\kappa(\in^*)$ and their variants at regular uncountable $\kappa$. We prove that if $\kappa$ is measurable then these cardinals trivialize. We also provide other fundamental restrictions in the most general setting. We prove the results are optimal by forcing different values for $\mathfrak{b}_{\id^+}(\in^*),\mathfrak{d}_{\id^{++}}(\in^*)$ at a measurable. As a by-product, we prove the consistency of $\mfb_h(\in^*) &lt; \mfb_{h'}(\in^*)$ for functions $h, h' \in \kk$, thus answering a question of Brendle, Brooke-Taylor, Friedman and Montoya. Moreover, we study the relation between these cardinals and other well-known cardinal invariants.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Abstraction of the Localic Sheafification via the Tripos-to-Topos Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localic and realizability toposes are two central classes of toposes in categorical logic, both arising through the Hyland-Johnstone-Pitts tripos-to-topos construction. We investigate their shared geometric features by providing an algebraic abstraction of the notions of localic presheaves, sheafification and their connection to supercompactification of a locale via an instance of the Comparison Lemma. This can be applied to a broad class of toposes obtained to the tripos-to-topos constructions, including all those generated from a tripos based on the classical category of ZFC-sets. These results provide a unified geometric framework for understanding localic and realizability toposes.</description>

      <title>Measuring the complexity of characterizing $[0, 1]$, $S^1$, and $\mathbb{R}$ up to homeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In analogy to the study of Scott rank/complexity of countable structures, we initiate the study of the Wadge degrees of the set of homeomorphic copies of topological spaces. One can view our results as saying that the classical characterizations of $[0,1]$ (e.g., as the unique continuum with exactly two non-cut points, and other similar characterizations), appropriated expressed, are the simplest possible characterizations of $[0,1]$. Formally, we show that the set of homeomorphic copies of $[0,1]$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete. We also show that the set of homeomorphic copies of $S^1$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete. On the other hand, we show that the set of homeomorphic copies of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1$-Wadge-complete. It is the local compactness that cannot be expressed in a Borel way; the set of homeomorphic copies of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete within the locally compact spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Various Translations between Classical, Intuitionistic and Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several different proof translations exist between classical and intuitionistic logic (negative translations), and intuitionistic and linear logic (Girard translations). Our aims in this paper are (1) to consider extensions of intuitionistic linear logic which correspond to each of these systems, and (2) with this common logical basis, to develop a uniform approach to devising and simplifying proof translations. As we shall see, through this process of ``simplification'' we obtain most of the well-known translations in the literature.</description>

      <title>A comparison of three kinds of monotonic proof-theoretic semantics and the base-incompleteness of intuitionistic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I deal with two approaches to proof-theoretic semantics: one based on argument structures and justifications, which I call reducibility semantics, and one based on consequence among (sets of) formulas over atomic bases, called base semantics. The latter splits in turn into a standard reading, and a variant of it put forward by Sandqvist. I prove some results which, when suitable conditions are met, permit one to shift from one approach to the other, and I draw some of the consequences of these results relative to the issue of completeness of (recursive) logical systems with respect to proof-theoretic notions of validity. This will lead me to focus on a notion of base-completeness, which I will discuss with reference to known completeness results for intuitionistic logic. The general interest of the proposed approach stems from the fact that reducibility semantics can be understood as a labelling of base semantics with proof-objects typed on (sets of) formulas for which a base semantics consequence relation holds, and which witness this very fact. Vice versa, base semantics can be understood as a type-abstraction of a reducibility semantics consequence relation obtained by removing the witness of the fact that this relation holds, and by just focusing on the input and output type of the relevant proof-object.</description>

      <title>Comparing and Contrasting Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06589v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incomputability results in Formal Logic and the Theory of Computation (i.e., incompleteness and undecidability) have deep implications for the foundations of mathematics and computer science. Likewise, Social Choice Theory, a branch of Welfare Economics, contains various impossibility results that place limits on the potential fairness, rationality and consistency of social decision-making processes. However, a relationship between the fields' most seminal results: G\"odel's First Incompleteness Theorem of Formal Logic, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in Social Choice Theory is lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a general mathematical object called a Self-Reference System. Correspondences between the two theorems are formalised by abstracting well-known diagonalisation and fixed-point arguments, and consistency and completeness properties of provability predicates in the language of Self-Reference Systems. Nevertheless, we show that the mechanisms generating Arrovian impossibility and G\"odelian incompleteness have subtle differences.</description>

Abstract: We show that the class of Kalmar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder, and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. We also prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal. Furthermore, we discuss alternative substitution bases under arity constraints.</description>

      <title>T-Convexity, Tame Extensions and Definability of Hausdorff Limits in O-minimal Structures with Generic Derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the combination of two o-minimal extensions of the theory of real closed fields: one by a T-convex subring and the other by a T-derivation. Let T be a complete, model complete o-minimal extension of RCF. We show that the combined theory T_convex^delta has a model completion T_g,convex^delta. By adding a definable unary function st, we obtain a relative quantifier elimination result for tame pairs (M, delta^M, st^M, N, delta^N, st^N), where st is the standard part map and N is Dedekind complete in M. As an application, we prove the stable embedding property for tame pairs of T_g^delta. We also associate a sequence of definable metric topologies with models of T_g^delta and prove the Marker-Steinhorn Theorem for T_g^delta. As a consequence, Hausdorff limits of definable families are definable. A special case of our framework recovers Borotta's results on CODF with convex valuation subrings and tame pairs.</description>

      <title>Martin's Conjecture in the Enumeration Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Martin's Conjecture states that every definable function on the Turing degrees is either constant or increasing, and that every increasing function is an iterate of the Turing jump. This classification has already been corroborated for the class of uniformly invariant functions and a long-standing conjecture by Steel is that every definable function on the Turing degrees is equivalent to a uniformly invariant one. We explore whether a similar classification is possible in the enumeration degrees, an extension of the Turing degrees. We show that the spectrum of behavior is much wider in the enumeration degrees, even for uniformly invariant functions. However, our main result is that uniformly invariant functions behave locally as nicely as possible: they are constant, increasing, or above the skip operator. As a consequence, we show that there is a definable function in the enumeration degrees that is not equivalent to a uniformly invariant one on any cone.</description>

      <title>Quite free p-groups with trivial duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a class of abelian groups that exhibit a high degree of freeness while possessing no non-trivial homomorphisms to a canonical free object. Unlike prior investigations, which primarily focused on torsion-free groups, our work broadens the scope to include groups with torsion. Our main focus is on p-groups, for which we formulate and prove the Trivial Duality Conjecture. Key tools in our analysis include the multi black box method and the application of specific homological properties of relative trees.</description>
