      <title>TAXI: Traveling Salesman Problem Accelerator with X-bar-based Ising Macros Powered by SOT-MRAMs and Hierarchical Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising solvers with hierarchical clustering have shown promise for large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs), in terms of latency and energy. However, most of these methods still face unacceptable quality degradation as the problem size increases beyond a certain extent. Additionally, their hardware-agnostic adoptions limit their ability to fully exploit available hardware resources. In this work, we introduce TAXI -- an in-memory computing-based TSP accelerator with crossbar(Xbar)-based Ising macros. Each macro independently solves a TSP sub-problem, obtained by hierarchical clustering, without the need for any off-macro data movement, leading to massive parallelism. Within the macro, Spin-Orbit-Torque (SOT) devices serve as compact energy-efficient random number generators enabling rapid "natural annealing". By leveraging hardware-algorithm co-design, TAXI offers improvements in solution quality, speed, and energy-efficiency on TSPs up to 85,900 cities (the largest TSPLIB instance). TAXI produces solutions that are only 22% and 20% longer than the Concorde solver's exact solution on 33,810 and 85,900 city TSPs, respectively. TAXI outperforms a current state-of-the-art clustering-based Ising solver, being 8x faster on average across 20 benchmark problems from TSPLib.</description>

      <title>Memristive chaotic circuit for information processing through time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human brain processes sensory information in real-time with extraordinary efficiency compared to the possibilities of current artificial computing systems. It operates as a complex nonlinear system, composed of interacting dynamic units - neurons and synapses - that processes data-streams as time goes by, i.e. through time, using time as an internal self-standing variable. Here we report on a memristor-based compact chaotic circuit included in a computing architecture that can process information through time. We realized a hardware memristive version of the formally simplest chaotic circuit that, thanks to the nonlinearity of the nonvolatile memristor device, evolves with complex dynamics in response to a driving signal. The circuit is used in a single-node reservoir computing scheme to demonstrate nonlinear classification tasks and the processing of data streams through time. These results demonstrate that a simple memristor-based chaotic circuit has the potential to operate as a nonlinear dynamics-based computing system and to process temporal information through time.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Minor-Embedding Problem in Quantum Annealing and Evaluating State-of-the-Art Algorithm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique, assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Neural Ganglion Sensors: Learning Task-specific Event Cameras Inspired by the Neural Circuit of the Human Retina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the data-efficient spiking mechanism of neurons in the human eye, event cameras were created to achieve high temporal resolution with minimal power and bandwidth requirements by emitting asynchronous, per-pixel intensity changes rather than conventional fixed-frame rate images. Unlike retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the human eye, however, which integrate signals from multiple photoreceptors within a receptive field to extract spatio-temporal features, conventional event cameras do not leverage local spatial context when deciding which events to fire. Moreover, the eye contains around 20 different kinds of RGCs operating in parallel, each attuned to different features or conditions. Inspired by this biological design, we introduce Neural Ganglion Sensors, an extension of traditional event cameras that learns task-specific spatio-temporal retinal kernels (i.e., RGC "events"). We evaluate our design on two challenging tasks: video interpolation and optical flow. Our results demonstrate that our biologically inspired sensing improves performance relative to conventional event cameras while reducing overall event bandwidth. These findings highlight the promise of RGC-inspired event sensors for edge devices and other low-power, real-time applications requiring efficient, high-resolution visual streams.</description>
