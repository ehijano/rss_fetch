      <title>Temperature-dependent radiative lifetime measurement of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of sodium molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurement of radiative lifetimes of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of gas-phase molecular sodium using a high-resolution double-resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were done using a time-correlated photon counting technique at various pressures and temperatures. Lifetimes were extracted from extrapolations to the zero buffer gas pressure, called Stern-Volmer plot, and the temperature-dependence of the radiative lifetimes were measured over a temperature range from 593 K to 653 K. Our result agrees well within the error limits with the theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological rate formulas for over-barrier ionization of hydrogen and helium atoms in strong constant electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic over-barrier ionization (OBI) of atoms in strong electric fields is studied, focussing on hydrogen and helium as concrete examples. Our goal is, on the one hand, to develop an intuitive physical picture behind established empirical formulas for the ionization rate. We show that the ionization rate in a near OBI regime can be modelled quantitatively by extending corresponding tunneling rates by the combined action of the Stark effect and a widened electron emission angle. On the other hand, we present analytical rate formulas in a far OBI regime which closely agree with available numerical data. In result, compact rate expressions describing OBI of hydrogen- and helium-like atoms in a broad range of applied field strengths are obtained.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Optical Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized light offers opportunities to probe symmetry-dependent properties of matter such as chirality and spin. Circular dichroism measurements typically require further intrinsic or extrinsic breaking of symmetry by e.g. enantiomeric excess, orientation, magnetic fields or direction-sensitive detectors. Here we introduce circular-dichroic attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by leveraging the angular momentum of two circular-polarized pulses, both pump and probe, in an isotropic medium, optically orienting the angular momentum of excited states on an attosecond timescale. We investigate a circular-dichroic measurement of the attosecond transient absorption of He Rydberg states. By limiting the allowed pathways via dipole selection rules for co- and counter-rotating circular polarized NIR and XUV pulses, different spectral reshapings of the XUV transient absorption due to the AC Stark effect are observed. Paired with time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation calculations, the results show the role of selection and propensity rules and open up new opportunities to study coupling pathways of excited states as well as spin-dependent dynamics in atoms and beyond via attosecond optical orientation.</description>

      <title>A large momentum transfer atom interferometer without $k$-reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an atom interferometer using large momentum transfer without $k$-reversal. More specifically, we use a microwave $\pi$/2 pulse to manipulate the spin state of $^{87}$Rb atoms before applying a Raman light $\pi$ pulse to achieve 4$\hbar k$ momentum transfer per Raman light pulse. A microwave $\pi$ pulse in the middle of the interferometer sequence reverses the spin states, which allows closing of the interferometer arms by the same Raman light $\pi$ pulses without $k$-reversal. We discuss the scalability of this large momentum transfer technique. Our results extend the scope of using large momentum transfer atom optics into atom interferometers where $k$-reversal optics are not available.</description>

      <title>Observation of transition radiation carrying orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted photons carrying orbital angular momentum, which have potential applications spanning diverse fields, have been extensively studied since the theoretical work of Allen \textit{et al}. in 1992. Various methods for direct producing twisted photons have been explored, leveraging the rotational (spiral) motion of relativistic electrons in phenomena such as undulator radiation. In the present study, transition radiation carrying orbital angular momentum is observed for the first time. This radiation was generated by 220 MeV electrons incident on an Au-coated Si wafer. The orbital angular momentum was measured by analyzing the diffraction patterns produced as the radiation passed through a triangular aperture and a double slit. These results demonstrate that twisted photons can also be generated through the interaction of rectilinearly moving electrons with a solid target.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of a low-temperature normal Fermi gas with contact interactions: an exact perturbative expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity. The inclusion of the correction linear in $k_{\rm F}a$ greatly improves the agreement with the recent measurement of the viscosity by the Yale group.</description>

      <title>Absolute frequency measurement of the 171Yb optical lattice clock at KRISS using TAI for over a year</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a measurement of the absolute frequency of the 1S0-3P0 transition in the 171Yb optical lattice clock at KRISS (KRISS-Yb1) for 14 months, which was referenced to the SI second by primary and secondary standards worldwide via TAI (International Atomic Time). The determined absolute frequency is 518 295 836 590 863.75(14) Hz with the relative frequency uncertainty of 2.6x10^-16, which agrees well with other reports. This result is expected to contribute to the future update of the CIPM recommendation frequency of the secondary frequency standards.</description>

      <title>Zero- to Ultralow-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) is an NMR modality where experiments are performed in fields at which spin-spin interactions within molecules and materials are stronger than Zeeman interactions. This typically occurs at external fields of microtesla strength or below, considerably smaller than Earth's field. In ZULF NMR, the measurement of spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive means for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting sample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong external magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up new capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to the preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging. Furthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio band, the nuclear spins can be manipulated with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and highly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to high-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive materials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not lead to resonance line broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible. Notable practical advantages of ZULF NMR spectroscopy are the low cost and relative simplicity and portability of the spectrometer system. In recent years ZULF NMR has become more accessible, thanks to improvements in magnetometer sensitivity and their commercial availability, and the development of hyperpolarization methods that provide a simple means to boost signal strengths by several orders of magnitude. These topics are reviewed and a perspective on potential future avenues of ZULF-NMR research is presented.</description>
