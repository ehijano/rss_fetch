      <title>Physics-informed Diffusion Models for Multi-scale Prediction of Reference Signal Received Power in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) is a crucial factor that determines communication performance in mobile networks. Accurately predicting the RSRP can help network operators perceive user experiences and maximize throughput by optimizing wireless resources. However, existing research into RSRP prediction has limitations in accuracy and verisimilitude. Theoretical derivations and existing data-driven methods consider only easily quantifiable Large-Scale (LS) information, and struggle to effectively capture the intertwined LS and Small-Scale (SS) signal attenuation characteristics of the wireless channel. Moreover, the lack of prior physical knowledge leads to weak accuracy, interpretability, and transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel RSRP prediction framework, Channel-Diff. This framework physically models LS and SS attenuation using multimodal conditions and employs physics-informed conditional diffusion models as the prediction network. Channel-Diff extracts prior physical information that characterises the signal propagation process from network parameters and multi-attribute maps of the urban spatial environment. It provides LS physical priors through large-scale propagation modelling and shadow-occlusion modelling, and SS physical priors through multipath propagation modelling and urban microenvironment feature extraction. We design a physical-prior-guided two-stage training scheme with a noise prior guidance mechanism, enabling effective fusion of multi-scale physical knowledge with the diffusion models. Evaluations demonstrate Channel-Diff exhibits excellent performance on RSRP prediction, achieving at least 25.15%-37.19% improvement in accuracy relative to baseline methods. Additionally, the model also demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of transferability and training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multiconnectivity for SAGIN: Current Trends, Challenges, AI-driven Solutions, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN)-enabled multiconnectivity (MC) is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation networks, enabling users to simultaneously utilize multiple links across multi-layer non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and multi-radio access technology (multi-RAT) terrestrial networks (TN). However, the heterogeneity of TN and NTN introduces complex architectural challenges that complicate MC implementation. Specifically, the diversity of link types, spanning air-to-air, air-to-space, space-to-space, space-to-ground, and ground-to-ground communications, renders optimal resource allocation highly complex. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have shown remarkable effectiveness in optimal decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we review the current developments in SAGIN-enabled MC and outline the key challenges associated with its implementation. We further highlight the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches for resource optimization in a heterogeneous SAGIN environment. To this end, we present a case study on resource allocation optimization enabled by agentic RL for SAGIN-enabled MC involving diverse radio access technologies (RATs). Results show that learning-based methods can effectively handle complex scenarios and substantially enhance network performance in terms of latency and capacity while incurring a moderate increase in power consumption as an acceptable tradeoff. Finally, open research problems and future directions are presented to realize efficient SAGIN-enabled MC.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning-Based Handover Management in NextG O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditional handovers (THOs) have served as a backbone for mobile connectivity, they increasingly suffer from failures and delays, especially in dense deployments and high-frequency bands. To address these limitations, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handovers (CHOs) that enable proactive cell reservations and user-driven execution. However, both handover (HO) types present intricate trade-offs in signaling, resource usage, and reliability. This paper presents unique, countrywide mobility management datasets from a top-tier mobile network operator (MNO) that offer fresh insights into these issues and call for adaptive and robust HO control in next-generation networks. Motivated by these findings, we propose CONTRA, a framework that, for the first time, jointly optimizes THOs and CHOs within the O-RAN architecture. We study two variants of CONTRA: one where users are a priori assigned to one of the HO types, reflecting distinct service or user-specific requirements, as well as a more dynamic formulation where the controller decides on-the-fly the HO type, based on system conditions and needs. To this end, it relies on a practical meta-learning algorithm that adapts to runtime observations and guarantees performance comparable to an oracle with perfect future information (universal no-regret). CONTRA is specifically designed for near-real-time deployment as an O-RAN xApp and aligns with the 6G goals of flexible and intelligent control. Extensive evaluations leveraging crowdsourced datasets show that CONTRA improves user throughput and reduces both THO and CHO switching costs, outperforming 3GPP-compliant and Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines in dynamic and real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Schwarz Information Criterion Aided Multi-Armed Bandit for Decentralized Resource Allocation in Dynamic LoRa Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a lightweight distributed learning method for transmission parameter selection in Long Range (LoRa) networks that can adapt to dynamic communication environments. In the proposed method, each LoRa End Device (ED) employs the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)1-tuned algorithm to select transmission parameters including channel, transmission power, and bandwidth. The transmission parameters are selected based on the acknowledgment (ACK) feedback returned from the gateway after each transmission and the corresponding transmission energy consumption. Hence, it enables devices to simultaneously optimize transmission success rate and energy efficiency in a fully distributed manner. However, although UCB1-tuned based method is effective under stationary conditions, it suffers from slow adaptation in dynamic environments due to its strong reliance on historical observations. To address this limitation, we integrate the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) to our proposed method. SIC is adopted because it enables low-cost detection of changes in the communication environment, making it suitable for implementation on resource-constrained LoRa EDs. When a change is detected by SIC, the learning history of UCB1-tuned is reset, allowing rapid re-learning under the new conditions. Experimental results using real LoRa devices demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior transmission success rate, energy efficiency, and adaptability compared with the conventional UCB1-tuned algorithm without SIC.</description>

      <title>Smart IoT-Based Leak Forecasting and Detection for Energy-Efficient Liquid Cooling in AI Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Resource Allocation for Geographically-Distributed Inference by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.</description>

      <title>A Queueing Theoretic Perspective on Low-Latency LLM Inference with Variable Token Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) propel the prosperity of interactive AI applications showcased by ChatGPT that demand timely response of inference services. However, LLM inference is computation intensive and memory intensive, and improper parameter configuration at LLM platforms may exacerbate the inference time. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LLM output token distribution on the inference queueing delay, where the max-token clipping and the batched inference are considered. By formulating an M/G/1 model, we observe that enforcing a maximum output token limit on a very small fraction of inference requests can significantly reduce the queueing delay, and our model facilitates the selection of the optimal limit. For the batch inference, we model the service process as a bulk queue in which the batch processing time is affected by the batch size and the maximum token size inside this batch jointly. The queueing delays of the batching of all buffered requests (dynamic batching), the batching of constant number of requests (fixed batching), and the batching without intra-batch waiting (elastic batching) are derived. Experimental results show that our mathematical models coincide with the event-driven simulations well.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol in Vehicular Opportunistic Networks: A Dynamic Cluster-based Routing Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) employ the Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) paradigm to maintain communication during intermittent connectivity. However, routing performance suffers due to dynamic topology changes, unpredictable contact patterns, and resource constraints including limited energy and buffer capacity. These challenges compromise delivery reliability, increase latency, and reduce node longevity in highly dynamic environments. This paper proposes Cluster-based Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning (CR-DRL), an adaptive routing approach that integrates an Actor-Critic learning framework with a heuristic function. CR-DRL enables real-time optimal relay selection and dynamic cluster overlap adjustment to maintain connectivity while minimizing redundant transmissions and enhancing routing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. CR-DRL extends node lifetimes by up to 21%, overall energy use is reduced by 17%, and nodes remain active for 15% longer. Communication performance also improves, with up to 10% higher delivery ratio, 28.5% lower delay, 7% higher throughput, and data requiring 30% fewer transmission steps across the network.</description>
