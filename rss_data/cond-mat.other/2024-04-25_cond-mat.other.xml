      <title>Neural network-based recognition of multiple nanobubbles in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning method for swiftly identifying nanobubbles in graphene, crucial for understanding electronic transport in graphene-based devices. Nanobubbles cause local strain, impacting graphene's transport properties. Traditional techniques like optical imaging are slow and limited for characterizing multiple nanobubbles. Our approach uses neural networks to analyze graphene's density of states, enabling rapid detection and characterization of nanobubbles from electronic transport data. This method swiftly enumerates nanobubbles and surpasses conventional imaging methods in efficiency and speed. It enhances quality assessment and optimization of graphene nanodevices, marking a significant advance in condensed matter physics and materials science. Our technique offers an efficient solution for probing the interplay between nanoscale features and electronic properties in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Purification phase transition in the central spin model: second R\'enyi entropy in dual space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical investigation of the dynamics of the central spin model in the presence of measurement processes. This model holds promise for experimental exploration due to its topology, which facilitates the natural distinction of a central particle and the quantum bath as different subsystems, allowing for the examination of entanglement phase transitions. To characterize the measurement-induced phase transition in this system, we employ a recently developed method based on second R\'enyi entropy in dual space. Our simulations account for decoherence, energy relaxation, and gate errors. We determine critical measurement rates and demonstrate that they significantly differ from those predicted by a simple approach based on mutual entropy.</description>

      <title>Bosonic and Fermionic Holographic Fluctuation and Dissipation at finite temperature and density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some general aspects of fluctuation and dissipation in the holographic scenario at zero and finite density. We model this situation with a probe string in a diagonal metric representing a black brane. The string stretches from the black brane to a probe brane thus simulating a stochastic driven particle. In this scenario, we compute the admittance, the diffusion coefficient, the correlation functions and the regularized mean square displacement, for bosons and fermions, all from the metric components. We check these calculations with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Further, we show that at finite temperature and density, the mean square displacement in the limit of short times reproduces the usual quadratic (ballistic) behavior, for bosons and fermions. For large times, we find ultraslow diffusive processes in various cases, except for bosons at zero chemical potential. We apply this general analysis in two different models: hyperscaling violation at finite temperature and a charged dilatonic AdS black hole, both for bosons and fermions. This is important because we found the fermionic diffusion in systems which allow the appearance of Fermi surfaces and Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>Zero mode-soliton duality and pKdV kinks in Boussinesq system for non-linear shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Boussinesq system for a non-linear shallow water is considered. The nonlinear and topological effects are examined through an associated matrix spectral problem. It is shown an equivalence relationship between the bound states and topological soliton charge densities which resembles a formula of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer-type index theorem. The zero mode components describe a topologically protected Kelvin wave of KdV-type and a novel Boussinesq-type field. We show that either the $1+1$ dimensional pKdV kink or the Kelvin mode can be mapped to the bulk velocity potential in $2+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of many-body non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that many-body fermionic non-Hermitian systems require two distinct sets of topological invariants to describe the topology of energy bands and quantum states respectively, with the latter yet to be explored. We identify 10 symmetry classes -- determined by particle-hole, linearized time-reversal, and linearized chiral symmetries. Each class has topological invariant associated with each dimension, dictating the topology of quantum states. These findings pave the way for deeper understanding of the topological phases of many-body non-Hermitian systems.</description>
