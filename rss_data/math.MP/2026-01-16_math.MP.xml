      <title>Shallow-KAN Based Solution of Moving Boundary PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) require significantly smaller architectures compared to multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based approaches, while retaining expressive power through spline-based activations. We propose a shallow KAN framework that directly approximates the temperature distribution T(x,t) and the moving interface $\Gamma(t)$, enforcing the governing PDEs, phase equilibrium, and Stefan condition through physics-informed residuals. To enhance accuracy, we employ interface-focused collocation resampling. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions show that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions of both temperature fields and interface dynamics, highlighting the potential of KANs as a compact and efficient alternative for moving boundary PDEs. First, we validate the model with semi-infinite analytical solutions. Subsequently, the model is extended to 2D using a level-set based formulation for interface propagation, which is solved within the KAN framework. This work demonstrates that KANs are capable of solving complex moving boundary problems without the need for measurement data.</description>

      <title>A note on invariants of mixed-state topological order in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of mixed-state topological order requires indices that behave monotonically under finite-depth quantum channels. In two dimensions, a braided $C^*$-tensor category, which corresponds to strong symmetry, arises from a state satisfying approximate Haag duality. In this note, we show that the $S$-matrix and topological twists of the braided $C^*$-tensor category are quantities that are monotone under finite-depth quantum channels.</description>

      <title>On Force Interactions for Electrodynamics-Like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework for premetric p-form electrodynamics is proposed. Independently of particular constitutive relations, the corresponding Maxwell equations are derived as a special case of stress theory in geometric continuum mechanics. Expressions for the potential energy of a charged region in spacetime, as well as expressions for the force and stress interactions on the region, are presented. The expression for the force distribution is obtained by computing the rate of change of the proposed potential energy under a virtual motion of the region. These expressions differ from those appearing in the standard references. The cases of electrostatics and magnetostatics in R^3 are presented as examples.</description>

      <title>Phase Space structure on Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I argue that the Hodge structure on a Euclidean Clifford algebra $Cl(n)$ provides a way to generalise K\"ahler structure to higher dimensions, in the sense that the paired variables are now associated with $k-$ and $(n-k)-$ dimensional subspaces rather than with vectors. This puts a phase space structure on Clifford algebras, and so allows us to construct a Hamiltonian dynamics on these multilinear variables. This construction shows that alternating pairs of subspaces obey commuting and anticommuting dynamics, hinting that this construction is indeed a natural one, with interesting new behaviour.</description>

      <title>Geometric characterization of frictional impacts by means of breakable kinetic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of geometric Impulsive Mechanics of systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, we model the roughness of a unilateral constraint ${\mathcal S\/}$ by introducing a suitable instantaneous kinetic constraint ${\mathcal B\/}\subset {\mathcal S\/}$. A constitutive characterization of ${\mathcal B\/}$ based only on the geometric properties of the setup and on the dry friction laws can then be introduced to model the frictional behavior of ${\mathcal S\/}$ in an impact of the system. Such a model restores determinism and avoids the analysis of frictional forces in the contact point, with all its associated theoretical problems of causality. Three examples of increasing complexity, showing a natural stick--slip behavior of the impact, are presented.</description>

      <title>Finite lattice kinetic equations for bosons, fermions, and discrete NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study finite lattice kinetic equations for bosons, fermions, and discrete NLS. For each model this closed evolution equation provides an approximate description for the evolution of the appropriate covariance function in the system. It is obtained by truncating the cumulant hierarchy and dropping the higher order cumulants in the usual manner. To have such a reference solution should simplify controlling the full hierarchy and thus allow estimating the error from the truncation. The harmonic part is given by nearest neighbour hopping, with arbitrary symmetric interaction potential of coupling strength $\lambda&gt;0$. We consider the well-posedness of the resulting evolution equation up to finite kinetic times on a finite but large enough lattice. We obtain decay of the solutions and upper bounds that are independent of $\lambda$ and depend on the lattice size only via some Sobolev type norms of the interaction potential and initial data. We prove that the solutions are not sensitive to how the energy conservation delta function is approximated.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time maximally superintegrable systems and deformed symmetry algebras: the Calogero-Moser case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the complete structure of the symmetry algebras associated with the N-body Calogero-Moser system and its maximally superintegrable discretization. We prove that the discretization naturally leads to a nontrivial deformation of the continuous symmetry algebra, with the discretization parameter playing the r\^ole of a deformation parameter. This phenomenon illustrates how discrete superintegrable systems can be viewed as natural sources of deformed polynomial algebraic structures. As a byproduct of these results, we also reveal a connection between the above-mentioned symmetry algebras and the Bell polynomials, as a consequence of the trace properties.</description>

      <title>Absorption and fixation times for evolutionary processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the absorption and fixation times for evolutionary processes on graphs, under different updating rules. While in Moran process a single neighbour is randomly chosen to be replaced, in proliferation processes other neighbours can be replaced using Bernoulli or binomial draws depending on $0 &lt; p \leq 1$. There is a critical value $p_c$ such that the proliferation is advantageous or disadvantageous in terms of fixation probability depending on whether $p &gt; p_c$ or $p &lt; p_c$.
  We clarify the role of symmetries for computing the fixation time in Moran process. We show that the Maruyama-Kimura symmetry depend on the graph structure induced in each state, implying asymmetry for all graphs except cliques and cycles. There is a fitness value, not necessarily $1$, beyond which the fixation time decreases monotonically.
  We apply Harris' graphical method to prove that the fixation time decreases monotonically depending on $p$. Thus there exists another value $p_t$ for which the proliferation is advantageous or disadvantageous in terms of time. However, at the critical level $p=p_c$, the proliferation is highly advantageous when $r \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Zero-Error List Decoding for Classical-Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the zero-error capacity of pure-state classical-quantum channels in the setting of list decoding. We provide an achievability bound for list-size two and a converse bound holding for every fixed list size. The two bounds coincide for channels whose pairwise absolute state overlaps form a positive semi-definite matrix. Finally, we discuss a remarkable peculiarity of the classical-quantum case: differently from the fully classical setting, the rate at which the sphere-packing bound diverges might not be achievable by zero-error list codes, even when we take the limit of fixed but arbitrarily large list size.</description>

      <title>Spectral projections of an anharmonic oscillator with complex polynomial potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a broad class of polynomial potentials $V$, with an important and instructive representative being $V(x) = x^{2a} + i x^b$, $x \in \mathbb R$, $a, b \in \mathbb N$, we show that the system of spectral projections $\{P_n\}_n$ of an anharmonic operator $L = - (\mathrm{d}/ \mathrm{d}x)^2 + V(x)$ does not generate a (Riesz) basis in $L^2(\mathbb R)$ if $a - 1 &lt; b &lt; 2a$. Moreover, for $\sigma = [b - (a - 1)]/(1 + a)$ and $\gamma &gt; 0$ small enough, $\limsup_n \|P_n\|/ \exp(\gamma n^\sigma) = \infty$. Proofs are based on two groups of results which are of great interest on their own: (a) relationship between behavior (growth) of the norms of projections $\|P_n\|$ and of the resolvent $\|(z - L)^{-1}\|$ outside of the spectrum $\sigma(L)$; (b) partial fraction decompositions of special meromorphic functions $1/F$ where $F(w) = \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( 1 + \frac{w}{a_k} \right)$, $a_{k+1} \geq a_k&gt;0$, $k \in \mathbb N$, and the generalization of the first resolvent identity.</description>

Abstract: A precise definition is proposed for the localization probability of a quantum state within a given subspace of the full Hilbert space of a quantum system. The corresponding localized component of the state is explicitly identified, and several mathematical properties are established. Applications and interpretations in the context of quantum information are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The formation of periodic three-body orbits for Newtonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braids are periodic solutions to the general N-body problem in gravitational dynamics. These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of ~9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo. If composed of compact objects, they potentially form interesting targets for gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>An efficient probabilistic scheme for the exit time probability of $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The {\alpha}-stable L\'evy process, commonly used to describe L\'evy flight, is characterized by discontinuous jumps and is widely used to model anomalous transport phenomena. In this study, we investigate the associated exit problem and propose a method to compute the exit time probability, which quantifies the likelihood that a trajectory starting from an initial condition exits a bounded region in phase space within a given time. This estimation plays a key role in understanding anomalous diffusion behavior. The proposed method approximates the {\alpha}-stable process by combining a Brownian motion with a compound Poisson process. The exit time probability is then modeled using a framework based on partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). The Feynman-Kac formula provides a probabilistic representation of the solution, involving conditional expectations over stochastic differential equations. These expectations are computed via tailored quadrature rules and interpolation techniques. The proposed method achieves first-order convergence in time and offers significant computational advantages over standard Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches. In particular, it avoids assembling and solving large dense linear systems, resulting in improved efficiency. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and performance through two numerical examples, highlighting its applicability to physical transport problems.</description>

      <title>Algebras of distributions suitable for phase-space quantum mechanics. II. Topologies on the Moyal algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of the Moyal $*$-algebra may be defined in three ways: the algebra may be regarded as an operator algebra over the space of smooth declining functions either on the configuration space or on the phase space itself; or one may construct the $*$-algebra via a filtration of Hilbert spaces (or other Banach spaces) of distributions. We prove the equivalence of the three topologies thereby obtained. As a consequence, by filtrating the space of tempered distributions by Banach subspaces, we give new sufficient conditions for a phase-space function to correspond to a trace-class operator via the Weyl correspondence rule.</description>

      <title>Analytic approach to boundary integrability with application to mixed-flux $AdS_3 \times S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary integrability provides rare analytic control over field theories in the presence of an interface, from quantum impurity problems to open string dynamics. We develop an analytic framework for integrable boundaries in two-dimensional sigma-models that determines admissible reflection maps directly from the meromorphic Lax connection. Applying it to open strings on $AdS_3\times S^3$ with mixed NSNS and RR flux, we find two branches of integrable boundary conditions. One branch admits D-branes wrapping twisted conjugacy classes on $SU(1,1)\times SU(2)$, with the mixed-flux deformation encoded entirely into dynamical boundary data. At the exactly solvable WZW point these coincide with the conformal D-branes, providing a natural link to conformal perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: For any infinite, connected, locally finite graph $G=(V,E)$, any parameter $p&gt;p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c}(G)$, and any (finite or infinite) set of vertices $S\subset V$, we derive explicit exponential-type upper bounds on the disconnection probability $\mathbb{P}_{p}(S\nleftrightarrow\infty)$. The estimates are expressed in terms of a packing profile of $S$, encoded by a $(p,\varepsilon,c)$--packing number, which counts how many well-separated vertices in $S$ exhibit controlled local-to-global connectivity. The proof combines a local functional characterization of $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c}$ from \cite{ZL24,ZL26} with a packing construction and an amplification-by-independence argument, in the direction of Problem~1.6 in \cite{DC20}.</description>

      <title>Planar Site Percolation, End Structure, and the Benjamini-Schramm Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, connected, locally finite planar graph and consider i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(p)$ site percolation. Write $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ and $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ for the critical and uniqueness thresholds. Using a well--separated Freudenthal embedding $G\hookrightarrow\mathbb S^2$, we introduce a cycle--separation equivalence on ends and associated ``directional'' thresholds $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$.
  When the set of end--equivalence classes is countable, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)=\inf_F p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$ and that for every $p\in\bigl(\tfrac12,\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$ there are almost surely infinitely many infinite open clusters. Combined with the $0/\infty$ theorem of Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for $p\le \tfrac12$, this yields non--uniqueness throughout the full coexistence interval $\bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G),\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$, and hence $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\ge 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ in this setting. This resolves the extension problem posed by Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for the upper half of the coexistence regime under a natural countability hypothesis.
  In contrast, for graphs with uncountably many end--equivalence classes we give criteria guaranteeing infinitely many infinite clusters above criticality, and we construct an explicit locally finite planar graph of minimum degree at least $7$ for which $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)&lt;1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$. Consequently, the Benjamini--Schramm conjecture (Conjecture 7 in \cite{bs96}) that planarity together with minimal vertex degree at least 7 forces infinitely many infinite clusters for all $p\in(p_c,1-p_c)$ does not hold in full generality.
  Our proofs combine a cutset characterization of $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}$ with a planar alternating--arm exploration organized by an end--adapted boundary decomposition.</description>

      <title>M\"obius-Type Structures in Non-Orientable Singular Semi-Riemannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our objective is to illuminate the global structure of non-orientable manifolds with signature-changing metrics. Using explicit constructions based on the topology of the M\"{o}bius strip, we produce examples of crosscap manifolds where the gluing junction serves as the locus of signature change. In another set of examples, we convert the M\"{o}bius strip into a singular signature-type changing manifold. For these resulting manifolds, we test whether the metric can be expressed as $\tilde{g}=g+fV^{\flat}\otimes V^{\flat}$, with $g$ a Lorentzian metric and $f$ a smooth interpolation function between the Lorentzian and Riemannian regions, separated by the signature change hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$. Our analysis reveals that the radical of the metric can transition from transverse to tangent at $\mathcal{H}$, pseudo-space orientability is obstructed by the Euler characteristic, and pseudo-time orientability may still hold. These examples illustrate subtle obstructions to applying standard transformation prescriptions for signature change and highlight novel phenomena in compact, non-orientable semi-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a rigidity result for compact three-dimensional Heterotic solitons with parallel non-trivial torsion. We show that they are either hyperbolic three-manifolds or compact quotients of the Heisenberg group equipped with a left-invariant metric. In particular, the latter arise both as solitons with completely skew-symmetric torsion as well as with non-vanishing twistorial component. As a corollary, we obtain the universal bound $-24$ for the scalar curvature of Heterotic solitons with parallel skew-symmetric torsion, which prevents it from being arbitrarily large.</description>

Abstract: We study finite-rank normal deformations of rotationally invariant non-Hermitian random matrices. Extending the classical Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) framework, we characterize the emergence and fluctuations of outlier eigenvalues in models of the form $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{T}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a large rotationally invariant non-Hermitian random matrix and $\mathbf{T}$ is a finite-rank normal perturbation. We also describe the corresponding eigenvector behavior. Our results provide a unified framework encompassing both Hermitian and non-Hermitian settings, thereby generalizing several known cases.</description>

      <title>H-EFT-VA: An Effective-Field-Theory Variational Ansatz with Provable Barren Plateau Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are critically threatened by the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT). By enforcing a hierarchical "UV-cutoff" on initialization, we theoretically restrict the circuit's state exploration, preventing the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs. We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\partial \theta] \in \Omega(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p &lt; 10^{-88}$.</description>

      <title>Twisted Cherednik spectrum as a $q,t$-deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik operators can be first analyzed in the limit of $q\longrightarrow 1$. Then, the polynomial eigenfunctions form a simple set originating from the symmetric ground state of non-vanishing degree and excitations over it, described by non-symmetric polynomials of higher degrees and enumerated by weak compositions. This pattern is inherited by the full spectrum at $q\neq 1$, which can be considered as a deformation. The whole story looks like a typical NP problem: the Cherednik equations are difficult to solve, but easy to check the solution once it is somehow found.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, under the H\"ormander criterion on an It\^{o} process, all its martingale observables are smooth. As a consequence, we also obtain a generalized Feynman-Kac formula providing smooth solutions to certain PDE boundary-value problems, while allowing for degenerate diffusions as well as boundary stopping (under very mild boundary regularity assumptions). We also highlight an application to a question posed on Schramm-Loewner evolutions, by making certain Girsanov transform martingales accessible via It\^{o} calculus.</description>

      <title>Vertex operator algebra bundles on modular curves and their associated modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the vector bundle on the elliptic modular curve that is associated to a vertex operator algebra $V$ (VOA) or more generally a quasi-vertex operator algebra (QVOA), with a view towards future applications aimed at studying the characters of VOAs. We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator. We introduce an associated lowering operator $\Lambda$ on $Q(V)$ having the property that the $V$-valued modular forms $M(V)\subseteq Q(V)$ are the kernel of $\Lambda$. This extends the classical theory of scalar-valued quasi-modular forms. We exhibit an explicit isomorphism of $M(V)$ with $M \otimes V$. Finally, the coordinate invariance of vertex operators implies that $M(V)$ has a natural Hecke theory, and we use this isomorphism to fully describe the Hecke eigensystems: they are the same as the systems of eigenvalues that arise from scalar-valued quasi-modular forms.</description>

      <title>Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, wave propagation in structured media with quasiperiodic patterns is investigated. We propose a methodology based on Sturmian sequences for the generation of structured mechanical systems from a given parameter. The approach is presented in a general form so that it can be applied to waveguides of different nature, as long as they can be modeled with the transfer matrix method. The bulk spectrum is obtained and its fractal nature analyzed. For validation of the theoretical results, three numerical examples are presented. The obtained bulk spectra show different shapes for the studied examples, but they share features which can be explained from the proposed theoretical setting.</description>

      <title>On the characteristic form of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued zero-curvature representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathfrak{g}$-valued zero-curvature representations (ZCRs) for partial differential equations in two independent variables from the perspective of their extension to the entire infinite jet space, focusing on their characteristic elements. Since conservation laws -- more precisely, conserved currents -- and their generating functions for a given equation are precisely the $\mathbb{R}$-valued ZCRs and their characteristic elements, a natural question arises: to what extent can results known for conservation laws be extended to general $\mathfrak{g}$-valued ZCRs.
  For a fixed matrix Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{gl}(n)$, we formulate ZCRs as equivalence classes of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued function pairs on the infinite jet space that satisfy the Maurer--Cartan condition. Our main result establishes that every such ZCR admits a characteristic representative -- i.e., a representative in which the Maurer--Cartan condition takes a characteristic form -- generalizing the characteristic form known for conservation laws. This form is preserved under gauge transformations and can thus be regarded as a kind of normal form for ZCRs. We derive a new necessary condition, independent of the Maurer--Cartan equation, that must be satisfied by any characteristic representative. This condition is trivial in the abelian case but nontrivial whenever $\mathfrak{g}$ is nonabelian. These findings not only confirm structural assumptions used in previous works but also suggest potential applications in the classification and computation of ZCRs.</description>

      <title>A Non-Renormalization Theorem for Local Functionals in Ghost-Free Vector Field Theories Coupled to Dynamical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a non-renormalization theorem for a class of ghost-free local functionals describing massive vector field theories coupled to dynamical geometry. Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders.</description>

Abstract: For the Schr\"odinger equation with a general interaction term, which may be linear or nonlinear, time dependent and including charge transfer potentials, we prove the global solutions are asymptotically given by the sum of a free wave and a weakly localized part. The proof is based on constructing in a new way the Free Channel Wave Operator, and further tools from the recent works \cite{Liu-Sof1,Liu-Sof2,SW2020}. This work generalizes the results of the first part of \cite{Liu-Sof1,Liu-Sof2} to arbitrary dimension, and non-radial data.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed semi-discrete finite element approximations of the Stochastic linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by additive Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and derive an error estimate with respect to the discretization parameter of the finite element approximation. Numerical experiments have also been performed to support theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the codimension-one nonlinear asymptotic stability of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family of black holes in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-neutral scalar field model, up to and including the event horizon. More precisely, we show that there exists a teleologically defined, codimension-one "submanifold" $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ of the moduli space of spherically symmetric characteristic data for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system lying close to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family, such that any data in $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ evolve into a solution with the following properties as time goes to infinity: (i) the metric decays to a member of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family uniformly up to the event horizon, (ii) the scalar field decays to zero pointwise and in an appropriate energy norm, (iii) the first translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field is approximately constant on the event horizon $\mathcal H^+$, (iv) for "generic" data, the second translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field grows linearly along the event horizon. Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon. Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the "stability" of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated "Aretakis instability" for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model.</description>

      <title>Characterising memory in quantum channel discrimination via constrained separability problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories are a crucial precondition in many protocols for processing quantum information. A fundamental problem that illustrates this statement is given by the task of channel discrimination, in which an unknown channel drawn from a known random ensemble should be determined by applying it for a single time. In this paper, we characterise the quality of channel discrimination protocols when the quantum memory, quantified by the auxiliary dimension, is limited. This is achieved by formulating the problem in terms of separable quantum states with additional affine constraints that all of their factors in each separable decomposition obey. We discuss the computation of upper and lower bounds to the solutions of such problems which allow for new insights into the role of memory in channel discrimination. In addition to the single-copy scenario, this methodological insight allows to systematically characterise quantum and classical memories in adaptive channel discrimination protocols. Especially, our methods enabled us to identify channel discrimination scenarios where classical or quantum memory is required, and to identify the hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships within adaptive channel discrimination protocols.</description>

      <title>Rational RG flow, extension, and Witt class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. Encrypted cloning represents a new paradigm that provides a form of redundancy, parallelism or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem. For example, a possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure, aka causal spacetimes satisfying the ``no observer horizons'' condition. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometry group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>On a polygon version of Wiegmann-Zabrodin formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a convex polygon in ${\mathbb C}$ and let $\Delta_{D, P}$ be the operator of the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the Lapalcian $\Delta=-4\partial_z\partial_{\bar z}$ in $P$. We derive a variational formula for the logarithm of the $\zeta$-regularized determinant of $\Delta_{D, P}$ for arbitrary infinitesimal deformations of the polygon $P$ in the class of polygons (with the same number of vertices). For a simply connected domain with smooth boundary such a formula was recently discovered by Wiegmann and Zabrodin as a non obvious corollary of the Alvarez variational formula, for domains with corners this approach is unavailable (at least for those deformations that do not preserve the corner angles) and we have to develop another one.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</description>

      <title>Bosonization of Noise Effects in Nonlocal Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems that interact non-locally with an environment are paradigms for exploring collective phenomena. They naturally emerge in various physical contexts involving long-range, many-body interactions. We consider a general class of such open systems characterized by a coupling to the environment which is inversely proportional to the square root of the environment size. We show that the induced system dynamics has a universal bosonic nature: the same evolution arises from coupling the system to a collection of noninteracting bosonic modes, independently of the microscopic structure of the original environment. This emergent "bosonization" of the environment's influence results from the scaling of the coupling in the thermodynamic limit and is a manifestation of the quantum central limit theorem. While the effect has been observed in specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. This estimate is based on quantitative estimates on the remainder of the Weyl law with explicit constants, which we give a new proof without using Neumann eigenvalues. Our arguments in deriving such uniform estimates yield also, in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, classes of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture. Another key observation is that on strip-tiling domains (and therefore any triangles for instance) one actually has better eigenvalue estimates than P\'olya conjectured.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectral Framework for Aging, Heterogeneous, and Distributed Order Systems via Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While General Fractional Calculus has successfully expanded the scope of memory operators beyond power-laws, standard formulations remain predominantly restricted to the half-line via Riemann-Liouville or Caputo definitions. This constraint artificially truncates the system's history, limiting the thermodynamic consistency required for modeling processes on unbounded domains. To overcome these barriers, we construct the \textbf{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Framework}, a generalized formalism that extends non-local theory to the entire real line without history truncation.
  Unlike recent algebraic approaches based on conjugation for finite intervals, we develop a rigorous harmonic analysis framework. Our central contribution is the \textbf{Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem}, which establishes the Weighted Fourier Transform as a unitary diagonalization map for these operators. This result allows us to rigorously classify and solve distinct physical regimes under a single algebraic structure. We explicitly derive exact solutions for \textit{diffusive relaxation} (governed by Complete Bernstein Functions), \textit{inertial wave propagation} (exhibiting oscillatory dynamics), and \textit{retarded aging} (via distributed order), proving that our framework unifies the description of anomalous transport and wave mechanics in complex, time-deformed media.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Mechanism for Transient Anomalous Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon with critical applications in fields such as metallurgy, cell biology, and population dynamics. While standard diffusion is well-understood, anomalous diffusion often requires complex non-local models. This paper investigates a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusion coefficient is linearly dependent on concentration. We demonstrate through a perturbative analysis that this physically-grounded model exhibits transient anomalous diffusion. The system displays a clear crossover from an initial subdiffusive regime to standard Fickian behavior at long times. This result establishes an important mechanism for trasient anomalous diffusion that arises purely from local interactions, providing an intuitive alternative to models based on fractional calculus or non-local memory effects.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations in Two-Species Born--Infeld Theories Governing Vortices and Antivortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive several new Bogomol'nyi (self-dual) equations in two-species $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories governed by the Born--Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. By identifying appropriate Born--Infeld type Higgs potentials, we show that the highly nonlinear energy functionals admit exact topological lower bounds saturated by coupled first-order equations. The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings.
  Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges. These results provide a rare analytically solvable framework for studying thermodynamics in nonlinear multi-component gauge theories regulated by the Born--Infeld electrodynamics.</description>
