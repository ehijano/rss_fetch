      <title>QSTAformer: A Quantum-Enhanced Transformer for Robust Short-Term Voltage Stability Assessment against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation. While classical machine learning-based methods have demonstrated strong performance, they still face challenges in robustness under adversarial conditions. This paper proposes QSTAformer-a tailored quantum-enhanced Transformer architecture that embeds parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into attention mechanisms-for robust and efficient STVSA. A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions.</description>

      <title>Explicit Control Barrier Function-based Safety Filters and their Resource-Aware Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the efficient implementation of safety filters that are designed using control barrier functions (CBFs), which minimally modify a nominal controller to render it safe with respect to a prescribed set of states. Although CBF-based safety filters are often implemented by solving a quadratic program (QP) in real time, the use of off-the-shelf solvers for such optimization problems poses a challenge in applications where control actions need to be computed efficiently at very high frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form expression for controllers obtained through CBF-based safety filters. This expression is obtained by partitioning the state-space into different regions, with a different closed-form solution in each region. We leverage this formula to introduce a resource-aware implementation of CBF-based safety filters that detects changes in the partition region and uses the closed-form expression between changes. We showcase the applicability of our approach in examples ranging from aerospace control to safe reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Traffic Equilibrium in Mixed-Autonomy Network with Capped Customer Waiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified modeling framework to capture the equilibrium-state interactions among ride-hailing companies, travelers, and traffic of mixed-autonomy transportation networks. Our framework integrates four interrelated sub-modules: (i) the operational behavior of representative ride-hailing Mixed-Fleet Traffic Network Companies (MiFleet TNCs) managing autonomous vehicle (AV) and human-driven vehicle (HV) fleets, (ii) traveler mode-choice decisions taking into account travel costs and waiting time, (iii) capped customer waiting times to reflect the option available to travelers not to wait for TNCs' service beyond his/her patience and to resort to existing travel modes, and (iv) a flow-dependent traffic congestion model for travel times. A key modeling feature distinguishes AVs and HVs across the pickup and service (customer-on-board) stages: AVs follow Wardrop pickup routes but may deviate during service under company coordination, whereas HVs operate in the reverse manner. The overall framework is formulated as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP), which is equivalent to a Variational Inequality(VI) formulation based on which the existence of a variational equilibrium solution to the traffic model is established. Numerical experiments examine how AV penetration and Wardrop relaxation factors, which bound route deviation, affect company, traveler, and system performance to various degrees. The results provide actionable insights for policymakers on regulating AV adoption and company vehicle deviation behavior in modern-day traffic systems that are fast changing due to the advances in technology and information accessibility.</description>

      <title>Permutation-Equivariant Learning for Dynamic Security Assessment of Power System Frequency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model-AI framework for real-time dynamic security assessment of frequency stability in power systems. The proposed method rapidly estimates key frequency parameters under a dynamic set of disturbances, which are continuously updated based on operating conditions and unit commitment. To achieve this, the framework builds on a modal-based formulation of the system frequency response (SFR), which leverages the system's eigenstructure to predict key frequency stability metrics. A Deep Sets-inspired neural network is employed to estimate the complex modal coefficients required by the modal-based SFR approach, formulated as a permutation-equivariant learning problem. This enables fast and accurate prediction of the frequency nadir and its timing across different operating conditions and disturbances. The framework achieves scalability by reusing precomputed modal structures and updating only the disturbance-specific coefficients. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without requiring an extensive set of operating scenarios during training or the widespread deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The method is validated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to purely data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>A Novel Phase-Noise Module for the QUCS Circuit Simulator. Part I : the Periodic Steady-State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses work done to expand and extend the capabilities of the open-source QUCS circuit simulator through the implementation of a computationally efficient time-domain steady-state analysis module, supporting simulation of autonomous circuits. To our knowledge, this represents the first time such an analysis module has been implemented in the QUCS environment. Hitherto, the only available option was a harmonic-balance module which was strictly limited to non-autonomous (driven) circuits. The research has several important scientific and industrial applications in the area of large-signal steady-state analysis of autonomous circuits e.g. free-running and coupled oscillator circuit networks. The reported results will have great impact w.r.t. analyzing, synthesizing and optimizing oscillatory behavior of various important industrial circuits and systems. The developed tool, furthermore, introduces support for simulating noise performance of circuits operating under large-signal conditions. This paper is the first part of a two-part series documenting the implementation of a novel (coupled)-oscillator phase-noise simulator engine in the QUCS environment. The goal of this undertaking is the advancement of the open-source QUCS project towards becoming a viable competitor to the commercial simulators currently on the market.</description>

      <title>Structural Sign Herdability in Temporally Switching Networks with Fixed Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates structural herdability in a special class of temporally switching networks with fixed topology. We show that when the underlying digraph remains unchanged across all snapshots, the network attains complete SS herdability even in the presence of signed or layer dilations, a condition not applicable to static networks. This reveals a fundamental structural advantage of temporal dynamics and highlights a novel mechanism through which switching can overcome classical obstructions to herdability. To validate these conclusions, we utilize a more relaxed form of sign matching within each snapshot of the temporal network. Furthermore, we show that when all snapshots share the same underlying topology, the temporally switching network achieves $\mathcal{SS}$ herdability within just two snapshots, which is fewer than the number required for structural controllability. Several examples are included to demonstrate these results.</description>

      <title>Collision-Aware Density-Driven Control of Multi-Agent Systems via Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of safe and efficient area coverage using a multi-agent system operating in environments with obstacles. Applications such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue require robot swarms to cover large domains under resource constraints, making both coverage efficiency and safety essential. To address the efficiency aspect, we adopt the Density-Driven Control (D$^2$C) framework, which uses optimal transport theory to steer agents according to a reference distribution that encodes spatial coverage priorities. To ensure safety, we incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the framework. While CBFs are commonly used for collision avoidance, we extend their applicability by introducing obstacle-specific formulations for both circular and rectangular shapes. In particular, we analytically derive a unit normal vector based on the agent's position relative to the nearest face of a rectangular obstacle, improving safety enforcement in environments with non-smooth boundaries. Additionally, a velocity-dependent term is incorporated into the CBF to enhance collision avoidance. Simulation results validate the proposed method by demonstrating smoother navigation near obstacles and more efficient area coverage than the existing method, while still ensuring collision-free operation.</description>

      <title>Structural Methods for handling mode changes in multimode DAE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid systems are an important concept in Cyber-Physical Systems modeling, for which multiphysics modeling from first principles and the reuse of models from libraries are key. To achieve this, DAEs must be used to specify the dynamics in each discrete state (or mode in our context). This led to the development of DAE-based equational languages supporting multiple modes, of which Modelica is a popular standard. Mode switching can be time- or state-based. Impulsive behaviors can occur at mode changes. While mode changes are well understood in particular physics (e.g., contact mechanics), this is not the case in physics-agnostic paradigms such as Modelica. This situation causes difficulties for the compilation of programs, often requiring users to manually smooth out mode changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the hot restart at mode changes in such paradigms. We propose a mathematical meaning for hot restarts (such a mathematical meaning does not exist in general), as well as a combined structural and impulse analysis for mode changes, generating the hot restart even in the presence of impulses. Our algorithm detects at compile time if the mode change is insufficiently specified, in which case it returns diagnostics information to the user.</description>

      <title>NWP-based Atmospheric Refractivity Modeling and Fast &amp; Stable Non-uniform Plane Wave Ray-Tracing Simulations for LEO Link Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing low-Earth-orbit (LEO) communication link analyses face two main challenges: (1) limited accuracy of 3D atmospheric refractivity reconstructed from sparsely sampled radiosonde data, and (2) numerical instability in previous non-uniform plane-wave ray-tracing algorithms (i.e., underflow under standard double precision), where non-uniform plane waves inevitably arise at complex-valued dielectric interfaces, is caused by extremely small atmospheric loss terms. To address these issues, we reconstruct a high-resolution 3D complex-valued refractivity model using numerical weather prediction data, and develop a fast and numerically stable non-uniform plane-wave ray tracer. The method remains stable in double precision and delivers a 24-fold speedup over high-precision benchmarks. Comparisons show that boresight-error deviations and path-loss differences between the rigorous method and the uniform-plane-wave approximation remain negligible, even under heavy precipitation. Although rays in a lossy atmosphere experience different phase- and attenuation-direction vectors-forming non-uniform plane waves-the resulting effective attenuation along the path is nearly identical to that predicted by the uniform-plane-wave model. These findings justify the continued use of uniform-plane-wave ray tracing in practical LEO link analyses.</description>

      <title>Codeshare agreements between airlines: literature review with the aid of artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codeshare agreements are contracts that allow two or more airlines to share seats on the same flight. These agreements, which are widespread in commercial aviation as a response to highly competitive environments, have enabled the expansion of airline networks without additional costs or risks for the companies involved. The literature presents ambiguous effects associated with the practice, with evidence of increased supply and reduced prices in situations of route complementarity, while also pointing to anti-competitive impacts in markets where companies act as competitors. A review of scientific production over time, including theoretical contributions and case studies, is essential to understand the evolution of these agreements and their implications, especially in the Brazilian context, marked by its own characteristics and particular regulatory history. Thus, this article reviews the literature on codesharing, with an emphasis on the Brazilian market, and uses the Litmaps computational tool, based on artificial intelligence techniques, to support the contextual analysis of publications through their citation relationships. The ultimate goal is to identify and evaluate the main evidence accumulated over decades on the effects of these agreements in Brazil. The joint analysis of the contributions allows us to outline the current state of knowledge, characterize specificities observed in the Brazilian market, and identify gaps that may guide future studies.</description>

      <title>Estimating Hormone Concentrations in the Pituitary-Thyroid Feedback Loop from Irregularly Sampled Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based control techniques have recently been investigated for the recommendation of medication dosages to address thyroid diseases. These techniques often rely on knowledge of internal hormone concentrations that cannot be measured from blood samples. Moreover, the measurable concentrations are typically only obtainable at irregular sampling times. In this work, we empirically verify a notion of sample-based detectability that accounts for irregular sampling of the measurable concentrations on two pituitary-thyroid loop models representing patients with hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, and include the internal concentrations as states. We then implement sample-based moving horizon estimation for the models, and test its performance on virtual patients across a range of sampling schemes. Our study shows robust stability of the estimator across all scenarios, and that more frequent sampling leads to less estimation error in the presence of model uncertainty and misreported dosages.</description>

      <title>Active prognosis and diagnosis of modular discrete-event systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the verification and enforcement of prognosability and diagnosability for discreteevent systems (DESs) modeled by deterministic finite automata. We establish the equivalence between prognosability (respectively, diagnosability) and pre-normality over a subset of the non-faulty language (respectively, a suffix of the faulty language). We then demonstrate the existence of supremal prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) and normal sublanguages. Furthermore, an algorithm is then designed to compute the supremal controllable, normal, and prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) sublanguages. Since DESs are typically composed of multiple components operating in parallel, pure local supervisors are generally insufficient, as prognosability and diagnosability are global properties of a system. Given the limited work on enforcing prognosability or diagnosability in modular DESs, where these properties are enforced through local supervisors, this paper leverages a refined version of pre-normality to compute modular supervisors for local subsystems. The resulting closed-loop system is shown to be globally controllable, normal, and prognosable/ diagnosable. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Stochastic MPC for Joint-in-Time Chance-Constrained Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) framework for linear systems subject to joint-in-time chance constraints under unknown disturbance distributions. Unlike existing stochastic MPC formulations that rely on parametric or Gaussian assumptions or require expensive offline computations, the proposed method leverages conformal prediction (CP) as a streamlined tool to construct finite-sample confidence regions for the system's stochastic error trajectories with minimal computational effort. These regions enable the relaxation of probabilistic constraints while providing formal guarantees. By employing an indirect feedback mechanism and a probabilistic set-based formulation, we prove recursive feasibility of the relaxed optimization problem and establish chance constraint satisfaction in closed-loop. Furthermore, we extend the approach to the more general output feedback setting with unknown measurement noise distributions. Given available noise samples, we establish satisfaction of the joint chance constraints and recursive feasibility via output measurements alone. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Low-Order $\mathcal{H}_2 / \mathcal{H}_\infty$ Controller Design for Aeroelastic Vibration Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an $\mathcal{H}_2 / \mathcal{H}_\infty$ minimization-based output-feedback controller for active aeroelastic vibration suppression in a cantilevered beam. First, a nonlinear structural model incorporating moderate deflection and aerodynamic loading is derived and discretized using the finite element method (FEM). Then, a low-order linear model is identified from random gaussian input response data from the FEM model to synthesize an output-feedback controller using the $\mathcal{H}_2 / \mathcal{H}_\infty$ framework. A frequency-weighted dynamic filter is introduced to emphasize disturbance frequencies of interest, enabling the controller to target dominant vibration modes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for vibration suppression and study its robustness to system parameter variations, including actuator placement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new fuzzy optimization framework that extends FCM causality is proposed. This model utilizes the dynamics to map data into metrics and create a framework that examines logical implication and hierarchy of concepts using a multiplex. Moreover, this is a white-theoretical paper introducing the framework and analyzing the logic and math behind it. Upon this extension the main objectives and the orientation of this framework is expounded and exemplified; this framework is meant for service optimization of information transmission in service process design. Lastly, a thorough analysis of the FHM is included which is done following the logical steps in a simple and elegant manner.</description>

      <title>CHyLL: Learning Continuous Neural Representations of Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Optimality Deviation using the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of approximation error in data-driven optimal control problem of nonlinear systems while using the Koopman operator. While the Koopman operator enables a simplified representation of nonlinear dynamics through a lifted state space, the presence of approximation error inevitably leads to deviations in the computed optimal controller and the resulting value function. We derive explicit upper bounds for these optimality deviations, which characterize the worst-case effect of approximation error. Supported by numerical examples, these theoretical findings provide a quantitative foundation for improving the robustness of data-driven optimal controller design.</description>

      <title>Lies We Can Trust: Quantifying Action Uncertainty with Inaccurate Stochastic Dynamics through Conformalized Nonholonomic Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS), a symmetry-aware conformal prediction-based algorithm that constructs, for a given action, a set guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at a user-defined probability. Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>L2 Ethernet Switch VLSI Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethernet switches are foundational to the global internet infrastructure. These devices route packets of data on a local area network between source addresses to destination media access control addresses. On the L2 layer of the Open Systems Interconnections model, Ethernet switches take in digitized data from a Media Independent Interface and send it to the corresponding output port for the destination address. Switches need to handle parallel input and output streams from each port, prioritizing throughput, efficiency, and packet integrity. Due to the confidential nature of the networking device industry, there do not exist many open source implementations of switching fabrics. We propose an open source design for an L2 Ethernet switch along with the power, performance, and area tradeoffs for architecture decisions.</description>

      <title>Design of a six wheel suspension and a three-axis linear actuation mechanism for a laser weeding robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly utilized in agriculture to automate labor-intensive tasks such as weeding, sowing, harvesting and soil analysis. Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.</description>

      <title>Linear Quadratic Regulators: A New Look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear time-invariant control systems can be considered as finitely generated modules over the commutative principal ideal ring $\mathbb{R}[\frac{d}{dt}]$ of linear differential operators with respect to the time derivative. The Kalman controllability in this algebraic language is translated as the freeness of the system module. Linear quadratic regulators rely on quadratic Lagrangians, or cost functions. Any flat output, i.e., any basis of the corresponding free module leads to an open-loop control strategy via an Euler-Lagrange equation, which becomes here a linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. In this approach, the two-point boundary value problem, including the control variables, becomes tractable. It yields notions of optimal time horizon, optimal parameter design and optimal rest-to-rest trajectories. The loop is closed via an intelligent controller derived from model-free control, which is known to exhibit excellent performance concerning model mismatches and disturbances.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Pressure Recovery in Diffusers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of a data-driven technique based on retrospective cost optimization to optimize the frequency of mass injection into an S-shaped diffuser, with the objective of maximizing the pressure recovery. Experimental data indicated that there is an optimal injection frequency between 100 Hz and 300 Hz with a mass flow rate of 1 percent of the free stream. High-fidelity numerical simulations using compressible unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) are conducted to investigate the mean and temporal features resulting from mass injection into an S-shaped diffuser with differing injection speeds and pulse frequencies. The results are compared with experiments to confirm the accuracy of the numerical solution. Overall, 2-D simulations are relatively in good agreement with the experiment, with 3-D simulations currently under investigation to benchmark the effect of spanwise instabilities. Simulation results with the proposed data-driven technique show improvements upon a baseline case by increasing pressure recovery and reducing the region of flow recirculation within the diffuser.</description>

      <title>Spectral Decompositions of Controllability Gramian and Its Inverse based on System Eigenvalues in Companion Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controllability and observability Gramians, along with their inverses, are widely used to solve various problems in control theory. This paper proposes spectral decompositions of the controllability Gramian and its inverse based on system eigenvalues for a continuous LTI dynamical system in the controllability canonical (companion) form. The Gramian and its inverse are represented as sums of Hermitian matrices, each corresponding to individual system eigenvalues or their pairwise combinations. These decompositions are obtained for the solutions of both algebraic and differential Lyapunov and Riccati equations with arbitrary initial conditions, allowing for the estimation of system spectral properties over an arbitrary time interval and their prediction at future moments. The derived decompositions are also generalized to the case of multiple eigenvalues in the dynamics matrix spectrum, enabling a closed-form estimation of the effects of resonant interactions with the system's eigenmodes. The spectral components are interpreted as measurable quantities in the minimum energy control problem. Therefore, they are unambiguously defined and can quantitatively characterize the influence of individual eigenmodes and associated system devices on controllability, observability, and the asymptotic dynamics of perturbation energy. The additional information obtained from these decompositions can improve the accuracy of algorithms in solving various practical problems, such as stability analysis, minimum energy control, structural design, tuning regulators, optimal placement of actuators and sensors, network analysis, and model order reduction.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Digital Twin of Distributed Link Scheduling for Contention-Aware Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many routing and flow optimization problems in wired networks can be solved efficiently using minimum cost flow formulations. However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Regret Optimal Control Under Moment-Based Ambiguity Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of finite-horizon, linear-quadratic stochastic control problems, where the probability distribution governing the noise process is unknown but assumed to belong to an ambiguity set consisting of all distributions whose mean and covariance lie within norm balls centered at given nominal values. To address the distributional ambiguity, we explore the design of causal affine control policies to minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the given ambiguity set. The resulting minimax optimal control problem is shown to admit an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program that corresponds to a regularized version of the nominal linear-quadratic stochastic control problem. While this convex program can be recast as a semidefinite program, semidefinite programs are typically solved using primal-dual interior point methods that scale poorly with the problem size in practice. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable dual projected subgradient method to compute optimal controllers to an arbitrary accuracy. Numerical experiments are presented to benchmark the proposed method against state-of-the-art data-driven and distributionally robust control design approaches.</description>

      <title>Consensus over Clustered Networks Using Intermittent and Asynchronous Output Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed consensus protocols provide a mechanism for spreading information within clustered networks, allowing agents and clusters to make decisions without requiring direct access to the state of the ensemble. In this work, we propose a strategy for achieving system-wide consensus in the states of identical linear time-invariant systems coupled by an undirected graph whose directed sub-graphs are available only at sporadic times. Within this work, the agents of the network are organized into pairwise disjoint clusters, which induce sub-graphs of the undirected parent graph. Some cluster sub-graph pairs are linked by an inter-cluster sub-graph, where the union of all cluster and inter-cluster sub-graphs yields the undirected parent graph. Each agent utilizes a distributed consensus protocol with components that are updated intermittently and asynchronously with respect to other agents and inter-clusters. The closed-loop ensemble dynamics is modeled as a hybrid system, and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis yields sufficient conditions for rendering the agreement subspace (consensus set) globally exponentially stable. Furthermore, an input-to-state stability argument demonstrates the consensus set is robust to a large class of perturbations. A numerical simulation considering both nominal and perturbed scenarios is provided for validation purposes.</description>

      <title>Impact and Mitigation of Current Saturation Algorithms in Grid-Forming Inverters on Power Swing Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs) are widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, and are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. The corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory. To mitigate this issue, an optimal current saturation strategy is proposed. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</description>

      <title>Adapting to Change: A Comparison of Continual and Transfer Learning for Modeling Building Thermal Dynamics under Concept Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning (CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort. SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Air-ground collaborative intelligence is becoming a key approach for next-generation urban intelligent transportation management, where aerial and ground systems work together on perception, communication, and decision-making. However, the lack of a unified multi-modal simulation environment has limited progress in studying cross-domain perception, coordination under communication constraints, and joint decision optimization. To address this gap, we present TranSimHub, a unified simulation platform for air-ground collaborative intelligence. TranSimHub offers synchronized multi-view rendering across RGB, depth, and semantic segmentation modalities, ensuring consistent perception between aerial and ground viewpoints. It also supports information exchange between the two domains and includes a causal scene editor that enables controllable scenario creation and counterfactual analysis under diverse conditions such as different weather, emergency events, and dynamic obstacles. We release TranSimHub as an open-source platform that supports end-to-end research on perception, fusion, and control across realistic air and ground traffic scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/Traffic-Alpha/TransSimHub.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) collaborative system designed to enhance underwater task performance in extreme sea conditions. The system integrates a dual strategy: (1) high-precision multi-AUV localization enabled by Fisher information matrix-optimized USV path planning, and (2) reinforcement learning-based cooperative planning and control method for multi-AUV task execution. Extensive experimental evaluations in the underwater data collection task demonstrate the system's operational feasibility, with quantitative results showing significant performance improvements over baseline methods. The proposed system exhibits robust coordination capabilities between USV and AUVs while maintaining stability in extreme sea conditions. To facilitate reproducibility and community advancement, we provide an open-source simulation toolkit available at: https://github.com/360ZMEM/USV-AUV-colab .</description>

      <title>JITServe: SLO-aware LLM Serving with Imprecise Request Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications ranging from interactive chatbots to multi-agent systems has introduced a wide spectrum of service-level objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These include latency-sensitive requests emphasizing per-token latency in streaming chat, deadline-sensitive requests requiring rapid full responses to trigger external tools, and compound requests with evolving dependencies across multiple LLM calls. Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs.
  This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs.</description>

      <title>Long-Duration Station-Keeping Strategy for Cislunar Spacecraft Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a novel guidance and control strategy for cislunar near-rectilinear halo orbit formation-keeping applied to high-fidelity dynamics. Bounded relative motion is constructed about long-duration ephemeris trajectories with osculating invariant circles to form quasi-periodic relative orbits. State-of-the-art absolute control strategies are paired with a simple and effective relative control feedback law. Finally, a control barrier function is implemented to ensure recursively passively-safe bounded relative motion under feedback in the presence of possible missed maneuver events for the duration of the formation flight. The strategy is verified in high-fidelity simulation environments through Monte Carlo trials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Composite Neural Architecture Search for Multi-Source RL State Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing state encoders for reinforcement learning (RL) with multiple information sources -- such as sensor measurements, time-series signals, image observations, and textual instructions -- remains underexplored and often requires manual design. We formalize this challenge as a problem of composite neural architecture search (NAS), where multiple source-specific modules and a fusion module are jointly optimized. Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline in which the LLM serves as a neural architecture design agent, leveraging language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders. On a mixed-autonomy traffic control task, our approach discovers higher-performing architectures with fewer candidate evaluations than traditional NAS baselines and the LLM-based GENIUS framework.</description>
