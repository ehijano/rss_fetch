      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>

      <title>The Christoffel problem for the disk area measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, all but one of them are fixed. We provide a solution in the case where the fixed reference bodies are (n-1)-dimensional disks with parallel axes and the measure has no mass at the poles of the sphere determined by this axis.</description>

      <title>A Novel Branch-and-Prune Algorithmic Framework for the 3D Interval Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem: An Approach Based on Torsion Angles of Molecular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distance Geometry plays a central role in determining protein structures from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data, a task known as the Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP). A subclass of this problem, the Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem (DDGP), allows a recursive solution via the combinatorial Branch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm by exploiting specific vertex orderings in protein backbones. To accommodate the inherent uncertainty in NMR data, the interval Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}BP) algorithm was introduced, incorporating interval distance constraints through uniform sampling. In this work, we propose two new algorithmic frameworks for solving the three-dimensional interval DDGP (\textit{i}DDGP): the interval Angular Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}ABP), and its extension, the interval Torsion-angle Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}TBP). These methods convert interval distances into angular constraints, enabling structured sampling over circular arcs. The \textit{i}ABP method guarantees feasibility by construction and removes the need for explicit constraint checking. The \textit{i}TBP algorithm further incorporates known torsion angle intervals, enforcing local chirality and planarity conditions critical for protein geometry. We present formal mathematical foundations for both methods and a systematic strategy for generating biologically meaningful \textit{i}DDGP instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Computational experiments demonstrate that both \textit{i}ABP and \textit{i}TBP consistently outperform \textit{i}BP in terms of solution rate and computational efficiency. In particular, \textit{i}TBP yields solutions with lower RMSD variance relative to the original PDB structures, better reflecting biologically plausible conformations.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs embedded in generic ways and realizing them as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with long-time interest of us, especially, the author, in realizing graphs as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions of certain nice classes.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the set consisting of all components of preimages of all single points and endowed with the quotient topology canonically. In tame cases, such objects are graphs. The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and homeomorphic to a closed interval. These graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry since theory of Morse functions has been established in the former half of the last century.
  We present a new answer to the problem, saying that generically embedded planar graphs are homeomorphic to the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions obtained by elementary polynomials and elementary procedures.</description>

      <title>Circle Squaring with Pieces of Small Boundary and Low Borel Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tarski's Circle Squaring Problem from 1925 asks whether it is possible to partition a disk in the plane into finitely many pieces and reassemble them via isometries to yield a partition of a square of the same area. It was finally resolved by Laczkovich in 1990 in the affirmative. Recently, several new proofs have emerged which achieve circle squaring with better structured pieces: namely, pieces which are Lebesgue measurable and have the property of Baire (Grabowski-M\'ath\'e-Pikhurko) or even are Borel (Marks-Unger).
  In this paper, we show that circle squaring is possible with Borel pieces of positive Lebesgue measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension less than 2 (in particular, each piece is Jordan measurable). We also improve the Borel complexity of the pieces: namely, we show that each piece can be taken to be a Boolean combination of $F_\sigma$ sets. This is a consequence of our more general result that applies to any two bounded subsets of $R^k$, $k\ge 1$, of equal positive measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension smaller than $k$.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Minimal Paper Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A paper torus is an embedded polyhedral torus that is isometric to a flat torus in the intrinsic sense.
  We prove that there does not exist a paper torus with $7$ vertices,
  and that there does exist a paper torus with $8$ vertices.
  This settles the question of the minimum number of
  vertices needed for a paper torus.</description>

      <title>Poncelet triangles: conic loci of the orthocenter and of the isogonal conjugate of a fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that over a Poncelet triangle family interscribed between two nested ellipses $\mathcal{E},\mathcal{E}_c$, (i) the locus of the orthocenter is not only a conic, but it is axis-aligned and homothetic to a $90^o$-rotated copy of $\mathcal{E}$, and (ii) the locus of the isogonal conjugate of a fixed point $P$ is also a conic (the expected degree was four); a parabola (resp. line) if $P$ is on the (degree-four) envelope of the circumcircle (resp. on $\mathcal{E}$). We also show that the envelope of both the circumcircle and radical axis of incircle and circumcircle contain a conic component if and only if $\mathcal{E}_c$ is a circle. The former case is the union of two circles!</description>

      <title>Contractible Vietoris-Rips complexes of $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new, short proof of a result of Virk, that the Vietoris-Rips complex of the group $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with the standard word metric is contractible at large enough scales. This is inspired by a key observation in Virk's proof, but we use Bestvina-Brady discrete Morse theory to get a very short proof with better bounds. In the course of this, we get a new, general criterion for a metric space to have contractible Vietoris-Rips complexes at large enough scales, which could prove useful in the future.</description>
