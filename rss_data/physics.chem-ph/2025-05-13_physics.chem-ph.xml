      <title>Efficient Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields for Liquid and Materials Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a sophisticated tool for cost-efficient atomistic simulations approaching DFT accuracy, with recent message passing MLFFs able to cover the entire periodic table. We present an invariant message passing MLFF architecture (MPNICE) which iteratively predicts atomic partial charges, including long-range interactions, enabling the prediction of charge-dependent properties while achieving 5-20x faster inference versus models with comparable accuracy. We train direct and delta-learned MPNICE models for organic systems, and benchmark against experimental properties of liquid and solid systems. We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties. Finally, we explore multi-task models for both inorganic and organic systems, which exhibit slightly decreased performance on domain-specific tasks but surprising generalization, stably predicting the gas phase structure of $\simeq500$ Pt/Ir organometallic complexes despite never training to organometallic complexes of any kind.</description>

      <title>Conformally-coated Nickel-Carbon Nitride on Structured Pyrolytic Carbon Electrodes for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a three-dimensional electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), tackling challenges in corrosion resistance, catalytic activity, and durability. The electrode features a rod-connected diamond structure made of pyrolytic carbon (PyC), with sequential Ni and CN conformal coatings, resulting in an increase of its electrochemical active surface area more than 80 times their geometric surface area, marking the first application of CN/Ni/RCD-PyC electrodes for HER. The CN layer enhances corrosion resistance under acidic and alkaline conditions, while synergizing with Ni boosts catalytic activity. We demonstrate that the CN/Ni/RCD-PyC electrode exhibited superior HER activity, achieving lower overpotentials of 0.6 V and 0.4 V for a current density of $\mathrm{10~mA\cdot cm^{-2}}$ in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. The electrode demonstrates excellent durability with performance over 2000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry at high scan rates with no significant decay. Therefore, this electrode offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parallelization of Message Passing Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials have achieved great success in accelerating atomistic simulations. Many of them rely on local descriptors that readily allow parallelization. More recent message passing neural network (MPNN) models have demonstrated their superior accuracy and become increasingly popular. However, parallelizing MPNN models for large-scale simulations across compute nodes remains a challenge, as the previously argued poor scalability with the number of MP layers and the necessity of data communication. Here, we propose an efficient parallel algorithm for MPNN models, in which additional data communication is minimized among local atoms only in each MP layer without redundant computation, thus scaling linearly with the layer number. Integrated with our recursively embedded atom neural network model, this algorithm demonstrates excellent strong scaling and weak scaling behaviors in several benchmark systems. This approach enables massive molecular dynamics simulations on MPNN models for hundreds of millions of atoms as fast as on strictly local models, vastly extending the applicability of the MPNN potential to an unprecedented scale. This general parallelization framework can empower various MPNN models to efficiently simulate very large and complex systems.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-motion coupled-cluster variants in combination with perturbative triples corrections in strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report on the implementation of the EOM spin-flip (SF), ionization-potential (IP) and electron-affinity (EA) coupled cluster singles doubles (CCSD) methods for atoms and molecules in strong magnetic fields for energies as well as one-electron properties. Moreover, non-perturbative triples corrections using the EOM-CCSD(T)(a)* scheme were implemented in the finite-field framework for the EE, SF, IP, and EA variants. These developments allow the access to a large variety of electronic states as well as the investigation of IPs and EAs in a strong magnetic field. The latter two indicate the relative stability of the different oxidation states of elements. The increased flexibility to target challenging electronic states and the access to the electronic states of the anion and cation are important for the assignment of spectra from strongly magnetic White Dwarf (WD) stars. Here, we investigate the development of the IPs and EAs in the presence of a magnetic field for the elements of the first and second row of the periodic table. In addition, we study the development of the electronic structure of Na, Mg, and Ca that aided in the assignment of metal lines in a magnetic WD. Lastly, we investigate the electronic excitations of CH in different magnetic-field orientations and strengths, a molecule that has been found in the atmospheres of WD stars.</description>

      <title>Reduced-cost Relativistic Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster Method based on Frozen Natural Spinors: A State-Specific Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the theoretical framework, implementation, and benchmark results for a reduced-cost relativistic equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) method based on state-specific frozen natural spinors (SS-FNS). In this approach, the state-specific frozen natural spinors are derived from the second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) method, providing a compact virtual space for excited-state calculations. The excitation energies computed with the SS-FNS-EE-EOM-CCSD method exhibit smooth convergence with respect to the truncation threshold and demonstrate significant improvements over those obtained using the conventional MP2-based FNS approach. We have implemented the relativistic SS-FNS-EE-EOM-CCSD method using both the four-component Dirac-Coulomb and the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonians to compute excitation energies and transition properties. The X2CAMF-based relativistic EOM-CCSD method emerges as a promising approach for large-scale excited-state calculations, achieving excellent agreement with the standard relativistic EOM-CCSD method based on the untruncated canonical spinor basis, but at a significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Exciton Trap Dynamics and Nonradiative Loss Pathways in Quantum Dots via Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface defects in colloidal quantum dots are a major source of nonradiative losses, yet the microscopic mechanisms underlying exciton trapping and recombination remain elusive. Here, we develop a model Hamiltonian based on atomistic electronic calculations to investigate exciton dynamics in CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs containing a single hole trap introduced by an unpassivated sulfur atom. By systematically varying the defect depth and reorganization energy, we uncover how defect-induced excitonic states mediate energy relaxation pathways. Our simulations reveal that a single localized defect can induce a rich spectrum of excitonic states, leading to multiple dynamical regimes, from slow, energetically off-resonant trapping to fast, cascaded relaxation through in-gap defect states. Crucially, we quantify how defect-induced polaron shifts and exciton-phonon couplings govern the balance between efficient radiative emission and rapid nonradiative decay. These insights clarify the microscopic origin of defect-assisted loss channels and suggest pathways for tailoring QD optoelectronic properties via surface and defect engineering.</description>

      <title>Analytical gradients of random-phase approximation plus corrections from renormalized single excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random-phase approximation (RPA) formulated within the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation framework is a powerful approach to compute the ground-state energies and properties of molecules and materials. Its overall underbinding behavior can be effectively mitigated by a simple correction term, called renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction. Analytical gradient calculations of the RPA energy have become increasingly available, enabling structural relaxations and even molecular dynamics at the RPA level. However, such calculations at the RPA+rSE level have not been reported, due to the lack of the rSE analytical gradient. Here, we present the first formulation and implementation of the analytical gradients of the rSE energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates within an atomic-orbital basis set framework, which allows us to assess the performance of RPA+rSE in determining the molecular geometries and energetics. It is found that the slight overestimation behavior of RPA for small covalently bonded molecules is strengthened by rSE, while such behavior for molecules bonded with purely dispersion interactions is corrected. We further applied the approach to the water clusters, and found that the energy difference between the low-energy isomers of water hexamers is almost unchanged when going from RPA to RPA+rSE geometries. For the bigger WATER27 test set, using the RPA+rSE geometries instead of the RPA ones leads to a slight reduction of the mean absolute error of RPA+rSE from 0.91 kcal/mol to 0.70 kcal/mol, at the complete basis set.</description>

      <title>Valence photoelectron spectra of thiouracils in the gas phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the vibrationally resolved valence photoelectron spectra of the complete series of thiouracils (2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil and 2,4-dithiouracil) for binding energies between 8 and 17 eV. The theoretical spectra were calculated using equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory for ionization potential (EOM-IP-CCSD) combined with the time-independent double-harmonic adiabatic Hessian approach. For all three thiouracils, the first ionization potential is found between 8.4 and 8.7 eV, which is 1 eV lower than for the canonical nucleobase uracil. Ionization bands up to 12 eV show strong vibrational progressions and are well reproduced by the calculations. These bands are attributed to the ionization of (primarily) sulfur- and oxygen-localized valence molecular orbitals. For higher binding energies, the calculations indicate that nonadiabatic couplings are important for the interpretation of the photoelectron spectra.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Machine Learning Potentials for Hydroxide Transport: Surprising Efficiency of Single-Concentration Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transferability of machine learning interatomic potentials across concentration variations in chemically similar systems, using aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions as a case study. Despite containing identical chemical species (K$^+$, OH$^-$, H$_2$O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from ~30 meV/A (at training concentration) to ~90 meV/A (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol/L) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56-17.98 mol/L), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide-hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations - a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.</description>

      <title>Determining Linker Ratios of Mixed Metal-Organic Frameworks via Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial replacement of the organic linkers of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) often optimizes their functionalities, however, accurate characterization of their molar ratios in many cases is challenging. This work presents a method of determining such linker ratios via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of small quantities of powdered samples. The main presumption is taking the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the molar magnetic susceptibility of the two parent MOFs to be additive. To verify this, four examples are provided with commonly used MOFs to represent the cases when both parent MOFs are either paramagnetic or diamagnetic but with different linkers with the following systems: [MIL-101(Cr)-SO$_3$H]$_{(1-\delta)}$[MIL-101(Cr)-NO$_2$]$_{\delta}$, [EuMOF]$_{(1-\delta)}$[EuPDCA]$_{\delta}$, [UiO-66-COOH]$_{(1-\delta)}$[UiO-66]$_{\delta}$ and [MIL-101(Cr) F Free]$_{(1-\delta)}$[MIL-53(Al)]$_{\delta}$, where 1-$\delta$ : $\delta$ are the ratios to be determined. Depending on whether the systems were strictly paramagnetic, strictly diamagnetic or mixed, the experimental error of $\delta$ ranged between 0.00002 and 0.012, respectively. We expect the presented method to be widely employed since samples only need to be in powdered form and because there is a lack of characterization tools in the area of MOF linker ratios. The presented method is also applicable to resolving the ratios of mixed ordinary paramagnetic systems as well as other types of non-magnetic composite materials such as tapes, zeolites and thin films.</description>

      <title>Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer MoS$_2$ has long served as a prototypical material exhibiting valleytronic behavior, yet it remains unclear exactly how phonons induce a valley depolarization of its excitonic states. Here, we apply a mixed quantum--classical simulation framework to study the phonon-induced mechanisms affecting valley polarization at short times. Our framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, while retaining explicit information on transient phonon occupancies. By means of such occupancies, our simulations show a resonance between the lowest exciton band and the dominant optical phonon branch to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of breaking down a target molecule into simpler precursors through a series of valid reactions, stands at the core of organic chemistry and drug development. Although recent machine learning (ML) research has advanced single-step retrosynthetic modeling and subsequent route searches, these solutions remain restricted by the extensive combinatorial space of possible pathways. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable chemical knowledge, hinting at their potential to tackle complex decision-making tasks in chemistry. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can successfully navigate the highly constrained, multi-step retrosynthesis planning problem. We introduce an efficient scheme for encoding reaction pathways and present a new route-level search strategy, moving beyond the conventional step-by-step reactant prediction. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that our LLM-augmented approach excels at retrosynthesis planning and extends naturally to the broader challenge of synthesizable molecular design.</description>

      <title>Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</description>

Abstract: The electrochemical performances of the {\alpha}-MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 and {\delta}-MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 nanostructures in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis were compared herein. Both materials were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route. Their structures and morphologies were analyzed by SEM, HRTEM, XPS, Raman Scattering and XRD, and their ORR electrochemical properties and H2O2 electrosynthesis efficacies were investigated in alkaline NaOH solutions applying the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setups in acid media aiming at H2O2 formation were also performed. The 3% {\delta}-MnO2/C and 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalysts were more efficient and selective than pure Vulcan XC-72 through the ORR 2-electron pathway in the RRDE essays. Concerning H2O2 electrogeneration using GDE, the 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalyst displayed better activity, with peroxide accumulation of 402.6 mg/L at -1.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl) after 120 min, 48 % higher than pure Vulcan XC-72 GDE. These results can be ascribed to a synergistic effect between {\alpha}-MnO2 and Vulcan XC-72, as well as oxygen functional acid species improvement, increasing electrocatalytic surface hydrophilicity and enhancing H2O2 electrosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Predicting solvation free energies with an implicit solvent machine learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) potentials are a powerful tool in molecular modeling, enabling ab initio accuracy for comparably small computational costs. Nevertheless, all-atom simulations employing best-performing graph neural network architectures are still too expensive for applications requiring extensive sampling, such as free energy computations. Implicit solvent models could provide the necessary speed-up due to reduced degrees of freedom and faster dynamics. Here, we introduce a Solvation Free Energy Path Reweighting (ReSolv) framework to parametrize an implicit solvent ML potential for small organic molecules that accurately predicts the hydration free energy, an essential parameter in drug design and pollutant modeling. With a combination of top-down (experimental hydration free energy data) and bottom-up (ab initio data of molecules in a vacuum) learning, ReSolv bypasses the need for intractable ab initio data of molecules in explicit bulk solvent and does not have to resort to less accurate data-generating models. On the FreeSolv dataset, ReSolv achieves a mean absolute error close to average experimental uncertainty, significantly outperforming standard explicit solvent force fields. Compared to the explicit solvent ML potential, ReSolv offers a computational speedup of four orders of magnitude and attains closer agreement with experiments. The presented framework paves the way toward deep molecular models that are more accurate yet computationally cheaper than classical atomistic models.</description>

      <title>Transcorrelated Theory with Pseudopotentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transcorrelated (TC) method performs a similarity transformation on the
  electronic Schr\"odinger equation via Jastrow factorization of the wave function. This
  has demonstrated significant advancements in computational
  electronic structure theory by
  improving basis set convergence and compactifying the description of the wave function. In
  this work, we introduce a new approach that incorporates pseudopotentials (PPs) into the
  TC framework, significantly accelerating Jastrow factor optimization and reducing
  computational costs. Our results for ionization potentials, atomization energies, and
  dissociation curves of first-row atoms and molecules show that PPs provide chemically
  accurate descriptions across a range of systems and give guidelines for future
  theory and applications.
  The new pseudopotential-based TC method opens possibilities for applying TC to more complex
  and larger systems, such as transition metals and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle [Bai \&amp; Breen, \emph{J. Graph. Tools}, \textbf{13}(4), 53, (2008)]. However, this approach involves averaging of the particles in a non-physically meaningful way resulting in inaccurate centres of mass. Instead the intrinsic weighted average should be computed, but the analytical calculation of this is computationally expensive and complex. Here, we propose a more computationally efficient approach to compute the intrinsic mean that is suitable for the majority of chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with seniority-zero trial wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach that uses the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) wave function as the trial wave function in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). DOCI is a seniority-zero method focused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron configurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction method, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent ph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also explore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We test this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond breaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely matches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems, such as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and water, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space models may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly correlated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended space. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and OO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a path to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.</description>

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>The Q-AMOEBA (CF) Polarizable Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Q-AMOEBA (CF), an enhanced version of the Q-AMOEBA polarizable model that integrates a geometry-dependent charge flux (CF) term while designed for an explicit treatment of nuclear quantum effects (NQE). The inclusion of CF effects allows matching experimental data for the molecular structure of water in both gas and liquid phases, addressing limitations faced by most force fields. We show that Q-AMOEBA (CF) provides highly accurate results for a wide range of thermodynamical properties of liquid water. Using the computational efficiency of the adaptive Quantum Thermal Bath method, which accounts for NQE at a cost comparable to classical molecular dynamics, we evaluate the robustness and transferability of Q-AMOEBA (CF) by calculating hydration free energies of various ions and organic molecules. Finally, we apply this methodology to the alanine dipeptide and compute the corresponding dihedral angle potential of mean force and hydration free energy. Unexpectedly, the latter quantity displays significant NQE. These results pave the way to a finer understanding of their role in biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Silk: A promising natural blend of amino acids for efficient CO2 capture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, various nanoporous solid sorbents have drawn significant research interest as promising carbon capture materials. However, the issues of high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain challenges to overcome before their practical implementation. In contrast, natural silk-fibroin, a blend of various amino acids, could be a promising material to realize low-cost carbon capture technology due to its amine-like CO2 capture behavior, light weight, natural abundance, scalable processing, and biocompatibility. Here, we present mulberry silk-derived silk-nano-fibroin aerogel that exhibits a high specific surface area and a remarkably high CO2 adsorption capacity (~3.65+-0.18 mmol CO2/gm sorbent at 0.15 atm CO2 and 5 oC), making it competitive with state-of-the-art solid sorbents. The thermogravimetry analysis reveals that the thermal degradation temperature of silk-nano-fibroin aerogel is around 250 {\deg}C, significantly higher than conventional amines used for carbon capture. Furthermore, the silk-nano-fibroin-based sorbent demonstrates rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, complete regeneration at a temperature as low as 60 {\deg}C, promising stability over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintains its adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Overall, this study highlights natural silk's promising carbon capture potential for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Simplification of Linearized Coupled Cluster Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearized Coupled Cluster Doubles (LinCCD) often provides near-singular energies in small-gap systems that exhibit static correlation. This has been attributed to the lack of quadratic $T_2^2$ terms that typically balance out small energy denominators in the CCD amplitude equations. Herein, I show that exchange contributions to ring and crossed-ring contractions (not small denominators per se) cause the divergent behavior of LinCC(S)D approaches. Rather than omitting exchange terms, I recommend a regular and size-consistent method that retains only linear ladder diagrams. As LinCCD and configuration interaction doubles (CID) equations are isomorphic, this also implies that simplification (rather than quadratic extensions) of CID amplitude equations can lead to a size-consistent theory. Linearized ladder CCD (LinLCCD) is robust in statically-correlated systems and can be made $O(n_{\text{occ}}^4n_{\text{vir}}^2)$ with a hole-hole approximation. The results presented here show that LinLCCD and its hole-hole approximation can accurately capture energy differences, even outperforming full CCD and CCSD for non-covalent interactions in small-to-medium sized molecules, setting the stage for further adaptations of these approaches that incorporate more dynamical correlation.</description>

      <title>Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Recently, we suggested an analytical approach based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). Here, we extend the MEM+DEM approach for particles of various shapes and orientations. To illustrate the possibilities of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 100 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL, except for some disagreement between MEM and COMSOL solutions for bicones with small rounding radii. To illustrate the application of our method, we prepared 12 AuNR samples using a chemical etching with fine tuning of the LPR over the 1020-580 nm range. By including the CTAB shell in the simulation model, we achieved excellent agreement between the calculated and measured dependence of the LPR peak position on the AuNR aspect ratio. In summary, our method uses the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build analytical models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.</description>

Abstract: Water is an unusual liquid. Its thermophysical properties are non-monotonic with temperature T and pressure p. It's not been known how water's behaviors are encoded in its molecules. We give a statistical physics model, Cage Water, which assumes three bonding states: van der Waals, pairwise hydrogen bonding, and multi-body cooperative caging hydrogen bonds. The model is analytical, so very fast to compute, yet it gives excellent agreement with extensive pT experiments. Through readily interpretable substates, Cage Water explains water's liquid anomalies -- including its controversial liquid-liquid supercooling transition -- as simple switchovers among the three bonding types.</description>
