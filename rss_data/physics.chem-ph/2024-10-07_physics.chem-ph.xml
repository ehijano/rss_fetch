      <title>Beyond CCSD(T) accuracy at lower scaling with auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a black-box auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach to perform highly accurate electronic structure calculations using configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) trial states. This method consistently provides more accurate energy estimates than coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), often regarded as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. This level of precision is achieved at a lower asymptotic computational cost, scaling as $O(N^6)$ compared to the $O(N^7)$ scaling of CCSD(T). We provide numerical evidence supporting these findings through results for challenging main group and transition metal-containing molecules.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potentials for redox chemistry in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) represent atomic interactions with quantum mechanical accuracy offering an efficient tool for atomistic simulations in many fields of science. However, most MLPs rely on local atomic energies without information about the global composition of the system. To date, this has prevented the application of MLPs to redox reactions in solution, which involve chemical species in different oxidation states and electron transfer between them. Here, we show that fourth-generation MLPs overcome this limitation and can provide a physically correct description of redox chemical reactions. For the example of ferrous (Fe$^{2+}$) and ferric (Fe$^{3+}$) ions in water we show that the correct oxidation states are obtained matching the number of chloride counter ions irrespective of their positions in the system. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can describe electron-transfer processes between ferrous and ferric ions, paving the way to simulations of general redox chemistry in solution.</description>

      <title>Assessing many-body methods on the potential energy surface of the (H$_2$)$_2$ hydrogen dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic potential energy surface of the (H$_2$)$_2$ dimer represents a challenging problem for many-body methods. Here, we determine the potential energy curves of five different dimer configurations (T, Z, X, H, L) using the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method and a number of approximate functionals within density functional theory (DFT), including advanced orbital-dependent functionals based on the random phase approximation (RPA). We assess their performance in describing the potential wells, bond distances and relative energies. The repulsive potential wall is studied by looking at the relative stability of the different dimer configurations as a function of an applied force acting along the intermolecular axis. It is shown that most functionals within DFT break down at finite compression, even those that give an accurate description around the potential well minima. Only by including exchange within RPA a qualitatively correct description along the entire potential energy curve is obtained. Finally, we discuss these results in the context of solid molecular hydrogen at finite pressures.</description>

      <title>Characterization of monosubstituted benzene ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aromatic structures are fundamental for key biological molecules such as RNA and metabolites and the abundances of aromatic molecules on young planets are therefore of high interest. Recent detections of benzonitrile and other aromatic compounds in interstellar clouds and comets have revealed a rich aromatic astrochemistry. In the cold phases of star and planet formation, most of these aromatic molecules are likely to reside in icy grain mantles, where they could be observed through IR spectroscopy. We present laboratory IR spectra of benzene and four monosubstituted benzene molecules -- toluene, phenol, benzonitrile and benzaldehyde -- to determine their IR ice absorbances in undiluted aromatic ices, and in mixtures with water and CO. We also characterize the aromatic ice desorption rates, and extract binding energies and respective pre-exponential factors using temperature programmed desorption experiments. We use these to predict at which protostellar and protoplanetary disk temperatures these molecules sublimate into the gas-phase. We find that benzene and mono-substituted benzene derivatives are low-volatility with binding energies in the 5220-8390 K (43-70 kJ/mol) range, which suggests that most of the chemistry of benzene and of functionalized aromatic molecules is to be expected to occur in the ice phase during star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD with Complex-Valued Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) and coupled cluster theory restricted to paired double excitations (pCCD) are emerging as efficient methodologies for accounting for the so-called non-dynamic electronic correlation effects. Up to now, molecular calculations have been performed with real-valued orbitals. However, before extending the applicability of these methodologies to extended systems, where Bloch states are employed, the subtleties of working with complex-valued orbitals and the consequences of imposing time-reversal symmetry must be carefully addressed. In this work, we describe the theoretical and practical implications of adopting time-reversal symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD when allowing for complex-valued orbital coefficients. The theoretical considerations primarily affect the optimization algorithms, while the practical implications raise fundamental questions about the stability of solutions. Specifically, we find that complex solutions lower the energy when non-dynamic electronic correlation effects are pronounced. We present numerical examples to illustrate and discuss these instabilities and possible problems introduced by N-representability violations.</description>

      <title>Manganese oxide-functionalized graphene sponge electrodes for electrochemical chlorine-free disinfection of tap water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-cost reduced graphene oxide sponges functionalized with manganese oxide were used as electrodes for the disinfection of Escherichia coli in water. Manganese oxide was doped with amino groups MnxOyNH2 to strengthen the bond with the graphene coating and improve the electrochemical stability of the sponge. The Mn II and Mn III incorporated into the graphene coating favored the formation of oxygen vacancies and enhanced the electric and catalytic properties of the anode. Electrooxidation of real tap water at 29 A m2 resulted in 2.2 log removal of E. coli. After storing the treated samples for 18 h at 25 and 37 {\deg}C, the removal of E. coli increased to 3.3 and 4.6 log, respectively, demonstrating the irreparable damage to the bacterial cells via low-voltage electroporation, and the key role of storage temperature in their further inactivation. The energy consumption of the system treating real low conductivity tap water was 1.2-1.6 kWh m-3. Finally, experiments with intermittent current suggest the contribution of the pseudo-capacitance of the graphene sponge to electrochemical disinfection during the OFF periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of manganese oxide-functionalized graphene sponges for the chlorine-free disinfection of water.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence for Navigating Synthesizable Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SynFormer, a generative modeling framework designed to efficiently explore and navigate synthesizable chemical space. Unlike traditional molecular generation approaches, we generate synthetic pathways for molecules to ensure that designs are synthetically tractable. By incorporating a scalable transformer architecture and a diffusion module for building block selection, SynFormer surpasses existing models in synthesizable molecular design. We demonstrate SynFormer's effectiveness in two key applications: (1) local chemical space exploration, where the model generates synthesizable analogs of a reference molecule, and (2) global chemical space exploration, where the model aims to identify optimal molecules according to a black-box property prediction oracle. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach via the improvement in performance as more computational resources become available. With our code and trained models openly available, we hope that SynFormer will find use across applications in drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>Exploring the exact limits of the real-time equation-of-motion coupled cluster cumulant Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the properties of the recently proposed real-time equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (RT-EOM-CC) cumulant Green's function approach [J. Chem. Phys. 2020, 152, 174113]. We specifically focus on identifying the limitations of the original time-dependent coupled cluster (TDCC) ansatz and propose an enhanced double TDCC ansatz ensuring the exactness in the expansion limit. Additionally, we introduce a practical cluster-analysis-based approach for characterizing the peaks in the computed spectral function from the RT-EOM-CC cumulant Green's function approach, which is particularly useful for the assignments of satellite peaks when many-body effects dominate the spectra. Our preliminary numerical tests focus on reproducing, approximating, and characterizing the exact impurity Green's function of the three-site and four-site single impurity Anderson models using the RT-EOM-CC cumulant Green's function approach. The numerical tests allow us to have a direct comparison between the RT-EOM-CC cumulant Green's function approach and other Green's function approaches in the numerical exact limit.</description>

      <title>Classification and Spatiotemporal Correlation of Dominant Fluctuations in Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of many complex systems, from nanostructured materials to animal colonies, is governed by local transitions that, while involving a restricted number of interacting units, may generate collective cascade phenomena. Tracking such local events and understanding how they emerge and propagate throughout these systems represent often a challenge. Common strategies monitor specific parameters, tailored ad hoc to describe certain systems, over time. However, such approaches typically require prior knowledge of the underpinning physics and are poorly transferable to different systems. Here we present LEAP, a general, transferable, agnostic analysis approach that can reveal precious information on the physics of a variety of complex dynamical systems simply starting from the trajectory of their constitutive units. Built on a bivariate combination of two abstract descriptors, LENS and {\tau}SOAP, the LEAP analysis allows (i) detecting the emergence of local fluctuations in simulation or experimentally-acquired trajectories of any type of multicomponent system, (ii) classifying fluctuations into categories, and (iii) correlating them in space and time. We demonstrate how LEAP, just building on the abstract concepts of local fluctuations and their spatiotemporal correlation, efficiently reveals precious insights on the emergence and propagation of local and collective phenomena in a variety of complex dynamical systems ranging from the atomic- to the microscopic-scale. Given its abstract character, we expect that LEAP will offer an important tool to understand and predict the behavior of systems whose physics is unknown a priori, as well as to revisit a variety of known complex physical phenomena under a new perspective.</description>

      <title>Machine learning surrogate models for particle insertions and element substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two machine learning-aided thermodynamic integration schemes to compute the chemical potentials of atoms and molecules have been developed and compared. One is the particle insertion method, and the other combines particle insertion with element substitution. In the former method, the species is gradually inserted into the liquid, and its chemical potential is computed. In the latter method, after the particle insertion, the inserted species is substituted with another species, and the chemical potential of this new species is computed. In both methods, the thermodynamic integrations are conducted using machine-learned potentials trained on first-principles datasets. The errors of the machine-learned surrogate models are further corrected by performing thermodynamic integrations from the machine-learned potentials to the first-principles potentials, accurately providing the first-principles chemical potentials. These two methods are applied to compute the real potentials of proton, alkali metal cations, and halide anions in water. The applications indicate that these two entirely different thermodynamic pathways yield identical real potentials within statistical error bars, demonstrating that both methods provide reproducible real potentials. The computed real potentials and solvation structures are also in good agreement with past experiments and simulations. These results indicate that machine learning surrogate models enabling the atomic insertion and element substitution provide a precise method for determining the chemical potentials of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Self-replicating fuels via autocatalytic molecular bond fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This computational study advances a theoretical framework for practical, electrochemical fuel generation displaying exponential product yields and product formation rates as functions of time. Exponential reaction scaling is simulated through an autocatalytic cycle that emulates the process of DNA replication facilitated by the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, an initial buildup of formate into a two-carbon chain through CO2 carboxylation forms oxalate. A subsequent, two-electron reduction yields glyoxylate, with base-mediated hydrolysis driving C-C bond fission of glyoxylate into two molecules of formate. These products are then recycled back to serve as reactants. This recursive process chemistry displays 2^n stoichiometries with respect to formate growth in the limit of ideal reaction selectivity. Each step of the proposed fuel cycle shows direct analogy to the steps of DNA annealing, nucleotide polymerization and hybridized strand fission that are responsible for the exponential product yields observed in PCR-mediated DNA synthesis. As a consequence of this replication behavior, rapid rates of fuel production are accessible even when the individual rate constants for the cycle's constituent processes are slow. Significant focus is placed on practical routes for realizing each of the three steps comprising this model case of formate replication, particularly the challenge of formate carboxylation and the corresponding energy demands and power constraints of the overall process.</description>

      <title>Tensorized orbitals for computational chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choosing a basis set is the first step of a quantum chemistry calculation and it sets its maximum accuracy. This choice of orbitals is limited by strong technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of six dimensional Coulomb integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into ``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, Slater orbitals, linear combination thereof as well as new orbitals beyond the above. Our method provides a path for building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been accessible with previous technology. As an illustration, we construct optimized tensorized orbitals and obtain a 85\% reduction of the error on the energy of the $H_2$ molecules with respect to a reference double zeta calculation (cc-pvDz) of the same size.</description>

      <title>Solvent-cosolvent attraction is sufficient to induce polymer collapse in good solvent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when two miscible, competing good solvents for a polymer are mixed, resulting in a loss of solubility. In this study, we demonstrate through simulations, supported by theory, that cononsolvency can be driven solely by solvent-cosolvent attraction ($\epsilon_{sc}$). The primary mechanism underlying this behavior is the emergent depletion effect, which is amplified by solvent-cosolvent interactions. The polymer reaches a compact state when the solvent and cosolvent fractions are equal ($x_s = x_c = 0.5$), a finding that aligns with predictions from Flory-Huggins theory and the random phase approximation. We show that this cononsolvency behavior is observed for different cosolvent sizes, provided the cosolvent density remains below the depletion threshold and the sizes of solvent and cosolvent particles are not smaller than the monomer size. Additionally, we investigate the role of temperature and find that cononsolvency weakens as temperature increases, due to a reduction in the depletion effect. Finally, we show that when preferential cosolvent attraction is introduced in this simple model, it leads to cononsolvency driven by bridging interactions, occurring at lower cosolvent fractions ($x_c &lt; 0.5$).</description>
