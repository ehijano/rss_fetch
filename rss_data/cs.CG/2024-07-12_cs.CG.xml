      <title>Geometry-based Multi-beam Survey Line Layout Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-beam measurement system plays a crucial role in ocean mapping and underwater terrain detection. By simultaneously transmitting multiple beams, the system can accurately receive sound waves reflected from the seabed, providing more precise and comprehensive water depth information while effectively revealing the complexity and characteristics of underwater terrain. Building upon the background and application provided by Question B of the 2023 National Mathematical Contest in Modeling for College Students, this paper investigates the relationship between ocean floor width measurement and factors such as beam position, angle, and slope. Utilizing geometric relations, trigonometric similarity, and sine theorem, a mathematical model is established to determine adjacent strip coverage width and overlap ratio. Furthermore, an optimal strategy is determined using a greedy algorithm, while binary search backtracking is employed to derive the interval of the next adjacent survey line with the required overlap ratio in order to obtain an optimal terrain detection strategy.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Diffusion for Unsupervised Smooth Non-Rigid 3D Shape Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most recent unsupervised non-rigid 3D shape matching methods are based on the functional map framework due to its efficiency and superior performance. Nevertheless, respective methods struggle to obtain spatially smooth pointwise correspondences due to the lack of proper regularisation. In this work, inspired by the success of message passing on graphs, we propose a synchronous diffusion process which we use as regularisation to achieve smoothness in non-rigid 3D shape matching problems. The intuition of synchronous diffusion is that diffusing the same input function on two different shapes results in consistent outputs. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our novel regularisation can substantially improve the state-of-the-art in shape matching, especially in the presence of topological noise.</description>

      <title>Hybrid k-Clustering: Blending k-Median and k-Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel clustering model encompassing two well-known clustering models: k-center clustering and k-median clustering. In the Hybrid k-Clusetring problem, given a set P of points in R^d, an integer k, and a non-negative real r, our objective is to position k closed balls of radius r to minimize the sum of distances from points not covered by the balls to their closest balls. Equivalently, we seek an optimal L_1-fitting of a union of k balls of radius r to a set of points in the Euclidean space. When r=0, this corresponds to k-median; when the minimum sum is zero, indicating complete coverage of all points, it is k-center.
  Our primary result is a bicriteria approximation algorithm that, for a given \epsilon&gt;0, produces a hybrid k-clustering with balls of radius (1+\epsilon)r. This algorithm achieves a cost at most 1+\epsilon of the optimum, and it operates in time 2^{(kd/\epsilon)^{O(1)}} n^{O(1)}. Notably, considering the established lower bounds on k-center and k-median, our bicriteria approximation stands as the best possible result for Hybrid k-Clusetring.</description>

      <title>Concise Plane Arrangements for Low-Poly Surface and Volume Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plane arrangements are a useful tool for surface and volume modelling. However, their main drawback is poor scalability. We introduce two key novelties that enable the construction of plane arrangements for complex objects and entire scenes: (i) an ordering scheme for the plane insertion and (ii) the direct use of input points during arrangement construction. Both ingredients reduce the number of unwanted splits, resulting in improved scalability of the construction mechanism by up to two orders of magnitude compared to existing algorithms. We further introduce a remeshing and simplification technique that allows us to extract low-polygon surface meshes and lightweight convex decompositions of volumes from the arrangement. We show that our approach leads to state-of-the-art results for the aforementioned tasks by comparing it to learning-based and traditional approaches on various different datasets. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/raphaelsulzer/compod .</description>
