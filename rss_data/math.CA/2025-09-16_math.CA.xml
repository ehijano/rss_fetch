      <title>Conditional existence of maximizers for the Tomas-Stein inequality for the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tomas-Stein inequality for a compact subset $\Gamma$ of the sphere $S^d$ states that the mapping $f\mapsto \widehat{f\sigma}$ is bounded from $L^2(\Gamma,\sigma)$ to $L^{2+4/d}(\R^{d+1})$. Then conditional on a strict comparison between the best constants for the sphere and for the Strichartz inequality for the Schr\"odinger equations, we prove that there exist functions which extremize this inequality, and any extremising sequence has a subsequence which converges to an extremizer. The method is based on the refined Tomas-Stein inequality for the sphere and the profile decompositions. The key ingredient to establish orthogonality in profile decompositions is that we use Tao's sharp bilinear restriction theorem for the paraboloids beyond the Tomas-Stein range. Similar results have been previously established by Frank, Lieb and Sabin \cite{Frank-Lieb-Sabin:2007:maxi-sphere-2d}, where they used the method of the missing mass.</description>

      <title>Minimizing measures for the doubling condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study those measures whose doubling constant is the least possible among doubling measures on a given metric space. It is shown that such measures exist on every metric space supporting at least one doubling measure. In addition, a connection between minimizers for the doubling constant and superharmonic functions is exhibited. This allows us to show that for the particular case of the euclidean space $\mathbb R^d$, Lebesgue measure is the only minimizer for the doubling constant (up to constant multiples) precisely when $d=1$ or $d=2$, while for $d\geq3$ there are infinitely many independent minimizers. Analogously, in the discrete setting, we can show uniqueness of the counting measure as a minimizer for regular graphs where the standard random walk is a recurrent Markov chain. The counting measure is also shown to be a minimizer in every infinite graph where the cardinality of balls depends solely on their radii.</description>

      <title>Zeros and exponential profiles of polynomials II: Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Jalowy, Kabluchko, Marynych, arXiv:2504.11593v1, 2025], the authors discuss a user-friendly approach to determine the limiting empirical zero distribution of a sequence of real-rooted polynomials, as the degree goes to $\infty$. In this note, we aim to apply it to a vast range of examples of polynomials providing a unifying source for limiting empirical zero distributions.
  We cover Touchard, Fubini, Eulerian, Narayana and little $q$-Laguerre polynomials as well as hypergeometric polynomials including the classical Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. We construct polynomials whose empirical zero distributions converge to the free multiplicative normal and Poisson distributions. Furthermore, we study polynomials generated by some differential operators. As one inverse result, we derive coefficient asymptotics of the characteristic polynomial of random covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>Can a small Gaussian perturbation break subadditivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $a\ge 1$, a function $f: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be $a$-subadditive if $$ f(ax+y) \le af(x)+f(y) \,\,\,\text{ for all }x,y \in \mathbb{R}. $$ Of course, $1$-subadditive functions (which correspond to ordinary subadditive functions) are $2$-subadditive. % and $3$-subadditive. Answering a question of Matkowski, we show that there exists a continuous function $f$ satisfying $f(0)=0$ which is $2$-subadditive but not $1$-subadditive. In addition, the same example is not $3$-subadditive, which shows that the sequence of families of continuous $a$-subadditive functions passing through the origin is not increasing with respect to $a$. The construction relies on a perturbation of a given subadditive function with an even Gaussian ring, which will destroy the original subadditivity while keeping the weaker property.
  Lastly, given a positive rational cone $H\subseteq (0,\infty)$ which is not finitely generated, we prove that there exists a subadditive bijection $f:H\to H$ such that $\liminf_{x\to 0}f(x)=0$ and $\limsup_{x\to 0}f(x)=1$. This is related an open question of Matkowski and {\'S}wi{\k a}tkowski in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 119 (1993), 187--197].</description>

      <title>Weighted inequalities for variation operators associated with fractional Schr\"{o}dinger semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{e^{-tL^{\alpha}}\}_{t&gt;0}$ be the fractional Schr\"{o}dinger semigroup associated with $L=-\Delta+V$, where $V$ is a non-negatvie potential belonging to the reverse H\"{o}lder class. In this paper, we establish weighted boundedness properties of the variation operator related to $\{e^{-tL^{\alpha}}\}_{t&gt;0}$, including weighted $L^{p}-L^{q}$ quantitative inequalities and mixed weak-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Leading order asymptotics for non-local energies and the Read-Shockley law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an energy minimization problem $\sum_{i \neq j} W(z_i - z_j)$ for $N$ points $\left\{z_1, \dots, z_N\right\}$ with applications in dislocation theory. The $N$ points lie in the two-dimensional domain $\mathbb{R} \times [-\pi, \pi]$, %who are trying to minimize their interaction energy where
  where the kernel $W$ is derived from the Volterra potential $V(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2}-\frac12\log(x^2+y^2)$. We prove that the minimum energy is given by $- N \log{N} +\mathcal{O}(N)$. This lower bound recovers the leading order term of the Read-Shockley law characterizing the energy of small angle grain boundaries in polycrystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the authors survey and review the studies of boundary value problems for regular functions in Clifford analysis, which include theoretical foundations and useful methods. Its theoretical bases consist of the generalized Cauchy theorem, the generalized Cauchy integral formula, the Painlev\'{e} theorem and boundary behaviors of the Cauchy type integrals, as well as various integral representations. Certain boundary value problems in the Clifford algebra setting and singular integral equations are introduced.</description>

      <title>Falconer's problem for dot product on paraboloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish dimensional thresholds for dot product sets associated with compact subsets of translated paraboloids. Specifically, we prove that when the dimension of such a subset exceeds $ \frac{5}{4} = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{4} $ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and $ \frac{d}{2} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8d - 4} $ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\geq 4$, its dot product set has positive Lebesgue measure.
  This result demonstrates that if a compact set in $ \mathbb{R}^d $ exhibits a paraboloidal structure, then the usual dimensional barrier of $ \frac{d}{2} $ for dot product sets can be lowered for $ d \geq 3 $. Our work serves as the continuous counterpart of a paper by Che-Jui Chang, Ali Mohammadi, Thang Pham, and Chun-Yen Shen, which examines the finite field setting with partial reliance on the extension conjecture.
  The key idea, closely following their paper, is to reformulate the dot product set on the paraboloid as a variant of a distance set. This reformulation allows us to leverage state-of-the-art results from the pinned distance problem, as established by Larry Guth, Alex Iosevich, Yumeng Ou, and Hong Wang for $ d = 2 $, and by Xiumin Du, Yumeng Ou, Kevin Ren, and Ruixiang Zhang for higher dimensions. Finally, we present explicit constructions and existence proofs that highlight the sharpness of our results.</description>

      <title>Frame redundancy and Beurling density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the frame measure function of a frame in certain reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces on metric measure spaces is given by the reciprocal of the Beurling density of its index set. In addition, we show that each such frame with Beurling density greater than one contains a subframe with Beurling density arbitrary close to one. This confirms that the concept of frame measure function as introduced by Balan and Landau is a meaningful quantitative definition for the redundancy of a large class of infinite frames. In addition, it shows that the necessary density conditions for sampling in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces obtained by F\"uhr, Gr\"ochenig, Haimi, Klotz and Romero are optimal. As an application, we also settle the open questions of the existence of frames near the critical density for exponential frames on unbounded sets and for nonlocalized Gabor frames. The techniques used in this paper combine a selector form of Weaver's conjecture and various methods for quantifying the overcompleteness of frames.</description>

      <title>Approximating the operator norm of local Hamiltonians via few quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</description>

      <title>Endpoint estimates for maximal operators associated to the wave equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $H^{s}$--$L^q$ maximal estimates associated to the wave operator \begin{equation*}
  e^{ it\sqrt{-\Delta}}f(x) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} e^{i(x \cdot \xi \, + t|\xi|)} \widehat{f}(\xi\,) d\xi. \end{equation*} Rogers--Villarroya proved $H^{s}$--$L^q$ estimates for the maximal operator $f\mapsto$ $\sup_{t} |e^{ it\sqrt{-\Delta}}f|$ up to the critical Sobolev exponents $s_c(q,d)$. However, the endpoint case estimates for the critical exponent $s=s_c(q,d)$ have remained open so far. We obtain the endpoint $H^{s_c(q,d)}$--$L^q$ bounds on the maximal operator $f\mapsto \sup_{t} |e^{ it\sqrt{-\Delta}}f|$. We also prove that several different forms of the maximal estimates considered by Rogers--Villarroya are basically equivalent to each other.</description>

      <title>On a specific family of orthogonal polynomials of Bernstein-Szeg\"o type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05545v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of weight functions on $[-1,1]$, which are special cases of the general weights studied by Bernstein and Szeg\"o, as well as their extentions to the interval $[-a,1]$ for a continuous parameter $a&gt;0$. These weights are parametrized by two positive integers. As these integers tend to infinity, these weights approximate certain weight functions on $\mathbb{R}$ considered in the earlier literature in connection with orthogonal polynomials related to elliptic functions. It turns out that an orthogonal polynomial of certain degree corresponding to these weights has a particularly simple form with known roots. This fact allows us to find explicit quadrature formulas for these weights and construct measures on $\mathbb{R}$ with identical moments. We also find finite analogs of some improper integrals first studied by Glaisher and Ramanujan, and show that some of the functions used in this work are in fact generating functions of certain finite trigonometric power sums.</description>

      <title>Curved Kakeya sets for generic phases in odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for each odd integer $n\ge 3$, there is an open dense subset of H\"ormander phase functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which the associated curved Kakeya sets have Hausdorff dimension at least $\frac{n+1}{2} + d_n$ for some positive $d_n$, thereby exceeding the classical compression threshold. In particular, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, generic H\"ormander phases induce curved Kakeya sets of dimension at least $2 + \tfrac17$. As an application, on a generic three-dimensional Riemannian manifold, a local Nikodym set has Hausdorff dimension at least $2 + \tfrac17$. We achieve these results by generalizing the finite contact order condition from Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang, originally developed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, to arbitrary dimensions. Our bounds are stronger than those of Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang even in $\mathbb{R}^3$, since we derive curved Kakeya estimates directly via the polynomial method. Moreover, for H\"ormander-type oscillatory integral operators with positive-definite phases of finite contact order, we obtain quantitative improvements in all odd dimensions over the bounds of Guth--Hickman--Iliopoulou, while in three dimensions our oscillatory integral estimate exactly matches the result of Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.08469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations for functionals of a large class of spin models and strongly correlated random point fields, achieving near-optimal rates. For spin models, we demonstrate Gaussian asymptotics for the magnetization for a wide class of ferromagnetic spin systems on Euclidean lattices, in particular those with continuous spins. Specific applications include, in particular, the celebrated XY and Heisenberg models under ferromagnetic conditions, and more broadly, systems with very general rotationally invariant spins in arbitrary dimensions. We address both the setting of free boundary conditions and a large class of ferromagnetic boundary conditions, and our CLTs are endowed with near-optimal rate. Our approach leverages the classical Lee-Yang theory for the zeros of partition functions, and subsumes as a special case results of Lebowitz, Ruelle, Pittel and Speer on CLTs in discrete statistical mechanical models for which we obtain sharper convergence rates. In a different direction, we obtain CLTs for linear statistics of a wide class of point processes known as $\alpha$-determinantal point processes which interpolate between negatively and positively associated random point fields. We contribute a unified approach to CLTs in such models; significantly, our approach is able to analyse such processes in dimensions $\ge 3$, where structural alternatives such as connections to random matrix theory are not available. A key ingredient of our approach is a broad, quantitative extension of the classical Marcinkiewicz Theorem that holds under the limited condition that the characteristic function is non-vanishing only on a bounded disk. In spite of the general applicability of the results, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up to a log factor.</description>

      <title>Analytic Hardy fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that maximal analytic Hardy fields are $\eta_1$ in the sense of Hausdorff. We also prove various embedding theorems about analytic Hardy fields. For example, the ordered differential field $\mathbb T$ of transseries is shown to be isomorphic to an analytic Hardy field.</description>

      <title>An existence and uniqueness result to evolution equations with sign-changing pseudo-differential operators and its applications to logarithmic Laplacian operators and second-order differential operators without ellipticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We broaden the domain of the Fourier transform to contain all distributions without using the Paley-Wiener theorem and devise a new weak formulation built upon this extension. This formulation is applicable to evolution equations involving pseudo-differential operators, even when the signs of their symbols may vary over time. Notably, our main operator includes the logarithmic Laplacian operator $\log (-\Delta)$ and a second-order differential operator whose leading coefficients are not positive semi-definite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to unify the theory of weights beyond the setting of weighted Lebesgue spaces in the general setting of quasi-Banach function spaces. We prove new characterizations for the boundedness of singular integrals, pose several conjectures, and prove partial results related to the duality of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. Furthermore, we give an overview of the theory applied to weighted variable Lebesgue, Morrey, and Musielak-Orlicz spaces.</description>

      <title>Stability of axial free-boundary hyperplanes in circular cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an axially-symmetric, $(n+1)$-dimensional convex cone $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we study the stability of the free-boundary minimal surface $\Sigma$ obtained by intersecting $\Omega$ with a $n$-plane that contains the axis of $\Omega$. In the case $n=2$, $\Sigma$ is always unstable, as a special case of the vertex-skipping property that we recently proved in another article. Conversely, as soon as $n \ge 3$ and $\Omega$ has a sufficiently large aperture (depending on the dimension $n$), we show that $\Sigma$ is strictly stable. For our stability analysis, we introduce a Lipschitz flow $\Sigma_{t}[f]$ of deformations of $\Sigma$ associated with a compactly-supported, scalar deformation field $f$, which satisfies the key property $\partial \Sigma_{t}[f] \subset \partial \Omega$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$. Then, we compute the lower-right second variation of the area of $\Sigma$ along the flow, and ultimately show that it is positive by exploiting its connection with a functional inequality studied in the context of reaction-diffusion problems.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the commutation relations between the Gauss--Weierstrass semigroup and monomial weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the commutation relations between the Gauss--Weierstrass semigroup on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, generated by convolution with the complex Gaussian kernel, and monomial weights. We provide an explicit representation and a sharper estimate of the commutation relations with more concise proofs than those in previous works.</description>

      <title>Strichartz and local smoothing estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger equations over fractal time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain Strichartz-type estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger operator $f \mapsto e^{it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}} f$ over a time set $E$ of fractal dimension. To obtain those estimates capturing fractal nature of $E$, we employ the notions in the spirit of the Assouad dimension, such as, bounded Assouad characteristic and Assouad specturm. We also prove the estimate $$ \| e^{it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}} f \|_{L_t^q(\mathrm{d}\mu; L_x^r(\mathbb{R}^d))} \le C \|f\|_{H^s}, $$ where $\mu$ is a measure satisfying an $\alpha$-dimensional growth condition. In addition, we establish related inhomogeneous estimates and $L^2$ local smoothing estimates. A surprising feature of our work is that, despite dealing with rough fractal sets, we extend the known estimates for the fractional Schr\"odinger operators in a natural way, precisely consistent with the associated fractal dimensions.</description>
