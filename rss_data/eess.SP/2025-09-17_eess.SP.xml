      <title>FAS-ARIS: Turning Multipath Challenges Into Localization Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) systems face fundamental limitations in achieving accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization due to limited spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) and the adverse impact of multipath propagation. This paper proposes a novel fluid antenna system (FAS)-active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) framework that transforms multipath effects from a hindrance into a resource for enhanced localization. By synergistically combining the signal amplification capabilities of ARIS with the spatial diversity enabled by FAS, the proposed system achieves robust 3D user equipment (UE) positioning -- without relying on auxiliary information such as time-of-arrival (ToA) or frequency diversity. The system exploits both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components through a tailored signal decoupling strategy. We design novel UE pilot sequences and ARIS phase configurations to effectively separate LoS and NLoS channels, enabling independent parameter estimation. A multi-stage estimation algorithm is then applied: the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm estimates angle-of-arrival (AoA) from the direct path, while maximum likelihood estimation with interior-point refinement recovers cascaded channel parameters from the reflected path. Finally, geometric triangulation using least-squares estimation determines the UE's 3D position based on the extracted AoA information. Comprehensive performance analysis, including the derivation of Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds for both channel and position estimation, establishes theoretical benchmarks. Simulation results confirm that the proposed FAS-ARIS framework achieves near-optimal localization accuracy while maintaining robustness in rich multipath environments -- effectively turning conventional localization challenges into advantages.</description>

      <title>Partial Secrecy Analysis in Wireless Systems: Diversity-Enhanced PLS over Generalized Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securing information in future mobile networks is challenging, especially for devices with limited computational resources. Physical layer security (PLS) offers a viable solution by leveraging wireless channel randomness. When full secrecy is unattainable, the partial secrecy regime provides a realistic alternative. This work analyzes partial secrecy performance under the generalized multicluster fluctuating two-ray (MFTR) fading model, which subsumes many classical fading cases. We study a system with a transmitter (A), legitimate receiver (B), and eavesdropper (E), both B and E using antenna arrays with maximal ratio combining (MRC), under i.n.i.d. fading. Exact and closed-form approximations are derived for key secrecy metrics: generalized secrecy outage probability (GSOP), average fractional equivocation (AFE), and average information leakage rate (AILR). The results, validated by Monte Carlo simulations, retain constant complexity regardless of diversity order. The MFTR model's flexibility enables comprehensive assessment across fading conditions, showing that more MRC branches at B enhance secrecy performance depending on the A-E link characteristics.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised and Topological Signal-Quality Assessment for Any PPG Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) is embedded in billions of devices, yet its optical waveform is easily corrupted by motion, perfusion loss, and ambient light, jeopardizing downstream cardiometric analytics. Existing signal-quality assessment (SQA) methods rely either on brittle heuristics or on data-hungry supervised models. We introduce the first fully unsupervised SQA pipeline for wrist PPG. Stage 1 trains a contrastive 1-D ResNet-18 on 276 h of raw, unlabeled data from heterogeneous sources (varying in device and sampling frequency), yielding optical-emitter- and motion-invariant embeddings (i.e., the learned representation is stable across differences in LED wavelength, drive intensity, and device optics, as well as wrist motion). Stage 2 converts each 512-D encoder embedding into a 4-D topological signature via persistent homology (PH) and clusters these signatures with HDBSCAN. To produce a binary signal-quality index (SQI), the acceptable PPG signals are represented by the densest cluster while the remaining clusters are assumed to mainly contain poor-quality PPG signals. Without re-tuning, the SQI attains Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz scores of 0.72, 0.34, and 6173, respectively, on a stratified sample of 10,000 windows. In this study, we propose a hybrid self-supervised-learning--topological-data-analysis (SSL--TDA) framework that offers a drop-in, scalable, cross-device quality gate for PPG signals.</description>

      <title>Rapid Adaptation of SpO2 Estimation to Wearable Devices via Transfer Learning on Low-Sampling-Rate PPG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) is a vital marker for healthcare monitoring. Traditional SpO2 estimation methods often rely on complex clinical calibration, making them unsuitable for low-power, wearable applications. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based framework for the rapid adaptation of SpO2 estimation to energy-efficient wearable devices using low-sampling-rate (25Hz) dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG). We first pretrain a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model with self-attention on a public clinical dataset, then fine-tune it using data collected from our wearable We-Be band and an FDA-approved reference pulse oximeter. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.967% on the public dataset and 2.624% on the private dataset, significantly outperforming traditional calibration and non-transferred machine learning baselines. Moreover, using 25Hz PPG reduces power consumption by 40% compared to 100Hz, excluding baseline draw. Our method also attains an MAE of 3.284% in instantaneous SpO2 prediction, effectively capturing rapid fluctuations. These results demonstrate the rapid adaptation of accurate, low-power SpO2 monitoring on wearable devices without the need for clinical calibration.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Blood Pressure Estimation from Multi-Wavelength PPG Using Curriculum-Adversarial Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and generalizable blood pressure (BP) estimation is vital for the early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we enforce subject-level data splitting on a public multi-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) dataset and propose a generalizable BP estimation framework based on curriculum-adversarial learning. Our approach combines curriculum learning, which transitions from hypertension classification to BP regression, with domain-adversarial training that confuses subject identity to encourage the learning of subject-invariant features. Experiments show that multi-channel fusion consistently outperforms single-channel models. On the four-wavelength PPG dataset, our method achieves strong performance under strict subject-level splitting, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 14.2mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.4mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Additionally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of both the curriculum and adversarial components. These results highlight the potential of leveraging complementary information in multi-wavelength PPG and curriculum-adversarial strategies for accurate and robust BP estimation.</description>

      <title>Kalman Filtering of Stationary Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel definition of stationary graph signals, formulated with respect to a symmetric graph shift, such as the graph Laplacian. We show that stationary graph signals can be generated by transmitting white noise through polynomial graph channels, and that their stationarity is preserved under polynomial channel transmission.
  In this paper, we also investigate Kalman filtering to dynamical systems characterized by polynomial state and observation matrices. We demonstrate that Kalman filtering maintains the stationarity of graph signals, while effectively incorporating both system dynamics and noise structure. In comparison to the static inverse filtering method and naive zero-signal strategy, the Kalman filtering procedure yields more accurate and adaptive signal estimates, highlighting its robustness and versatility in graph signal processing.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion for BS-UE Cooperative MIMO-OFDM ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technique for expanding the functionalities of wireless networks with enhanced spectral efficiency. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined six basic sensing operation modes in wireless networks. To further enhance the sensing capability of wireless networks, this paper proposes a new sensing operation mode, i.e., the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) cooperative sensing. Specifically, after decoding the communication data, the UE further processes the received signal to extract the target sensing information. We propose an efficient algorithm for fusing the sensing results obtained by the BS and UE, by exploiting the geometric relationship among BS, UE and targets as well as the expected sensing quality in the BS monostatic and BS-UE bistatic sensing. The results show that the proposed data fusion method for cooperative sensing can effectively improve the position and velocity estimation accuracy of multiple targets, and provide a new approach on the expansion of the sensing pattern.</description>

      <title>Sustainable LSTM-Based Precoding for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Low-Altitude UAV Tracking via Sensing-Assisted Predictive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted predictive beamforming, as one of the enabling technologies for emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm, shows significant promise for enhancing various future unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. However, current works predominately emphasized on spectral efficiency enhancement, while the impact of such beamforming techniques on the communication reliability was largely unexplored and challenging to characterize. To fill this research gap and tackle this issue, this paper investigates outage capacity maximization for UAV tracking under the sensing-assisted predictive beamforming scheme. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV tracking scheme is proposed leveraging extended Kalman filtering (EKF), where the predicted UAV trajectory, sensing duration ratio, and target constant received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are jointly optimized to maximize the outage capacity at each time slot. To address the implicit nature of the objective function, closed-form approximations of the outage probabilities (OPs) at both prediction and measurement stages of each time slot are proposed based on second-order Taylor expansions, providing an efficient and full characterization of outage capacity. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is proposed based on a combination of bisection search and successive convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convex optimization problem with guaranteed convergence. To further reduce computational complexity, a second efficient algorithm is developed based on alternating optimization (AO). Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived OP approximations, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the significant outage capacity enhancement over various benchmarks, while also indicating a trade-off between decreasing path loss and enjoying wide beam coverage for outage capacity maximization.</description>

      <title>NEFT: A Unified Transformer Framework for Efficient Near-Field CSI Feedback in XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, operating in the near-field region due to their massive antenna arrays, are a key enabler of next-generation wireless communications but face significant challenges in channel state information (CSI) feedback. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool by learning compact CSI representations for feedback. However, existing methods struggle to capture the intricate structure of near-field CSI while incurring prohibitive computational overhead on practical mobile devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Near-Field Efficient Feedback Transformer (NEFT) family for accurate and efficient near-field CSI feedback across diverse hardware platforms. Built on a hierarchical Vision Transformer backbone, NEFT is extended with lightweight variants to meet various deployment constraints: NEFT-Compact applies multi-level knowledge distillation (KD) to reduce complexity while maintaining accuracy, and NEFT-Hybrid and NEFT-Edge address encoder- and edge-constrained scenarios via attention-free encoding and KD. Extensive simulations show that NEFT achieves a 15--21 dB improvement in normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) over state-of-the-art methods, while NEFT-Compact and NEFT-Edge reduce total FLOPs by 25--36% with negligible accuracy loss. Moreover, NEFT-Hybrid lowers encoder-side complexity by up to 64%, enabling deployment in highly asymmetric device scenarios. These results establish NEFT as a practical and scalable solution for near-field CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>EMC Limit Level Guidelines for In-System Interference with GPS Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12770v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because GPS signals are weak, electronic systems and components that are placed near GPS receivers can easily cause disruptive electromagnetic interference through their unintended radiated emissions. In this paper, EMC limit level guidelines are presented for electronics that are intended to be placed near to GPS receivers, as often happens in automotive and other applications. One of the challenges of defining limit-levels for systems intended to be integrated with GPS receivers is that the impact of noise at the input of the receiver may vary substantially depending on the form of the noise due to the correlator function implemented by GPS receiver. The quality of the correlated signal is typically represented using the carrier-to-noise ratio ($C / N_0$). A theoretical model predicting the degredation of the carrier-to-noise ratio with radio frequency interference is presented in this paper and is validated with realistic noise sources. The model is then used to develop guidelines to assess the impact of unintended emissions from electronic devices on nearby GPS receivers based on the frequency, bandwidth, and magnitude of the noise. These guidelines provide a more nuanced method of evaluating emissions than simple limit lines that are used by many emissions standards.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Benchmark for Diffusion Posterior Sampling Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a statistical benchmark for diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) algorithms for Bayesian linear inverse problems. The benchmark synthesizes signals from sparse L\'evy-process priors whose posteriors admit efficient Gibbs methods. These Gibbs methods can be used to obtain gold-standard posterior samples that can be compared to the samples obtained by the DPS algorithms. By using the Gibbs methods for the resolution of the denoising problems in the reverse diffusion, the framework also isolates the error that arises from the approximations to the likelihood score. We instantiate the benchmark with the minimum-mean-squared-error optimality gap and posterior coverage tests and provide numerical experiments for popular DPS algorithms on the inverse problems of denoising, deconvolution, imputation, and reconstruction from partial Fourier measurements. We release the benchmark code at https://github.com/zacmar/dps-benchmark. The repository exposes simple plug-in interfaces, reference scripts, and config-driven runs so that new algorithms can be added and evaluated with minimal effort. We invite researchers to contribute and report results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Signal Separation via Plug-and-Play Diffusion-Within-Gibbs Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a posterior sampling algorithm for the problem of estimating multiple independent source signals from their noisy superposition. The proposed algorithm is a combination of Gibbs sampling method and plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors. Unlike most existing diffusion-model-based approaches for signal separation, our method allows source priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Moreover, under the assumption of perfect diffusion model training, the proposed method provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. Experiments on the task of heartbeat extraction from mixtures with synthetic motion artifacts demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards personalized, precise and survey-free environment recognition: AI-enhanced sensor fusion without pre-deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and personalized environment recognition is essential for seamless indoor positioning and optimized connectivity, yet traditional fingerprinting requires costly site surveys and lacks user-level adaptation. We present a survey-free, on-device sensor-fusion framework that builds a personalized, lightweight multi-source fingerprint (FP) database from pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), WiFi/cellular, GNSS, and interaction time tags. Matching is performed by an AI-enhanced dynamic time warping module (AIDTW) that aligns noisy, asynchronous sequences. To turn perception into continually improving actions, a cloud-edge online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) loop aggregates desensitized summaries and human feedback in the cloud to optimize a policy via proximal policy optimization (PPO), and periodically distills updates to devices. Across indoor/outdoor scenarios, our system reduces network-transition latency (measured by time-to-switch, TTS) by 32-65% in daily environments compared with conventional baselines, without site-specific pre-deployment.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Backscatter Networks for Integrated Communications and RF Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and theoretical foundation for next-generation backscatter networks that move beyond communication and integrate RF location sensing capabilities. An end-to-end system model for wideband OFDM backscatter systems is derived, including detailed characterization of propagation channels, receiver chain impairments, RF tag operation, and unsynchronized network nodes. The theoretical system model is validated through experimental evaluation using actual hardware, demonstrating the detailed model's accuracy. A practical bistatic ranging method that can operate with unsynchronized nodes is presented, along with the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) derived to show the achievable performance limits. Our experimental results demonstrate the system performance for communication, RF sensing, and ranging, while also benchmarking against the derived theoretical limits. This analytical framework and experimental validation establish fundamental understanding of distributed, unsynchronized backscatter systems for future machine-type communication networks that are deployed in massive scale, while remaining energy-efficient.</description>

      <title>Difference-Based Recovery for Modulo Sampling: Tightened Bounds and Robustness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) clip when signals exceed their input range. Modulo (unlimited) sampling overcomes this limitation by folding the signal before digitization, but existing recovery methods are either computationally intensive or constrained by loose oversampling bounds that demand high sampling rates. In addition, none account for sampling jitter, which is unavoidable in practice. This paper revisits difference-based recovery and establishes new theoretical and practical guarantees. In the noiseless setting, we prove that arbitrarily high difference order reduces the sufficient oversampling factor from $2\pi e$ to $\pi$, substantially tightening classical bounds. For fixed order $N$, we derive a noise-aware sampling condition that guarantees stable recovery. For second-order difference-based recovery ($N=2$), we further extend the analysis to non-uniform sampling, proving robustness under bounded jitter. An FPGA-based hardware prototype demonstrates reliable reconstruction with amplitude expansion up to $\rho = 108$, confirming the feasibility of high-performance unlimited sensing with a simple and robust recovery pipeline.</description>

      <title>RF-Powered Batteryless Plant Movement Sensor for Precision Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision agriculture demands non-invasive, energy-efficient, and sustainable plant monitoring solutions. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a lightweight, batteryless plant movement sensor powered solely by RF energy. This sensor targets Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and utilizes inertial measurements units (IMUs) to monitor leaf motion, which correlates with plant physiological responses to environmental stress. By eliminating the battery, we reduce the ecological footprint, weight, and maintenance requirements, transitioning from lifetime-based to operation-based energy storage. Our design minimizes circuit complexity while enabling flexible, adaptive readout scheduling based on energy availability and sensor data. We detail the energy requirements, RF power transfer considerations, integration constraints, and outline future directions, including multi-antenna power delivery and networked sensor synchronization.</description>

      <title>Deep Tensor Learning for Reliable Channel Charting from Incomplete and Noisy Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel charting has emerged as a powerful tool for user equipment localization and wireless environment sensing. Its efficacy lies in mapping high-dimensional channel data into low-dimensional features that preserve the relative similarities of the original data. However, existing channel charting methods are largely developed using simulated or indoor measurements, often assuming clean and complete channel data across all frequency bands. In contrast, real-world channels collected from base stations are typically incomplete due to frequency hopping and are significantly noisy, particularly at cell edges. These challenging conditions greatly degrade the performance of current methods. To address this, we propose a deep tensor learning method that leverages the inherent tensor structure of wireless channels to effectively extract informative while low-dimensional features (i.e., channel charts) from noisy and incomplete measurements. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in these challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scatterer Localization Using Multi-Bounce Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor sensing is challenging because of the multi-bounce effect, spherical wavefront, and spatial nonstationarity (SNS) of the near-field effect. This paper addresses radio-based environment sensing considering these issues. Specifically, graph theory (GT) is used to model the multi-bounce propagation of the near field. In this manner, indoor reflectors/scatterers are modeled as vertices in a propagation graph, the multi-bounce paths are modeled by the edges linking the vertices. Besides, the coupled multipath parameters in the near field, i.e., range and angles, are denoted directly by the coordinates of vertices. Then, the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is adapted to the proposed Graph theory-based dictionary-aided Multi-bounce SAGE (GM-SAGE), where the searching parameters including range and angle of departure/arrival (AoD/AoA) are transformed to the coordinates of scatterers in the graph. The proposed algorithm is validated through measurement-calibrated ray tracing (RT) in a complex indoor office. The results demonstrate that the proposed GM-SAGE can deal with multi-bounce channels.</description>

      <title>Transmitter Subspace-Aware Target Detection in Two-Channel Passive Radars with Inter-Receiver Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address target detection in a single Delay-Doppler cell using spatially distributed two-channel passive radars. An unknown illuminator of opportunity (IO) is assumed to emit a waveform lying in a known low-dimensional subspace (e.g., OFDM). Each receiver transforms its reference and surveillance signals onto the IO subspace after noise-whitening, to obtain cross-correlation (CC) measurements. To save bandwidth, receivers collaboratively exchange and linearly combine the CC output, and only a subset transmits them to a fusion center (FC) over a multiple-access channel (MAC). Collaboration weights are designed using the moments of the FC measurement to enhance detection performance.</description>

      <title>Scalable RF Simulation in Generative 4D Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However, collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.</description>

      <title>Power-Dominance in Estimation Theory: A Third Pathological Axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation theory by introducing a second-order diagnostic for estimator design. While classical analysis focuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational constraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for both parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power regimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the `power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty, making it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a `safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps. One map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating characteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone corresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden `power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This framework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing new theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design philosophies.</description>

      <title>Moir\'eTac: A Dual-Mode Visuotactile Sensor for Multidimensional Perception Using Moir\'e Pattern Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visuotactile sensors typically employ sparse marker arrays that limit spatial resolution and lack clear analytical force-to-image relationships. To solve this problem, we present \textbf{Moir\'eTac}, a dual-mode sensor that generates dense interference patterns via overlapping micro-gratings within a transparent architecture. When two gratings overlap with misalignment, they create moir\'e patterns that amplify microscopic deformations. The design preserves optical clarity for vision tasks while producing continuous moir\'e fields for tactile sensing, enabling simultaneous 6-axis force/torque measurement, contact localization, and visual perception. We combine physics-based features (brightness, phase gradient, orientation, and period) from moir\'e patterns with deep spatial features. These are mapped to 6-axis force/torque measurements, enabling interpretable regression through end-to-end learning. Experimental results demonstrate three capabilities: force/torque measurement with R^2 &gt; 0.98 across tested axes; sensitivity tuning through geometric parameters (threefold gain adjustment); and vision functionality for object classification despite moir\'e overlay. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic arm for cap removal with coordinated force and torque control, validating its potential for dexterous manipulation.</description>

      <title>Soft Gradient Boosting with Learnable Feature Transforms for Sequential Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for semidefinite least squares based on data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD) constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.</description>

      <title>CoVariance Filters and Neural Networks over Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13178v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs) as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bayesian Beamforming for Imaging by Marginalizing the Speed of Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging methods based on array signal processing often require a fixed propagation speed of the medium, or speed of sound (SoS) for methods based on acoustic signals. The resolution of the images formed using these methods is strongly affected by the assumed SoS, which, due to multipath, nonlinear propagation, and non-uniform mediums, is challenging at best to select. In this letter, we propose a Bayesian approach to marginalize the influence of the SoS on beamformers for imaging. We adapt Bayesian direction-of-arrival estimation to an imaging setting and integrate a popular minimum variance beamformer over the posterior of the SoS. To solve the Bayesian integral efficiently, we use numerical Gauss quadrature. We apply our beamforming approach to shallow water sonar imaging where multipath and nonlinear propagation is abundant. We compare against the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer and demonstrate that its Bayesian counterpart achieves improved range and azimuthal resolution while effectively suppressing multipath artifacts.</description>

      <title>SuPreME: A Supervised Pre-training Framework for Multimodal ECG Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming Design for Pinching Antenna-assisted Symbiotic Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07002v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio framework enabled by the pinching antenna system (PASS), designed to enhance both primary and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. This reconfigurability introduces additional degrees of freedom for adaptive pinching beamforming, thereby enabling constructive signal enhancement and interference suppression tailored to the locations of the backscatter device, the Internet of Things (IoT) receiver, and the primary receivers. To fully exploit these benefits, we formulate a joint transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem that maximizes the achievable sum rate while satisfying the IoT receiver's detection error probability constraint and feasible deployment constraints for the pinching antennas. The resulting problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address this challenge, we develop two complementary solution approaches. The first is a learning-aided gradient descent method, where the constrained optimization is reformulated into a differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning. In this approach, the pinching antenna position matrix is reparameterized to automatically satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. The second approach is an optimization-based successive convex approximation-particle swarm optimization method, which first determines the transmit beamforming solution using successive convex approximation and subsequently optimizes pinching beamforming via a particle swarm optimization search over candidate pinching antenna placements.</description>

      <title>Robust Recursive Fusion of Multiresolution Multispectral Images with Location-Aware Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiresolution image fusion is a key problem for real-time satellite imaging and plays a central role in detecting and monitoring natural phenomena such as floods. It aims to solve the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution in remote sensing instruments. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this problem, the presence of outliers such as clouds downgrades their performance. Moreover, strategies that integrate robustness, recursive operation and learned models are missing. In this paper, a robust recursive image fusion framework leveraging location-aware neural networks (NN) to model the image dynamics is proposed. Outliers are modeled by representing the probability of contamination of a given pixel and band. A NN model trained on a small dataset provides accurate predictions of the stochastic image time evolution, which improves both the accuracy and robustness of the method. A recursive solution is proposed to estimate the high-resolution images using a Bayesian variational inference framework. Experiments fusing images from the Landsat 8 and MODIS instruments show that the proposed approach is significantly more robust against cloud cover, without losing performance when no clouds are present.</description>

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), which integrate multiple programmable metasurface layers, have recently emerged as a promising technology for advanced wave-domain signal processing. SIMs benefit from flexible spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) while reducing the requirement for costly radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, current state-of-the-art SIM designs face challenges such as complex phase shift optimization and energy attenuation from multiple layers. To address these aspects, we propose incorporating meta-fibers into SIMs, with the aim of reducing the number of layers and enhancing the energy efficiency. First, we introduce a meta-fiber-connected 2-layer SIM that exhibits the same flexible signal processing capabilities as conventional multi-layer structures, and explains the operating principle. Subsequently, we formulate and solve the optimization problem of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the SIM channel and the desired channel matrices. Specifically, by designing the phase shifts of the meta-atoms associated with the transmitting-SIM and receiving-SIM, a non-interference system with parallel subchannels is established. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a closed-form expression for each phase shift at each iteration of an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. We show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to conventional multi-layer SIMs. The channel capacity bound and computational complexity are analyzed to provide design insights. Finally, numerical results are illustrated, demonstrating that the proposed two-layer SIM with meta-fiber achieves over a 25% improvement in channel capacity while reducing the total number of meta-atoms by 59% as compared with a conventional seven-layer SIM.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Defense Against Coordinated Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Robust Constrained Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern power systems face increasing vulnerability to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks beyond traditional N-1 contingency frameworks. Existing security paradigms face a critical bottleneck: efficiently identifying worst-case scenarios and rapidly coordinating defensive responses are hindered by intensive computation and time delays, during which cascading failures can propagate. This paper presents a novel tri-level robust constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) framework for robust power system security. The framework generates diverse system states through AC-OPF formulations, identifies worst-case N-K attack scenarios for each state, and trains policies to mitigate these scenarios across all operating conditions without requiring predefined attack patterns. The framework addresses constraint satisfaction through Beta-blending projection-based feasible action mapping techniques during training and primal-dual augmented Lagrangian optimization for deployment. Once trained, the RCRL policy learns how to control observed cyber-physical attacks in real time. Validation on IEEE benchmark systems demonstrates effectiveness against coordinated N-K attacks, causing widespread cascading failures throughout the network. The learned policy can successfully respond rapidly to recover system-wide constraints back to normal within 0.21 ms inference times, establishing superior resilience for critical infrastructure protection.</description>
