      <title>Thermal effects on sound velocity peak and conformality in isospin QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermal effects on equations of state (EOS) in isospin QCD, utilizing a quark-meson model coupled to a Polyakov loop. The quark-meson model is analyzed at one-loop that is the minimal order to include quark substructure constraints on pions which condense at finite isospin density. In the previous study we showed that the quark-meson model at zero temperature produces the sound velocity peak and the negative trace anomaly in the domain between the chiral effective theory regime at low density and the perturbative QCD regime at high density, in reasonable agreement with lattice simulations. We now include thermal effects from quarks in the Polyakov loop background and examine EOS, especially the sound velocity and trace anomaly along isentropic trajectories. At large isospin density, there are three temperature windows; (i) the pion condensed region with almost vanishing Polyakov loops, (ii) the pion condensed region with finite Polyakov loops, and (iii) the quark gas without pion condensates. In the domain (i), the gap associated with the pion condensate strongly quenches thermal excitations. As the system approaches the domain (ii), thermal quarks, which behave as non-relativistic particles, add energy density but little pressure, substantially reducing the sound velocity to the value less than the conformal value while increasing the trace anomaly toward the positive value. Approaching the domain (iii), thermal quarks become more relativistic as pion condensates melt, increasing sound velocity toward the conformal limit. Corrections from thermal pions are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>On the computation of lattice sums without translational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a framework for the efficient computation of oscillatory multidimensional lattice sums in geometries with boundaries, a problem intersecting pure and applied mathematics with immediate applications in condensed matter physics and topological quantum physics. The challenge in evaluating the arising sums results from the combination of singular long-range interactions with the loss of translational invariance caused by the boundaries, rendering standard tools ineffective. Our work shows that these lattice sums can be generated from a generalization of the Riemann zeta function to multidimensional non-periodic lattice sums. We put forth a new representation of this zeta function together with a numerical algorithm that ensures super-exponential convergence across an extensive range of geometries. Notably, our method's runtime is influenced only by the complexity of the considered geometries and not by the sheer number of particles, providing the foundation for efficient simulations of macroscopic condensed matter systems. We showcase the practical utility of our method by computing interaction energies in a three-dimensional crystal structure with $3\times 10^{23}$ particles. Our method's accuracy is thoroughly assessed through a detailed error analysis that both uses analytical results and numerical experiments. A reference implementation is provided online along with the article</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in axion electrodynamics with lattice regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is induced by the interplay between photon fields and boundary conditions, and in particular, photon fields modified in axion electrodynamics may lead to the sign-flipping of the Casimir energy. We propose a theoretical approach to derive the Casimir effect in axion electrodynamics. This approach is based on a lattice regularization and enables us to discuss the dependence on the lattice spacing for the Casimir energy. With this approach, the sign-flipping behavior of the Casimir energy is correctly reproduced. By taking the continuum limit of physical quantity calculated on the lattice, we can obtain the results consistent with the continuum theory. This approach can also be applied to the Casimir effect at nonzero temperature.</description>
