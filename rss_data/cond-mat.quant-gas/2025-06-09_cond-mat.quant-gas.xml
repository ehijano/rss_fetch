      <title>Dynamical Phase Transition of Dissipative Fermionic Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative open quantum many-body systems exhibit rich phases that are characterized by the steady states in the long-time dynamics. However, lossy open systems inevitably decay to the vacuum, making their transient evolution the primary focus. Assuming the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov ansatz, we derive a generalized time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equation based on the least action principle for open quantum systems. By solving the quench dynamics after abruptly introducing inelastic scattering or one-body loss in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer limit, we reveal a generic dynamical phase transition: the superfluid order parameter vanishes non-analytically while the superfluid fraction's first-order time derivative undergoes a discontinuous change at a finite critical time. This marks a new paradigm of dynamical phase transitions, distinct from those in closed systems, where the initial state must be finely tuned.</description>

      <title>Tilt-Induced Localization in Interacting Bose-Einstein Condensates for Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate localization transitions in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in tilted optical lattices, focusing on both the continuum limit accessed via shallow lattice depths and the tight-binding limit realized in the deep lattice regime. Utilizing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the many-body Bose-Hubbard model, we analyze the scaling behavior of localization indicators, such as the root mean square width and fidelity susceptibility, as a function of the applied tilt. Our results reveal clear signatures of a localization-delocalization transition driven by the linear potential, with scaling properties that characterize criticality even in the presence of interactions within the GPE description. Despite the single-mode nature of the condensate wavefunction, we demonstrate that it can effectively probe quantum criticality. Building on this, we propose the use of interacting BECs in tilted lattices as a platform for quantum critical sensing, where the condensate wavefunction serves both as a sensitive probe of localization and a practical resource for quantum-enhanced metrology. This approach opens new avenues for precision gradient sensing based on localization phenomena in bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature entanglement and coherence in asymmetric bosonic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature properties of a bosonic Josephson junction composed of N interacting atoms confined by a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential, modeled by the two-site Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compute numerically the spectral decomposition of the statistical ensemble of states, the thermodynamic and entanglement entropies, the population imbalance, the quantum Fisher information, and the coherence visibility. We analyze their dependence on the system parameters, showing in particular how finite temperature and on-site energy asymmetry affect the entanglement and coherence properties of the system. Moreover, starting from a quantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of interactions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime, where thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann weight involving an effective temperature. We discuss the possibility of applying this effective description to other models in suitable regimes.</description>

      <title>Emergent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless deconfinement in super-Coulombic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional "super-Coulombic" plasmas, namely, neutral plasmas with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulomb. To that end, we employ numerically exact large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to naive energy-entropy arguments, we observe a charge confinement-deconfinement transition as a function of temperature. Remarkably, the transition lies in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class. Our results corroborate recent dielectric medium and renormalization group calculations predicting effective long-scale Coulomb interactions in microscopically super-Coulombic gases. We explicitly showcase this novel dielectric screening phenomenon, capturing the emergent Coulomb potential and the associated crossover length scale. This is achieved by utilizing a new test charge based methodology for determining effective inter-particle interactions. Lastly, we show that this Coulomb emergence and the associated BKT transition occur universally across generic interactions and densities.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</description>

      <title>Fast manipulation of a quantum gas on an atom chip with a strong microwave field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental platform based on an atom chip encompassing a coplanar waveguide which enables the manipulation of a quantum gas of sodium atoms with strong microwave fields. We describe the production with this setup of a very elongated degenerate quantum gas with typically 10^6 atoms, that can be prepared all along the cross-over from the three-dimensional to the one-dimensional regime, depending on the atom number and trapping geometry. Using the microwave field radiated by the waveguide, we drive Rabi oscillations between the hyperfine ground states, with the atoms trapped at various distances from the waveguide. At the closest position explored, the field amplitude exceeds 5 G, corresponding to a Rabi frequency on the strongest transition larger than 6 MHz. This enables fast manipulation of the atomic internal state.</description>

      <title>Engineering quantum droplet formation by cavity-induced long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a dilute Bose gas with both a short-range contact and an effective long-range interaction between the atoms. The latter is induced by the strong coupling to a cavity light mode and is spatially characterized by a periodic signature and a tunable envelope rooted in the pumping of the cavity. We formulate a Bogoliubov theory based on a homogeneous mean-field description and quantum fluctuations around it. The competition between the repulsive contact interaction and the long-range interaction allows the formation of self-bound quantum droplets. This generic approach is applied to two cavity setups, one without and one with a momentum-conserving effective long-range interaction between the atoms in the form of a driven dispersive cavity mode and a multimode cavity, respectively. For both cases we show analytically how the size and the central density of the cavity-induced quantum droplets depend on the contact interaction strength and on the shape of the spatial envelope of the long-range interaction.</description>

      <title>Third order corrections to the ground state energy of a Bose gas in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a translation invariant system of $N$ bosons in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, we establish a precise bound for the ground state energy $E_N$. While the leading, order $N$, contribution to $E_N$ has been known since [30,28] and the second order corrections (of order one) have been first determined in [5], our estimate also resolves the next term in the asymptotic expansion of $E_N$, which is of the order $(\log N) / N$.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable active steering protocols for genuinely entangled state manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 22 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.</description>
