      <title>Unsupervised CP-UNet Framework for Denoising DAS Data with Decay Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensor (DAS) technology leverages optical fiber cables to detect acoustic signals, providing cost-effective and dense monitoring capabilities. It offers several advantages including resistance to extreme conditions, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and accurate detection. However, DAS typically exhibits a lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) compared to geophones and is susceptible to various noise types, such as random noise, erratic noise, level noise, and long-period noise. This reduced S/N can negatively impact data analyses containing inversion and interpretation. While artificial intelligence has demonstrated excellent denoising capabilities, most existing methods rely on supervised learning with labeled data, which imposes stringent requirements on the quality of the labels. To address this issue, we develop a label-free unsupervised learning (UL) network model based on Context-Pyramid-UNet (CP-UNet) to suppress erratic and random noises in DAS data. The CP-UNet utilizes the Context Pyramid Module in the encoding and decoding process to extract features and reconstruct the DAS data. To enhance the connectivity between shallow and deep features, we add a Connected Module (CM) to both encoding and decoding section. Layer Normalization (LN) is utilized to replace the commonly employed Batch Normalization (BN), accelerating the convergence of the model and preventing gradient explosion during training. Huber-loss is adopted as our loss function whose parameters are experimentally determined. We apply the network to both the 2-D synthetic and filed data. Comparing to traditional denoising methods and the latest UL framework, our proposed method demonstrates superior noise reduction performance.</description>

      <title>MATS: An Audio Language Model under Text-only Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs), built upon powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable audio comprehension and reasoning capabilities. However, the training of LALMs demands a large corpus of audio-language pairs, which requires substantial costs in both data collection and training resources. In this paper, we propose MATS, an audio-language multimodal LLM designed to handle Multiple Audio task using solely Text-only Supervision. By leveraging pre-trained audio-language alignment models such as CLAP, we develop a text-only training strategy that projects the shared audio-language latent space into LLM latent space, endowing the LLM with audio comprehension capabilities without relying on audio data during training. To further bridge the modality gap between audio and language embeddings within CLAP, we propose the Strongly-related noisy text with audio (Santa) mechanism. Santa maps audio embeddings into CLAP language embedding space while preserving essential information from the audio input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATS, despite being trained exclusively on text data, achieves competitive performance compared to recent LALMs trained on large-scale audio-language pairs.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised classification of bird vocalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changes in bird populations can indicate broader changes in ecosystems, making birds one of the most important animal groups to monitor. Combining machine learning and passive acoustics enables continuous monitoring over extended periods without direct human involvement. However, most existing techniques require extensive expert-labeled datasets for training and cannot easily detect time-overlapping calls in busy soundscapes. We propose a semi-supervised acoustic bird detector designed to allow both the detection of time-overlapping calls (when separated in frequency) and the use of few labeled training samples. The classifier is trained and evaluated on a combination of community-recorded open-source data and long-duration soundscape recordings from Singapore. It achieves a mean F0.5 score of 0.701 across 315 classes from 110 bird species on a hold-out test set, with an average of 11 labeled training samples per class. It outperforms the state-of-the-art BirdNET classifier on a test set of 103 bird species despite significantly fewer labeled training samples. The detector is further tested on 144 microphone-hours of continuous soundscape data. The rich soundscape in Singapore makes suppression of false positives a challenge on raw, continuous data streams. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that achieving high precision in such environments with minimal labeled training data is possible.</description>

      <title>Audio-Based Classification of Insect Species Using Machine Learning Models: Cicada, Beetle, Termite, and Cricket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project addresses the challenge of classifying insect species: Cicada, Beetle, Termite, and Cricket using sound recordings. Accurate species identification is crucial for ecological monitoring and pest management. We employ machine learning models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to analyze audio features, including Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The potential novelty of this work lies in the combination of diverse audio features and machine learning models to tackle insect classification, specifically focusing on capturing subtle acoustic variations between species that have not been fully leveraged in previous research. The dataset is compiled from various open sources, and we anticipate achieving high classification accuracy, contributing to improved automated insect detection systems.</description>

      <title>TALKPLAY: Multimodal Music Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TalkPlay, a multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates the recommendation task as large language model token generation. TalkPlay represents music through an expanded token vocabulary that encodes multiple modalities - audio, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence. Using these rich representations, the model learns to generate recommendations through next-token prediction on music recommendation conversations, that requires learning the associations natural language query and response, as well as music items. In other words, the formulation transforms music recommendation into a natural language understanding task, where the model's ability to predict conversation tokens directly optimizes query-item relevance. Our approach eliminates traditional recommendation-dialogue pipeline complexity, enabling end-to-end learning of query-aware music recommendations. In the experiment, TalkPlay is successfully trained and outperforms baseline methods in various aspects, demonstrating strong context understanding as a conversational music recommender.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Audio-Visual Adversarial Vulnerability from Temporal and Modality Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While audio-visual learning equips models with a richer understanding of the real world by leveraging multiple sensory modalities, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial robustness of audio-visual models, considering both temporal and modality-specific vulnerabilities. We propose two powerful adversarial attacks: 1) a temporal invariance attack that exploits the inherent temporal redundancy across consecutive time segments and 2) a modality misalignment attack that introduces incongruence between the audio and visual modalities. These attacks are designed to thoroughly assess the robustness of audio-visual models against diverse threats. Furthermore, to defend against such attacks, we introduce a novel audio-visual adversarial training framework. This framework addresses key challenges in vanilla adversarial training by incorporating efficient adversarial perturbation crafting tailored to multi-modal data and an adversarial curriculum strategy. Extensive experiments in the Kinetics-Sounds dataset demonstrate that our proposed temporal and modality-based attacks in degrading model performance can achieve state-of-the-art performance, while our adversarial training defense largely improves the adversarial robustness as well as the adversarial training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Myna: Masking-Based Contrastive Learning of Musical Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Myna, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised musical representation learning. Built on a contrastive learning framework, Myna introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) on mel-spectrograms as the backbone and (2) a novel data augmentation strategy, token masking, that masks 90 percent of spectrogram tokens. These innovations deliver both effectiveness and efficiency: (i) Token masking enables a significant increase in per-GPU batch size, from 48 or 120 in prior methods (CLMR, MULE) to 4096. (ii) By avoiding traditional augmentations, Myna retains pitch sensitivity, enhancing performance in tasks like key detection. (iii) The use of vertical patches allows the model to better capture critical features for key detection. Our hybrid model, Myna-22M-Hybrid, processes both 16x16 and 128x2 patches, achieving state-of-the-art results. Trained on a single GPU, it outperforms MULE (62M) on average and rivals MERT-95M, which was trained on 16 and 64 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, it surpasses MERT-95M-public, establishing itself as the best-performing model trained on publicly available data. We release our code and models to promote reproducibility and facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding emotions is a fundamental aspect of human communication. Integrating audio and video signals offers a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states compared to traditional methods that rely on a single data source, such as speech or facial expressions. Despite its potential, multimodal emotion recognition faces significant challenges, particularly in synchronization, feature extraction, and fusion of diverse data sources. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based model named Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention (AVT-CA). The AVT-CA model employs a transformer fusion approach to effectively capture and synchronize interlinked features from both audio and video inputs, thereby resolving synchronization problems. Additionally, the Cross Attention mechanism within AVT-CA selectively extracts and emphasizes critical features while discarding irrelevant ones from both modalities, addressing feature extraction and fusion challenges. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. The results underscore the importance of AVT-CA in developing precise and reliable multimodal emotion recognition systems for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Joint Fine-tuning and Conversion of Pretrained Speech and Language Models towards Linear Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Assisted AI Model for Real-Time Underwater Sound Speed Estimation Leveraging Remote Sensing Sea Surface Temperature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.</description>
