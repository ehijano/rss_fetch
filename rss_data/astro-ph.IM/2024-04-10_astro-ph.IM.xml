      <title>REPUBLIC: A variability-preserving systematic-correction algorithm for PLATO's multi-camera light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based photometry missions produce exquisite light curves that contain a wealth of stellar variability on a wide range of timescales. Light curves also typically contain significant instrumental systematics -- spurious, non-astrophysical trends that are common, in varying degrees, to many light curves. Empirical systematics-correction approaches using the information in the light curves themselves have been very successful, but tend to suppress astrophysical signals, particularly on longer timescales. Unlike its predecessors, the PLATO mission will use multiple cameras to monitor the same stars. We present REPUBLIC, a novel systematics-correction algorithm which exploits this multi-camera configuration to correct systematics that differ between cameras, while preserving the component of each star's signal that is common to all cameras, regardless of timescale. Through simulations with astrophysical signals (star spots and planetary transits), Kepler-like errors, and white noise, we demonstrate REPUBLIC's ability to preserve long-term astrophysical signals usually lost in standard correction techniques. We also explore REPUBLIC's performance with different number of cameras and systematic properties. We conclude that REPUBLIC should be considered a potential complement to existing strategies for systematic correction in multi-camera surveys, with its utility contingent upon further validation and adaptation to the specific characteristics of the PLATO mission data</description>

      <title>The Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time DP0.2 processing campaign at CC-IN2P3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, currently in construction in Chile, will start performing the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) in 2025 for 10 years. Its 8.4-meter telescope will survey the southern sky in less than 4 nights in six optical bands, and repeatedly generate about 2 000 exposures per night, corresponding to a data volume of about 20 TiB every night. Three data facilities are preparing to contribute to the production of the annual data releases: the US Data Facility will process 35% of the raw data, the UK data facility will process 25% of the raw data and the French data facility, operated by CC-IN2P3, will locally process the remaining 40% of the raw data. In the context of the Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2), the Data Release Production pipelines have been executed on the DC-2 simulated dataset (generated by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration, DESC). This dataset includes 20 000 simulated exposures, representing 300 square degrees of Rubin images with a typical depth of 5 years. DP0.2 ran at the Interim Data Facility (based on Google cloud), and the full exercise was independently replicated at CC-IN2P3. During this exercise, 3 PiB of data and more than 200 million files were produced. In this contribution we will present a detailed description of the system that we set up to perform this processing campaign using CC-IN2P3's computing and storage infrastructure. Several topics will be addressed: workflow generation and execution, batch job submission, memory and I/O requirements, etc. We will focus on the issues that arose during this campaign and how we addressed them and will present some perspectives after this exercise.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Atmospheric Dispersion Correction of the Gemini Planet Imager: residual dispersion above design requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC) of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) corrects the chromatic dispersion caused by differential atmospheric refraction (DAR), making it an important optic for exoplanet observation. Despite requiring less than 5 mas of residual DAR to avoid potentially affecting the coronagraph, the GPI ADC averages $\sim7$ and $\sim11$ mas of residual DAR in $H$ and $J$ band respectively. We analyzed GPI data in those bands to find explanations for the underperformance. We found the model GPI uses to predict DAR underestimates humidity's impact on incident DAR, causing on average a 0.54 mas increase in $H$ band residual DAR. Additionally, the GPI ADC consistently undercorrects in $H$ band by about 7 mas, causing almost all the $H$ band residual DAR. $J$ band does not have such an offset. Perpendicular dispersion induced by the GPI ADC, potentially from a misalignment in the prisms' relative orientation, causes 86% of the residual DAR in $J$ band. Correcting these issues could reduce residual DAR, thereby improving exoplanet detection. We also made a new approximation for the index of refraction of air from 0.7 microns to 1.36 microns that more accurately accounts for the effects of humidity.</description>

Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136: Microlensing events with prominent orbital effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a project to reexamine microlensing data gathered from high-cadence surveys. The aim of the project is to reinvestigate lensing events with light curves exhibiting intricate anomaly features associated with caustics, yet lacking prior proposed models to explain these features. Through detailed reanalyses considering higher-order effects, we identify that accounting for orbital motions of lenses is vital in accurately explaining the anomaly features observed in the light curves of the lensing events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136. We estimate the masses and distances to the lenses by conducting Bayesian analyses using the lensing parameters of the newly found lensing solutions. From these analyses, we identify that the lenses of the events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971 and MOA-2023-BLG-065 are binaries composed of M dwarfs, while the lens of OGLE-2023-BLG-0136 is likely to be a binary composed of an early K-dwarf primary and a late M-dwarf companion. For all lensing events, the probability of the lens residing in the bulge is considerably higher than that of it being located in the disk.</description>

      <title>Resolution enhancement of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the solar magnetic field and its effects on solar dynamo mechanisms and space weather events has benefited from the continual improvements in instrument resolution and measurement frequency. The augmentation and assimilation of historical observational data timelines also play a significant role in understanding the patterns of solar magnetic field variation. Within the realm of astronomical data processing, superresolution reconstruction refers to the process of using a substantial corpus of training data to learn the nonlinear mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images,thereby achieving higher-resolution astronomical images. This paper is an application study in highdimensional non-linear regression. Deep learning models were employed to perform SR modeling on SOHO/MDI magnetograms and SDO/HMI magnetograms, thus reliably achieving resolution enhancement of full-disk SOHO/MDI magnetograms and enhancing the image resolution to obtain more detailed information. For this study, a dataset comprising 9717 pairs of data from April 2010 to February 2011 was used as the training set,1332 pairs from March 2011 were used as the validation set, and 1,034 pairs from April 2011 were used as the test set. After data preprocessing, we randomly cropped 128x128 sub-images as the LR from the full-disk MDI magnetograms, and the corresponding 512x512 sub-images as HR from the HMI full-disk magnetograms for model training. The tests conducted have shown that the study successfully produced reliable 4x super-resolution reconstruction of full-disk MDI magnetograms.The MESR model'sresults (0.911) were highly correlated with the target HMI magnetographs as indicated by the correlation coefficient values. Furthermore, the method achieved the best PSNR, SSIM, MAE and RMSE values, indicating that the MESR model can effectively reconstruct magnetog.</description>

      <title>Detection of Contact Binary Candidates Observed By TESS Using Autoencoder Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact binary may be the progenitor of a red nova that eventually produces a merger event and have a cut-off period around 0.2 days. Therefore, a large number of contact binaries is needed to search for the progenitor of red novae and to study the characteristics of short-period contact binaries. In this paper, we employ the Phoebe program to generate a large number of light curves based on the fundamental parameters of contact binaries. Using these light curves as samples, an autoencoder model is trained, which can reconstruct the light curves of contact binaries very well. When the error between the output light curve from the model and the input light curve is large, it may be due to other types of variable stars. The goodness of fit (R2) between the output light curve from the model and the input light curve is calculated. Based on the thresholds for global goodness of fit (R2), period, range magnitude, and local goodness of fit (R2), a total of 1322 target candidates were obtained.</description>

      <title>ClassiPyGRB: Machine Learning-Based Classification and Visualization of Gamma Ray Bursts using t-SNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRBs) are the brightest events in the universe. For decades, astrophysicists have known about their cosmological nature. Every year, space missions such as Fermi and SWIFT detect hundreds of them. In spite of this large sample, GRBs show a complex taxonomy in the first seconds after their appearance, which makes it very difficult to find similarities between them using conventional techniques. It is known that GRBs originate from the death of a massive star or from the merger of two compact objects. GRB classification is typically based on the duration of the burst (Kouveliotou et al., 1993). Nevertheless, events such as GRB 211211A (Yang et al., 2022), whose duration of about 50 seconds lies in the group of long GRBs, has challenged this categorization by the evidence of features related with the short GRB population (the kilonova emission and the properties of its host galaxy). Therefore, a classification based only on their gamma-ray duration does not provide a completely reliable determination of the progenitor. Motivated by this problem, Jespersen et al. (2020) and Steinhardt et al. (2023) carried out analysis of GRB light curves by using the t-SNE algorithm, showing that Swift/BAT GRBs database, consisting of light curves in four energy bands (15-25 keV, 25-50 keV, 50-100 keV, 100-350 keV), clusters into two groups corresponding with the typical long/short classification. However, in this case, this classification is based on the information provided by their gamma-ray emission light curves. ClassiPyGRB is a Python 3 package to download, process, visualize and classify GRBs database from the Swift/BAT Instrument (up to July 2022). It is distributed over the GNU General Public License Version 2 (1991). We also included a noise-reduction and an interpolation tools for achieving a deeper analysis of the data.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the in-orbit center-of-mass of TaiJi-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taiji program is a space mission aiming to detect gravitational waves in the low frequency band. Taiji-1 is the first technology demonstration satellite of the Taiji Program in Space, with the gravitational reference sensor (GRS) serving as one of its key scientific payloads. For accurate accelerometer measurements, the test-mass center of the GRS must be positioned precisely at the center of gravity of the satellite to avoid measurement disturbances caused by angular acceleration and gradient. Due to installation and measurement errors, fuel consumption during in-flight phase, and other factors, the offset between the test-mass center and the center-of-mass (COM) of the satellite can be significant, degrading the measurement accuracy of the accelerometer. Therefore, the offset needs to be estimated and controlled within the required range by the center-of-mass adjustment mechanism during the satellite's lifetime. In this paper, we present a novel method, the Extended Kalman Filter combined with Rauch-Tung-Striebel Smoother, to estimate the offset, while utilizing the chi-square test to eliminate outliers. Additionally, the nonlinear Least Squares estimation algorithm is employed as a crosscheck to estimate the offset of COM. The two methods are shown to give consistent results, with the offset estimated to be $dx \approx $$-$$0.19$ mm, $dy \approx 0.64$ mm, and $dz \approx $$-$$0.82$ mm. The results indicate a significant improvement on the noise level of GRS after the COM calibration, which will be of great help for the future Taiji program.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk effects in microwave SQUID multiplexed TES bolometer readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers are broadly used for background-limited astrophysical measurements from the far-infrared to mm-waves. Many planned future instruments require increasingly large detector arrays, but their scalability is limited by their cryogenic readout electronics. Microwave SQUID multiplexing offers a highly capable scaling solution through the use of inherently broadband circuitry, enabling readout of hundreds to thousands of channels per microwave line. As with any multiplexing technique, the channelization mechanism gives rise to electrical crosstalk which must be understood and controlled so as to not degrade the instrument sensitivity. Here, we explore implications relevant for TES bolometer array applications, focusing in particular on upcoming mm-wave observatories such as the Simons Observatory and AliCPT. We model the relative contributions of the various underlying crosstalk mechanisms, evaluate the difference between fixed-tone and tone-tracking readout systems, and discuss ways in which crosstalk nonlinearity will complicate on-sky measurements.</description>

      <title>Beyond radial profiles: Using log-normal distributions to model the multiphase circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations and simulations reveal that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies is multiphase, with the gas temperatures spanning a wide range at most radii, $\sim 10^4\ {\rm K}$ to the virial temperature ($\sim 10^6$ K for Milky Way). Traditional CGM models using simple density profiles are inadequate at reproducing observations that indicate a broad temperature range. Alternatively, a model based on probability distribution functions (PDFs) with parameters motivated by simulations can better match multi-wavelength observations. In this work, we use log-normal distributions, commonly seen in the simulations of the multiphase interstellar and circumgalactic media, to model the multiphase CGM. We generalize the isothermal background model by Faerman et al. 2017 to include more general CGM profiles. We extend the existing probabilistic models from 1D-PDFs in temperature to 2D-PDFs in density-temperature phase space and constrain its parameters using a Milky Way-like {\tt Illustris TNG50-1} halo. We generate various synthetic observables such as column densities of different ions, UV/X-ray spectra, and dispersion and emission measures. X-ray and radio (Fast Radio Burst) observations mainly constrain the hot gas properties. However, interpreting cold/warm phase diagnostics is not straightforward since these phases are patchy, with inherent variability in intercepting these clouds along arbitrary lines of sight. We provide a tabulated comparison of model predictions with observations and plan to expand this into a comprehensive compilation of models and data. Our modeling provides a simple analytic framework that is useful for describing important aspects of the multiphase CGM.</description>

      <title>Comparing transit spectroscopy pipelines at the catalogue level: evidence for systematic differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of inconsistent results from different data pipelines, even when starting from identical data, is a recognized concern in exoplanetary science. As we transition into the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era and prepare for the ARIEL space mission, addressing this issue becomes paramount because of its implications on our understanding of exoplanets. Although comparing pipeline results for individual exoplanets has become more common, this study is the first to compare pipeline results at the catalogue level. We present a comprehensive framework to statistically compare the outcomes of data analysis reduction on a population of exoplanets and we leverage the large number of observations conducted using the same instrument configured with HST-WFC3. We employ three independent pipelines: Iraclis, EXCALIBUR, and CASCADe. Our combined findings reveal that these pipelines, despite starting from the same data and planet system parameters, yield substantially different spectra in some cases. However, the most significant manifestations of pipeline differences are observed in the compositional trends of the resulting exoplanet catalogues. We conclude that pipeline-induced differences lead to biases in the retrieved information, which are not reflected in the retrieved uncertainties. Our findings underscore the critical need to confront these pipeline differences to ensure the reproducibility, accuracy, and reliability of results in exoplanetary research. Our results demonstrate the need to understand the potential for population-level bias that pipelines may inject, which could compromise our understanding of exoplanets as a class of objects.</description>

Abstract: A primary scientific goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory will be the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets. Estimates of the exoplanet yields for this concept will help guide mission design through detailed trade studies. It is therefore critical that yield estimation codes optimally adapt observations to the mission's performance parameters to ensure accurate trade studies. To aid in this, we implement wavelength optimization in yield calculations for the first time, allowing the yield code to determine the ideal detection and characterization bandpasses. We use this new capability to confirm the observational wavelength assumptions made for the LUVOIR-B study, namely that the optimum detection wavelength is 500 nm for the majority of targets and the optimum wavelength to detect water is near 1000 nm, given LUVOIR-B's assumed instrument performance parameters. We show that including the wavelength dependent albedo of an Earth twin as a prior provides no significant benefit to the yields of exoEarth candidates and caution against tuning observations to modern Earth twins. We also show that coronagraphs whose inner working angles are similar to step functions may benefit from wavelength optimization and demonstrate how wavelength-dependent instrument performance can impact the optimum wavelengths for detection and characterization. The optimization methods we implement automate wavelength selection and remove uncertainties regarding these choices, helping to adapt the observations to the instrument's performance parameters.</description>
