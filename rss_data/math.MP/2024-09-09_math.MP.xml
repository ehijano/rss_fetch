      <title>Spin-charge separation for paired Dirac fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions at finite density coupled to a complex pairing field assumed to obey scalar field theory with quartic self-repulsion. The bulk of our work develops the mathematics that elucidates the propagation of fermionic excitations in such systems as independent spin (boosts) and charge (fermion number) degrees of freedom. A necessary ingredient is the presence of broken $U(1)$ symmetry in the pairing field and decoupling of its density and phase. In the fermion sector, these elements give rise to an emergent spin-dependent gauge coupling which binds in-vacuum spin and charge into elementary fermions, while driving proliferation of unbound spin and charge for finite condensation in the pairing field. Notably, the onset of spin-charge separation is signaled by $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetry breaking and decoupling of spin components under Lorentz transformations. Our investigation concludes with two theorems that identify generic features of spin-charge separation in such systems.</description>

      <title>Dual conformal invariant kinematics and folding of Grassmannian cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory study, Grassmannian manifolds $\text{Gr}(4,n)$ are closely related to $D{=}4$ kinematics input for $n$-particle scattering processes, whose combinatorial and geometrical structures have been widely applied in studying conformal invariant physical theories and their scattering amplitudes. Recently, \cite{HLY21} observed that constraining $D{=}4$ kinematics input to its $D{=}3$ subspace can be interpreted as folding Grassmannian cluster algebras $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(4,n)]$. In this paper, we deduce general expressions for these constraints in terms of Pl\"ucker variables of $\text{Gr}(4,n)$ directly from $D{=}3$ subspace definition, and propose a series of initial quivers for algebra $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(4,n)]$ whose folding conditions exactly meet the constraints, which proves the observation finally.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Length Limit of Spectral Curves and Inverse Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrability equips models of theoretical physics with efficient methods for the exact construction of useful states and their evolution. Relevant tools for classical integrable field models in one spatial dimensional are spectral curves in the case of periodic fields and inverse scattering for asymptotic boundary conditions. Even though the two methods are quite different in many ways, they ought to be related by taking the periodicity length of closed boundary conditions to infinity.
  Using the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the continuous Heisenberg magnet as prototypical classical integrable field models, we discuss and illustrate how data for spectral curves transforms into asymptotic scattering data. In order to gain intuition and also for concreteness, we review how the elliptic states of these models degenerate into solitons at infinite length.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Equation Near Centenary: a Contemporary Introduction to the Dirac Equation Consideration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More then 35 approaches to the Dirac equation derivation are presented. The various physical principles and mathematical methods are used. A review of well-known and not enough known contributions to the problem is given, the unexpected and unconventional derivations are presented as well. Three original approaches to the problem suggested by the author are considered as well. They are (i) the generalization of H. Sallhofer derivation, (ii) the obtaining of the massless Dirac equation from the Maxwell equations in maximally symmetrical form, (iii) the derivation of the Dirac equation with nonzero mass from the relativistic canonical quantum mechanics of the fermion-antifermion spin s=1/2 doublet. Today we are able to demonstrate new features of our derivations given in original papers. In some sense the important role of the Dirac equation in contemporary theoretical physics is demonstrated. A criterion for the usefulness of one or another derivation of the Dirac equation has been established</description>

      <title>The emptiness formation probability, and representations for nonlocal correlation functions, of the 20-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emptiness formation probability, along with various representations for nonlocal correlation functions, of the 20-vertex model. In doing so, we leverage previous arguments for representations of nonlocal correlation functions for the 6-vertex model, under domain-wall boundary conditions, due to Colomo, Di Giulio, and Pronko, in addition to the inhomogeneous, and homogeneous, determinantal representations for the 20-vertex partition function due to Di Francesco, also under domain-wall boundary conditions. By taking a product of row configuration probabilities, we obtain a desired contour integral representation for nonlocal correlations from a determinantal representation. Finally, a counterpart of the emptiness formation probability is introduced for the 20-vertex model.</description>

      <title>Exact Bethe quantum numbers of the massive XXZ chain in the two down-spin sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every solution of the Bethe ansatz equations (BAE) is characterized by a set of quantum numbers called the Bethe quantum numbers, which are fundamental for evaluating it numerically. We rigorously derive the Bethe quantum numbers for the real solutions of the spin-1/2 massive XXZ spin chain in the two down-spin sector, assuming the existence of solutions to some form of BAE. In the sector the quantum numbers $J_1$ and $J_2$ were derived for complex solutions, but not for real solutions. We show the exact results in the sector as follows. (\si) When two Bethe quantum numbers are different, i.e., for $J_1 \ne J_2$, we introduce a graphical method, which we call a contour method, for deriving the solution of BAE to a given set of Bethe quantum numbers. By the method, we can readily show the existence and the uniqueness of the solution. (\sii) When two Bethe quantum numbers are equal, i.e. for $J_1 = J_2$, we derive the criteria for the collapse of two-strings and the emergence of an extra two-string by an analytic method. (\siii) We obtain the number of real solutions, which depends on the site number $N$ and the XXZ anisotropy parameter $\zeta$. (\siv) We derive all infinite-valued solutions of BAE for the XXX spin chain in the two down-spin sector through the XXX limit. (\sv) We explicitly show the completeness of the Bethe ansatz in terms of the Bethe quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions of the six-vertex IRF model and its quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the interaction-round-a-face version of the isotropic six-vertex model. The associated spin chain is made of two coupled Heisenberg spin chains with different boundary twists. The phase diagram of the model and the long distance correlations were studied in [Nucl. Phys. B, 995 (2023) 116333]. Here, we compute the short-distance correlation functions of the model in the ground state for finite system sizes via non-linear integral equations and in the thermodynamic limit. This was possible since the model satisfies the face version of the discrete quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equation. A suitable ansatz for the density matrix is proposed in the form of a direct sum of two Heisenberg density matrices, which allows us to obtain the discrete functional equation for the two-site function $\omega(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$. Thanks to the known results on the factorization of correlation functions of the Heisenberg chain, we are able to compute the density matrix of the IRF model for up to four sites and its associated spin chain for up to three sites.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the Kac stochastic particle system converges to the weak solution of the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for hard potentials and hard spheres. We give, under the initial data with finite exponential moment assumption, an explicit rate of propagation of chaos in squared Wasserstein distance with quadratic cost by using a double coupling technique.</description>

      <title>Shift operators and momentum-space conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A momentum-space approach to conformal field theory offers a new perspective on cosmological correlators and better reveals the underlying connections to scattering amplitudes. This thesis explores the interplay between integral representations and shift operators.
  A representation for the general $n$-point function of scalar operators was recently proposed in the form of a Feynman integral with the topology of an $(n-1)$-simplex, featuring an arbitrary function of momentum-space cross ratios. We show the graph polynomials for this integral can all be expressed in terms of the first and second minors of the Laplacian matrix for the simplex. Computing the effective resistance between nodes of the corresponding electrical network, an inverse parametrisation is found in terms of the determinant and first minors of the Cayley-Menger matrix. These parametrisations reveal new families of shift operators expressible as determinants that connect $n$-point functions in spacetime dimensions differing by two. Furthermore, they enable the validity of the conformal Ward identities to be established directly without recourse to recursion in the number of points.
  We then analyse the representation of conformal and Feynman integrals through a class of multivariable hypergeometric functions proposed by Gelfand, Kapranov \&amp; Zelevinsky. Among other advantages, this formalism enables the systematic construction of highly non-trivial weight-shifting operators known as ``creation'' operators. We discuss these operators emphasising their close connection to the spectral singularities that arise for special parameter values, and their relationship to the Newton polytope of the integrand. Via these methods we construct novel weight-shifting operators connecting contact Witten diagrams of different operator and spacetime dimensions, as well as exchange diagrams with purely non-derivative vertices.</description>

      <title>Statistics for Differential Topological Properties between Data Sets with an Application to Reservoir Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common for researchers to record long, multiple time series from experiments or calculations. But sometimes there are no good models for the systems or no applicable mathematical theorems that can tell us when there are basic relationships between subsets of the time series data such as continuity, differentiability, embeddings, etc. The data is often higher dimensional and simple plotting will not guide us. At that point fitting the data to polynomials, Fourier series, etc. becomes uncertain. Even at the simplest level, having data that shows there is a function between the data subsets is useful and a negative answer means that more particular data fitting or analysis will be suspect and probably fail. We show here statistics that test time series subsets for basic mathematical properties and relations between them that not only indicate when more specific analyses are safe to do, but whether the systems are operating correctly. We apply these statistics to examples from reservoir computing where an important property of reservoir computers is that the reservoir system establishes an embedding of the drive system in order to make any other calculations with the reservoir computer successful.</description>

      <title>On a Solution to the Dirac Equation with a Triangular Potential Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral anomalies resulting from the breaking of classical symmetries at the quantum level are fundamental to quantum field theory and gaining ever-growing importance in the description of topological materials in condensed matter physics. Here we present analytical solutions of the Dirac equation for massless 3+1 fermions confined to an infinite stripe and placed into a background gauge field forming a triangular potential well across the width of the stripe. Such an effective 1+1 system hosts zero-energy modes resulting in the gauge field-dependent chiral anomaly structure. This problem has a direct relation to a half-bearded graphene nanoribbon placed into an in-plane external electric field and offers it an exact solution in terms of new special functions that are similar but not reducible to Airy functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the non-degeneracy of bubbling solutions for singular mean field equations when the blow-up points are either regular or non-quantized singular sources. This extends the results from Bartolucci-Jevnikar-Lee-Yang \cite{bart-5}, which focused on regular blow-up points. As a result, we establish the strict convexity of the entropy in the large energy limit for a specific class of two-dimensional domains in the Onsager mean field vortex model with sinks.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive exploration of quasisymmetric stellarators and their coil sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We augment the `QUAsi-symmetric Stellarator Repository' (QUASR) to include vacuum field stellarators with quasihelical symmetry using a globalized optimization workflow. The database now has almost 370,000 quasisaxisymmetry and quasihelically symmetric devices along with coil sets, optimized for a variety of aspect ratios, rotational transforms, and discrete rotational symmetries. This paper outlines a couple of ways to explore and characterize the data set. We plot devices on a near-axis quasisymmetry landscape, revealing close correspondence to this predicted landscape. We also use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data so that it can easily be visualized in two or three dimensions. Principal component analysis also gives a mechanism to compare the new devices here to previously published ones in the literature. We are able to characterize the structure of the data, observe clusters, and visualize the progression of devices in these clusters. These techniques reveal that the data has structure, and that typically one, two or three principal components are sufficient to characterize it. QUASR is archived at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10050655 and can be explored online at quasr.flatironinstitute.org.</description>

      <title>Correlation between residual entropy and spanning tree entropy of ice-type models on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The logarithm of the number of Eulerian orientations, scaled by the number of vertices, is known as the residual entropy in studies of ice-type models on graphs. The spanning tree entropy depends similarly on the number of spanning trees. We demonstrate and investigate a remarkably strong, though non-deterministic, correlation between these two entropies. This leads us to propose a new heuristic estimate for the residual entropy of regular graphs that performs much better than previous heuristics. We also study the expansion properties and residual entropy of random graphs with given degrees.</description>

      <title>Optimal solutions employing an algebraic Variational Multiscale approach Part I: Steady Linear Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends our previous study from S. Shrestha et al. (2024) by introducing a new abstract framework for Variational Multiscale (VMS) methods at the discrete level. We introduce the concept of what we define as the optimal projector and present an approach where the infinite-dimensional unresolved scales are approximated in a finite-dimensional subspace using the numerically computed Fine-Scale Greens' function of the underlying symmetric problem. The proposed approach involves solving the VMS problem on two separate meshes: a coarse mesh for the full PDE and a fine mesh for the symmetric part of the continuous differential operator. We consider the 1D and 2D steady advection-diffusion problems in both direct and mixed formulations as the test cases in this paper. Moreover, we demonstrate the working of this method using the Mimetic Spectral Element Method (MSEM), however, it may be applied to other Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric frameworks. Furthermore, we propose that VMS should not be viewed as a stabilisation technique; instead, the base scheme should be inherently stable, with VMS enhancing the solution quality by supplementing the base scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Weyl laws for Schr\"odinger operators with critically singular potentials on compact manifolds with boundary. We also improve the Weyl remainder estimates under the condition that the set of all periodic geodesic billiards has measure 0. These extend the classical results by Seeley, Ivrii and Melrose. The proof uses the Gaussian heat kernel bounds for short times and a perturbation argument involving the wave equation.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of global solutions for a class of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider global solutions of a class of non-linear wave equations of the form \begin{equation*}
  \Box u= N(x,t,u)u, \end{equation*} where the nonlinearity~$ N(x,t,u)u$ is assumed to satisfy appropriate boundedness assumptions.
  Under these appropriate assumptions we prove that the free channel wave operator exists. Moreover, if the interaction term~$N(x,t,u)u$ is localised, then we prove that the global solution of the full nonlinear equation can be decomposed into a `free' part and a `localised' part.
  The present work can be seen as an extension of the scattering results of~\cite{SW20221} for the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Singularity formed by the collision of two collapsing solitons in interaction for the 2D Keller-Segel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the two-dimensional Keller-Segel system admits finite time blowup solutions, which is the case if the initial density has a total mass greater than $8\pi$ and a finite second moment. Several constructive examples of such solutions have been obtained, where for all of them a perturbed stationary state undergoes scale instability and collapses at a point, resulting in a $8\pi$-mass concentration. It was conjectured that singular solutions concentrating simultaneously more than one solitons could exist. We construct rigorously such a new blowup mechanism, where two stationary states are simultaneously collapsing and colliding, resulting in a $16\pi$-mass concentration at a single blowup point, and with a new blowup rate which corresponds to the formal prediction by Seki, Sugiyama and Vel\'azquez. We develop for the first time a robust framework to construct rigorously such blowup solutions involving simultaneously the non-radial collision and concentration of several solitons, which we expect to find applications to other evolution problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the completeness relation for the eigenvectors, which is an essential assumption of quantum mechanics, remains true if the initial Hamiltonian, having a discrete spectrum, is modified by a delta potential (to be made precise by a renormalization scheme) supported at a point in two and three-dimensional compact manifolds or Euclidean spaces. The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space.</description>

      <title>Hietarinta's classification of $4\times 4$ constant Yang-Baxter operators using algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying Yang-Baxter operators is an essential first step in the study of the simulation of integrable quantum systems on quantum computers. One of the earliest initiatives was taken by Hietarinta in classifying constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). He obtained 11 families of invertible solutions, including the one generated by the permutation operator. While these methods work well for 4 by 4 solutions, they become cumbersome for higher dimensional representations. In this work, we overcome this restriction by constructing the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent manner by using ans\"{a}tze from algebraic structures. We use four different algebraic structures that reproduce 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families when the qubit representation is chosen. The methods include a set of commuting operators, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and partition algebras. We do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class with these methods.</description>

      <title>Casimir preserving numerical method for global multilayer geostrophic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate long-term predictions of large-scale flow features on planets are crucial for understanding global atmospheric and oceanic systems, necessitating the development of numerical methods that can preserve essential physical structures over extended simulation periods without excessive computational costs. Recent advancements in the study of global single-layer barotropic models have led to novel numerical methods based on Lie-Poisson discretization that preserve energy, enstrophy and higher-order moments of potential vorticity. This work extends this approach to more complex stratified quasi-geostrophic (QG) systems on the sphere.
  In this work, we present a formulation of the multi-layer QG equations on the full globe. This allows for extending the Lie-Poisson discretization to multi-layer QG models, ensuring consistency with the underlying structure and enabling long-term simulations without additional regularization. The numerical method is benchmarked through simulations of forced geostrophic turbulence and the long-term behaviour of unforced multi-layered systems. These results demonstrate the structure-preserving properties and robustness of the proposed numerical method, paving the way for a better understanding of the role of high-order conserved quantities in large-scale geophysical flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Abel-Plana formula as a renormalization tool in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory the vacuum expectation values of physical observables, bilinear in the field operator, diverge. Among the most important points in the investigations of those expectation values is the regularization of divergent expressions, separation of divergences and the renormalization. In problems with boundaries the expectation values are expressed in the form of the difference of the divergent series and the corresponding integral. In problems with planar boundaries a finite integral representation for that difference is provided by the Abel-Plana summation formula. In the present contribution we consider the generalization of the Abel-Plana formula that allows to obtain similar representations for more general classes of series where the summation goes over the zeros of a given function. Applications are discussed in quantum field theoretical problems with nontrivial spatial topology and curved boundaries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we complete the program initiated in \cite{ternary} and rigorously derive a Boltzmann-type equation that incorporates higher order collisions among gas particles. More precisely, starting from a finite $N$-particle system where the particles can perform symmetric hard sphere type interactions up to arbitrarily high order $M$, we derive a kinetic equation which consists of a linear combination of higher order collisional terms. We identify the new scaling regime that facilitates such collisions and systematically generalize geometric techniques allowing us to analyze the correlation of potentially distinct order recollisions as time evolves.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the auxiliary field deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) introduced in arXiv:2405.05899 and arXiv:2407.16338 to sigma models whose target manifolds are symmetric or semi-symmetric spaces, including a Wess-Zumino term in the latter case. This gives rise to a new infinite family of classically integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ coset models of the form which are of interest in applications of integrability to worldsheet string theory and holography. We demonstrate that every theory in this infinite class admits a zero-curvature representation for its equations of motion by exhibiting a Lax connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of symplectic reduction in the infinite-dimensional setting, covering both the regular and singular case. Extending the classical work of Marsden, Weinstein, Sjamaar and Lerman, we address challenges unique to infinite dimensions, such as the failure of the Darboux theorem and the absence of the Marle-Guillemin-Sternberg normal form. Our novel approach centers on a normal form of only the momentum map, for which we utilize new local normal form theorems for smooth equivariant maps in the infinite-dimensional setting. This normal form is then used to formulate the theory of singular symplectic reduction in infinite dimensions. We apply our results to important examples like the Yang-Mills equation and the Teichm\"uller space over a Riemann surface.</description>

Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for realizing anyon condensation of topological orders within the string-net model by constructing a Hamiltonian that bridges the parent string-net model before and the child string-net model after anyon condensation. Our approach classifies all possible types of bosonic anyon condensation in any parent string-net model and identifies the basic degrees of freedom in the corresponding child models. Compared with the traditional UMTC perspective of topological orders, our method offers a finer categorical description of anyon condensation at the microscopic level. We also explicitly represent relevant UMTC categorical entities characterizing anyon condensation through our model-based physical quantities, providing practical algorithms for calculating these categorical data.</description>

      <title>Preserving the Hermiticity of the One-Body Density Matrix for a Non-Interacting Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-body density matrix (ODM) for a zero temperature non-interacting Fermi gas can be approximately obtained in the semiclassical regime through different $\hbar$-expansion techniques. One would expect that each method of approximating the ODM should yield equivalent density matrices which are both Hermitian and idempotent to any order in $\hbar$. However, the Kirzhnits and Wigner-Kirkwood methods do not yield these properties, while the Grammaticos-Voros method does. Here we show explicitly, for arbitrary $d$-dimensions through an appropriate change into symmetric coordinates, that each method is indeed identical, Hermitian, and idempotent. This change of variables resolves the inconsistencies between the various methods, showing that the non-Hermitian and non-idempotent behavior of the Kirzhnits and Wigner-Kirkwood methods is an artifact of performing a non-symmetric truncation to the semiclassical $\hbar$-expansions. Our work also provides the first explicit derivation of the $d$-dimensional Grammaticos-Voros ODM, originally proposed by Redjati et al (2019 $\textit{J. Phys. Chem. Solids}$ 134 313-8) based on their $d=1,2,3,4$ expressions.</description>

      <title>Integrable hierarchies and F-manifolds with compatible connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the interplay between geometry and integrability, we show that F-manifolds with compatible connection $(\nabla,\circ,e)$ are the geometric counterpart of integrable systems of quasilinear first order evolutionary PDEs. We consider F-manifolds equipped with an Euler vector field and assume that the operator $L=E\circ$ is regular. This generalises previous results in the semisimple context. As an example we study regular F-manifolds with compatible connection $(\nabla,\circ,e,E)$ associated with integrable hierarchies obtained from the solutions of the equation $d\cdot d_L \,a_0=0$ by applying the construction of [27]. We show that $n$-dimensional F-manifolds associated to operators $L$ with $r\le n$ Jordan blocks $L_\alpha$ of size $m_\alpha$ are classified by $n$ arbitrary functions of a single variable, where each block $L_\alpha$ contributes with $m_\alpha$ functions of the variable appearing in the diagonal of the block. In the case of a single Jordan block of arbitrary size we show that flat connections $\nabla$ correspond to linear solutions $a_0$. This generalises part of the construction of [31] where special linear solutions were considered. We illustrate the construction in dimensions $2,3,$ and $4$ for any choice of Jordan canonical form and any choice of the corresponding solution $a_0$. In these dimensions we have that linear solutions define bi-flat F-manifolds, and that the special linear solutions studied in [31] are related to Riemannian F-manifolds with Killing unit vector field. We conjecture that this is true in general.</description>

      <title>An integrable pseudospherical equation with pseudo-peakon solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an integrable equation whose solutions define a triad of one-forms describing a surface with Gaussian curvature -1. We identify a local group of diffeomorphisms that preserve these solutions and establish conserved quantities. From the symmetries, we obtain invariant solutions that provide explicit metrics for the surfaces. These solutions are unbounded and often appear in mirrored pairs. We introduce the ``collage'' method, which uses conserved quantities to remove unbounded parts and smoothly join the solutions, leading to weak solutions consistent with the conserved quantities. As a result we get pseudo-peakons, which are smoother than Camassa-Holm peakons. Additionally, we apply a Miura-type transformation to relate our equation to the Degasperis-Procesi equation, allowing us to recover peakon and shock-peakon solutions for it from the solutions of the other equation.</description>

      <title>Demkov-Fradkin tensor for curved harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the Demkov-Fradkin tensor of symmetries for the quantum curved harmonic oscillator in a space with constant curvature given by a parameter $\kappa$. In order to construct this tensor we have firstly found a set of basic operators which satisfy the following conditions: i) their products give symmetries of the problem; in fact the Hamiltonian is a combination of such products; ii) they generate the space of eigenfunctions as well as the eigenvalues in an algebraic way; iii) in the limit of zero curvature, they come into the well known creation/annihilation operators of the flat oscillator. The appropriate products of such basic operators will produce the curved Demkov-Fradkin tensor. However, these basic operators do not satisfy Heisenberg commutators but close another Lie algebra. As a by-product, the classical Demkov-Fradkin tensor for the classical curved harmonic oscillator has been obtained by the same method. The case of two dimensions has been worked out in detail: the operators close a $so_\kappa(4)$ Lie algebra; the spectrum and eigenfunctions are explicitly solved in an algebraic way and in the classical case the trajectories have been computed.</description>

      <title>Burgers turbulence in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove analytically and show numerically that the dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain is characterised by a transient Burgers turbulence regime on a wide range of time and energy scales. This regime is present at long wavelengths and energy per particle small enough that equipartition is not reached on a fast time scale. In this range, we prove that the driving mechanism to thermalisation is the formation of a shock that can be predicted using a pair of generalised Burgers equations. We perform a perturbative calculation at small energy per particle, proving that the energy spectrum of the chain $E_k$ decays as a power law, $E_k\sim k^{-\zeta(t)}$, on an extensive range of wavenumbers $k$. We predict that $\zeta(t)$ takes first the value $8/3$ at the Burgers shock time, and then reaches a value close to $2$ within two shock times. The value of the exponent $\zeta=2$ persists for several shock times before the system eventually relaxes to equipartition. During this wide time-window, an exponential cut-off in the spectrum is observed at large $k$, in agreement with previous results. Such a scenario turns out to be universal, i.e. independent of the parameters characterising the system and of the initial condition, once time is measured in units of the shock time.</description>

      <title>Edgeworth-type expansion for the one-point distribution of the KPZ fixed point with a large height at a prior location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04999v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fixed point $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ with the narrow-wedge initial condition and investigate the distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ conditioned on a large height at an earlier space-time point $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$. As $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ tends to infinity, we prove that the conditional one-point distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ in the regime $\tau&gt;\tau'$ converges to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) Tracy-Widom distribution and that the next two lower-order error terms can be expressed as derivatives of the Tracy-Widom distribution. The lowe order expansion here is analogue to the Edgeworth expansion in the central limit theorem. These KPZ-type limiting behaviors are different from the Gaussian-type ones obtained in \cite{Liu-Wang22} where they study the finite-dimensional distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ conditioned on a large height at a later space-time point $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$. They show, with the narrow-wedge initial condition, that the conditional random field $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ in the regime $\tau&lt;\tau'$ converges to the minimum of two independent Brownian bridges modified by linear drifts as $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ goes to infinity. The two results stated above provide the phase diagram of the asymptotic behaviors of a conditional law of KPZ fixed point in the regimes $\tau&gt;\tau'$ and $\tau&lt;\tau'$ when $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The instanton in the Sakai-Sugimoto model corresponds to the Skyrmion on the holographic boundary - which is asymptotically flat - and is fundamentally different from the flat Minkowski space Yang-Mills instanton. We use the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and a series of transformations to show that there are 6k zeromodes - or moduli - in the limit of infinite 't Hooft coupling of the Sakai-Sugimoto model. The implications for the low-energy baryons - the Skyrmions - on the holographic boundary, is a scale separation between 2k "heavy" massive modes and 6k-9 "light" massive modes for k&gt;1; the 9 global transformations that correspond to translations, rotations and isorotations remain as zeromodes. For k=1 there are 2 "heavy" modes and 6 zeromodes due to degeneracy between rotations and isorotations.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Quantum Particle Statistics: Bosons, Fermions, and Transtatistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identical quantum particles exhibit only two types of statistics: bosonic and fermionic. Theoretically, this restriction is commonly established through the symmetrization postulate or (anti)commutation constraints imposed on the algebra of creation and annihilation operators. The physical motivation for these axioms remains poorly understood, leading to various generalizations by modifying the mathematical formalism in somewhat arbitrary ways. In this work, we take an opposing route and classify quantum particle statistics based on operationally well-motivated assumptions. Specifically, we consider that a) the standard (complex) unitary dynamics defines the set of single-particle transformations, and b) phase transformations act locally in the space of multi-particle systems. We develop a complete characterization, which includes bosons and fermions as basic statistics with minimal symmetry. Interestingly, we have discovered whole families of novel statistics (dubbed transtatistics) accompanied by hidden symmetries, generic degeneracy of ground states, and spontaneous symmetry breaking -- effects that are (typically) absent in ordinary statistics.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of Wasserstein spaces over Euclidean spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of isometries of the quadratic Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$ over the sphere endowed with the distance inherited from the norm of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We prove that $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$ is isometrically rigid, meaning that its isometry group is isomorphic to that of $\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$. This is in striking contrast to the non-rigidity of its ambient space $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{R}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$ but in line with the rigidity of the geodesic space $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\sphericalangle\right)$. One of the key steps of the proof is the use of mean squared error functions to mimic displacement interpolation in $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$. A major difficulty in proving rigidity for quadratic Wasserstein spaces is that one cannot use the Wasserstein potential technique. To illustrate its general power, we use it to prove isometric rigidity of $\mathcal{W}_p\left(\mathbb{S}^1, \|\cdot\|\right)$ for $1 \leq p&lt;2.$</description>

      <title>On the superadditive pressure for 1-typical, one-step, matrix-cocycle potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma_T,\sigma)$ be a subshift of finite type with primitive adjacency matrix $T$, $\psi:\Sigma_T \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ a H\"older continuous potential, and $\mathcal{A}:\Sigma_T \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ a 1-typical, one-step cocycle. For $t \in \mathbb{R}$ consider the sequences of potentials $\Phi_t=(\varphi_{t,n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ defined by $$\varphi_{t,n}(x):=S_n \psi(x) + t\log \|\mathcal{A}^n(x)\|, \: \forall n \in \mathbb{N}.$$ Using the family of transfer operators defined in this setting by Park and Piraino, for all $t&lt;0$ sufficiently close to 0 we prove the existence of Gibbs-type measures for the superadditive sequences of potentials $\Phi_t$. This extends the results of the well-understood subadditive case where $t \geq 0$. Prior to this, Gibbs-type measures were only known to exist for $t&lt;0$ in the conformal, the reducible, the positive, or the dominated, planar settings, in which case they are Gibbs measures in the classical sense. We further prove that the topological pressure function $t \mapsto P_{\mathrm{top}}(\Phi_t,\sigma)$ is analytic in an open neighbourhood of 0 and has derivative given by the Lyapunov exponents of these Gibbs-type measures.</description>

Abstract: We consider operators acting in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $d\geq3$ that locally behave as a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. For the magnetic Schr\"odinger operators we suppose the magnetic potentials are smooth and the electric potential is five times differentiable and the fifth derivatives are H\"older continuous. Under these assumptions, we establish sharp spectral asymptotics for localised counting functions and Riesz means.</description>

Abstract: We consider semiclassical Schr\"odinger operators acting in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $d\geq3$. For these operators we establish a sharp spectral asymptotics without full regularity. For the counting function we assume the potential is locally integrable and that the negative part of the potential minus a constant is one time differentiable and the derivative is H\"older continues with parameter $\mu\geq1/2$. Moreover we also consider sharp Riesz means of order $\gamma$ with $\gamma\in(0,1]$. Here we assume the potential is locally integrable and that the negative part of the potential minus a constant is two time differentiable and the second derivative is H\"older continues with parameter $\mu$ that depends on $\gamma$.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct the analogue of the \v{d}Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal \v{d}Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain some apparently anomalous behaviour observed in numerically constructed solutions discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Erratum and Addendum to `Exact Maxwell evolution equation of resonator dynamics: temporal coupled-mode theory revisited'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent publication [Opt. Express \textbf{32}, 20904 (2024)], the accuracy of the main evolution equation that governs resonator dynamics in the coupled-mode theory (CMT) was questioned. Specifically, the study concluded that the driving force is proportional to the temporal derivative of the excitation field rather than the excitation field itself. This conclusion was reached with a derivation of an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation obtained directly from Maxwell's equations and was supported by comprehensive numerical tests. However, we find that the original derivation lacks mathematical rigor. In this work, we provide a direct and rigorous derivation. Besides offering a solid mathematical foundation for the EME equation, the new derivation elucidates the origin of the temporal derivative in the excitation term of CMT and clarifies the approximations in the classical CMT evolution equation using simple and general arguments.</description>

      <title>Integrable sigma model with generalized $\mathcal{F}$ structure, Yang-Baxter sigma model with generalized complex structure and multi-Yang-Baxter sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an integrable sigma model with a generalized $\mathcal{F}$ structure, which involves a generalized Nijenhuis structure $\mathcal{J}$ satisfying $\mathcal{J}^{3}=-\mathcal{J}$. Utilizing the expression of the generalized complex structure on the metric Lie group manifold $G$ in terms of operator relations on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we formulate a Yang-Baxter sigma model with a generalized complex structure. Additionally, we present multi-Yang-Baxter sigma models featuring two and three compatible Nijenhuis structures. Examples for each of these models are provided.</description>

      <title>Constraints and Time Evolution in Generic $f$(Riemann) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed canonical analysis of the $n$-dimensional $f$(Riemann) gravity, correcting the earlier results in the literature. We also write the field equations in the Fischer-Marsden form which is amenable to identifying the non-stationary energy on a spacelike hypersurface. We give pure $R^{2}$ and $R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ theories as examples.</description>

      <title>On stability of k-local quantum phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of $k$-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2&gt;0$ such that the size $\Gamma(r)$ of balls of radius $r$ on the interaction graph satisfy $\Gamma(r) = O(\exp(r^{1-\varepsilon_1}))$ and the local ground states of balls of radius $r\le\rho^\ast = O(\log(n)^{1+\varepsilon_2})$ are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the $D$-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires $\Gamma(r) = O(r^D)$ and $\rho^\ast = O(n^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have $\varepsilon_1 = 0$; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as $k$-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional inverse acoustic scattering problem by the BC-method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma:=[0,\infty)\times S^2$, $\mathscr F:=L_2(\Sigma)$. The {\it forward} acoustic scattering problem under consideration is to find $u=u^f(x,t)$ satisfying \begin{align} \label{Eq 01} &amp;u_{tt}-\Delta u+qu=0, &amp;&amp; (x,t) \in {\mathbb R}^3 \times (-\infty,\infty); \\ \label{Eq 02} &amp;u \mid_{|x|&lt;-t} =0 , &amp;&amp; t&lt;0;\\ \label{Eq 03} &amp;\lim_{s \to -\infty} s\,u((-s+\tau)\,\omega,s)=f(\tau,\omega), &amp;&amp; (\tau,\omega) \in \Sigma; \end{align} for a real valued compactly supported potential $q\in L_\infty(\Bbb R^3)$ and a control $f \in\mathscr F$. The response operator $R: \mathscr F\to\mathscr F$, \begin{align*} &amp; (Rf)(\tau ,\omega )\,:= \lim_{s \to +\infty} s\, u^f((s+\tau )\,\omega ,s), \quad (\tau ,\omega ) \in \Sigma \end{align*} depends on $q$ {\it locally}: if $\xi&gt;0$ and $f\in\mathscr F^\xi:=\{f\in\mathscr F\,|\,\,\,f\!\mid_{[0,\xi)}=0\}$ holds, then the values $(Rf)\!\mid_{\tau\geqslant\xi}$ are determined by $q\!\mid_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$ (do not depend on $q\!\mid_{|x|&lt;\xi}$).
  The {\it inverse problem} is: for an arbitrarily fixed $\xi&gt;0$, to determine $q\mid_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$ from $X^\xi R\upharpoonright\mathscr F^\xi$, where $X^\xi$ is the projection in $\mathscr F$ onto $\mathscr F^\xi$. It is solved by a relevant version of the boundary control method. The key point of the approach are recent results on the controllability of the system (\ref{Eq 01})--(\ref{Eq 03}).</description>

      <title>Hilbert schemes on blowing ups and the free Boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For different cohomology theories (including the Hochschild homology, Hodge cohomology, and Chow groups), we identify the cohomology of moduli space of rank 1 perverse coherent sheaves on the blow-up of a surface by Nakajima-Yoshioka as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes with a Fermionic Fock space. As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by geometric correspondences.</description>

      <title>On estimates of trace-norm distance between quantum Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

      <title>Braided Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate scalar electrodynamics in the braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and study its perturbative expansion in the algebraic framework of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We confirm that UV/IR mixing is absent at one-loop order in this noncommutative field theory, and that the non-anomalous Ward-Takahashi identities for the braided gauge symmetry are satisfied.</description>
