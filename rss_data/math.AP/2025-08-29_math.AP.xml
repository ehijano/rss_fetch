      <title>Equilibria of aggregation-diffusion models with nonlinear potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an evolution model with nonlinear diffusion of porous medium type in competition with a nonlocal drift term favoring mass aggregation. The distinguishing trait of the model is the choice of a nonlinear $(s,p)$ Riesz potential for describing the overall aggregation effect. We investigate radial stationary states of the dynamics, showing their relation with extremals of suitable Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities. In the case that aggregation does not dominate over diffusion, radial stationary states also relate to global minimizers of a homogeneous free energy functional featuring the $(s,p)$ energy associated to the nonlinear potential. In the limit as the fractional parameter $s$ tends to zero, the nonlocal interaction term becomes a backward diffusion and we describe the asymptotic behavior of the stationary states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Neumann problem for the equation with the Vladimirov-Taibleson fractional differentiation operator over a non-Archimedean local field. We study weak solutions following the method by Dipierro, Ros-Oton and Valdinoci (2017). Our investigation of strong solutions is based on the ultrametric identities for the operator under consideration.</description>

      <title>Regularity Analysis for Two Coupled Second Order Evolution Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the regularity of the strongly continuous semigroup associated with a system of two coupled second order evolution equations with indirect damping, whose stability was recently studied by Hao et al. By deriving the asymptotic expression of the eigenvalues the generator, we partition the parameter space into several disjoint regions, where the semigroup exhibits either analyticity or Gevrey class regularity. Together with the estimate of the resolvent of the generator on the imaginary axis, we give a complete and sharp regularity characterization for this system.</description>

      <title>Homogenized phase transition model for perforated ferromagnetic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous prediction of the effective equations governing the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition in a perforated three-dimensional body. Assuming a periodic distribution of perforations, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the equations describing the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the material as the period of the microstructure tends to zero. The microscopic model is a phase-field model within the Ginzburg-Landau framework for second-order phase transitions, where the phase-field is directly related to the magnetization vector. This model couples a nonlinear equation for the magnetization with the quasi-static Maxwell system and another nonlinear equation for the temperature. The primary mathematical challenge lies in homogenizing these equations, which exhibit a complex doubly non-linear structure. Additionally, the extension operators used within the homogenization framework precludes the application of standard Aubin--Lions compactness arguments. Our analysis employs two-scale convergence in conjunction with a two-scale decomposition based on an appropriate dilation operator. The nonlinearities are primarily addressed by means of a variant of compensated compactness and a Vitali compactness argument. From the perspective of practical applications, this work enables the explicit calculation of a Curie temperature tensor, capturing at the macroscopic scale the coupled effect of the material's geometric structure and its magnetic permeability tensor.</description>

      <title>Large-friction and incompressible limits for pressureless Euler/isentropic Navier-Stokes flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large-friction and incompressible limits for a two-phase flow (Euler-NS) system which couples the pressureless Euler equations and the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations through a drag force term with the friction coefficient $\frac{1}{\tau}&gt;0$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ($d\geq2$). We establish the uniform regularity estimates with respect to $\tau$ so that the solution of the Cauchy problem for the Euler-NS system exists globally in time, provided that the initial data are uniformly close to the equilibrium state in a critical Besov space. These uniform estimates allow us to rigorously justify the strong convergence of the Euler-NS system to a one-velocity two-phase drift-flux (DF) model as $\tau \to 0$, with an explicit convergence rate of order $\sqrt{\tau}$. We also study the large-time asymptotic behavior of solutions for the Euler-NS system, uniformly with respect to $\tau$. Moreover, when the Mach number $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is considered, we prove the incompressible limit of the DF model toward the Transport-Navier-Stokes (TNS) system as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, and justify the combined large-friction and incompressible limit for the Euler-NS system toward the TNS system in the regime $\tau=\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$. Each singular limit process is globally valid in time for {\emph{ill-prepared}} initial data.</description>

      <title>Existence of transmission eigenvalues for biharmonic scattering by a clamped planar region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the so-called clamped transmission eigenvalue problem. This is a new transmission eigenvalue problem that is derived from the scattering of an impenetrable clamped obstacle in a thin elastic plate. The scattering problem is modeled by a biharmonic wave operator given by the Kirchhoff--Love infinite plate problem in the frequency domain. These scattering problems have not been studied to the extent of other models. Unlike other transmission eigenvalue problems, the problem studied here is a system of homogeneous PDEs defined in all of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This provides unique analytical and computational difficulties when studying the clamped transmission eigenvalue problem. We are able to prove that there exist infinitely many real clamped transmission eigenvalues. This is done by studying the equivalent variational formulation. We also investigate the relationship of the clamped transmission eigenvalues to the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the negative Laplacian for the bounded scattering obstacle.</description>

      <title>On a nonlocal superconductivity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates degenerate nonlocal free boundary problems arising in the context of superconductivity, extending the nonlocal counterpart to the work of Caffarelli, Salazar, and Shahgholian \cite{CS02, CSS04} in the local setting. In these models, no partial differential equation governs the moving sets where the gradient vanishes, meaning that test functions are only required to have a nonzero gradient. Our main results provide interior gradient H\"older regularity estimates for viscosity solutions.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation of phase-field functionals with linear growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a first rigorous homogenisation procedure in image-segmentation models by analysing the relative impact of (possibly random) fine-scale oscillations and phase-field regularisations for a family of elliptic functionals of Ambrosio and Tortorelli type, when the regularised volume term grows \emph{linearly} in the gradient variable. In contrast to the more classical case of superlinear growth, we show that our functionals homogenise to a free-discontinuity energy whose surface term explicitly depends on the jump amplitude of the limit variable. The convergence result as above is obtained under very mild assumptions which allow us to treat, among other, the case of \emph{stationary random integrands}.</description>

This class of memory kernel was not analyzed in previous studies. Moreover, a detailed analysis provides an explicit estimate of the connection between the kernel function's decay constant and the energy's decay constant.</description>

      <title>Breather solutions to nonlinear Maxwell equations with retarded material laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Maxwell's equations for Kerr-type optical materials, which are magnetically inactive and have a nonlinear response to electric fields. This response consists of a linear plus a cubic term, which are both inhomogeneous with bounded coefficients. The cubic term is temporally retarded while the linear term has instantaneous and retarded contributions. For slab waveguides we show existence of breathers, which are time-periodic, real-valued solutions that are localized in the direction perpendicular to the waveguide, and moreover they are traveling along one direction of the waveguide. We find these breathers using a variational method which relies on the assumption that an effective operator related to the linear part of Maxwell's equations has a spectral gap about $0$. We also give examples of material coefficients, including nonperiodic materials, where such a spectral gap is present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend some results presented in \cite{julio} to the case of the $p$-Laplacian operator. More precisely, we consider a model that couples a local $p$-Laplacian operator with a nonlocal $p$-Laplacian operator through source terms in the equation. The resulting problem is associated with an energy functional. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution, which is obtained via the direct minimization of the corresponding energy functional.</description>

      <title>Monodromy Equivalence for Lam\'{e}-type Equations I: Finite-gap Structures and Cone Spherical Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the finite-gap structure of the classical Lam\'{e} equation (1.2) and its central role in mathematical physics, generalized Lam\'{e}-type equations (1.12) are investigated. For the fundamental case $n=1$, a monodromy equivalence between the classical Lam\'{e} equation (1.18) and the generalized Lam\'{e}-type equation (1.19) is established. Two main applications are obtained: (i) the finite-gap structure of \ (1.19) is derived, together with a complete classification of the spectral curves $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ for $\tau\in i\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$; and (ii) the monodromy equivalence is applied to the construction of cone spherical metrics with three large conical singularities, each with cone angle exceeding $2\pi$. A family of such metrics is shown to exhibits a blow-up configuration, which is described explicitly in terms of the monodromy data.</description>

      <title>Curvilinear coordinates and curvature in radiative transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a general expression for the streaming term in radiative transport equa- tions and other transport problems when formulated in curvilinear coordinates, emphasizing coordinate systems adapted to the geometry of the domain and the directional dependence of particle transport. By parametrizing the angular vari- able using a local orthonormal frame, we express directional derivatives in terms of curvature-related quantities that reflect the geometry of underlying spatial man- ifolds. Our formulation highlights how the interaction between coordinate choices and curvature influences the streaming operator, offering geometric interpretations of its components. The resulting framework offers intuitive insight into when and how angular dependence can be simplified and may guide the selection of coordinate systems that balance analytical tractability and computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete, self-contained formulation of the Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization rule for a semiclassical self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ system on the real line, arising from a simple closed curve in phase space. We focus on the case where the principal symbol exhibits eigenvalue crossings within the domain enclosed by the curve -- a situation commonly encountered in Dirac-type operators. Building on earlier work on scalar Bohr--Sommerfeld rules and semiclassical treatments of the Harper operator near rational flux quanta, we identify additional contributions to the quantization condition, and derive concise expressions for general self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ systems. The resulting formulas give explicit geometric phase corrections and clarify when these phases take quantized values.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

Abstract: We study the uniqueness of solutions with a transonic shock in a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with a special metric, which can be regarded as an approximate model of the general physical nozzles, within a class of transonic shock solutions for steady potential flow. We first prove the uniqueness of these solutions on the unit 2-sphere: for given uniform supersonic upstream flow at the entry, there exists a unique uniform pressure at the exit such that a transonic shock solution exists in the sphere, which is unique modulo a translation. A similar result is then extended to a class of manifolds. Mathematically, it is equivalent to showing a uniqueness theorem for a free boundary problem of a second-order elliptic-hyperbolic mixed-type partial differential equation in the general approximate nozzles. The proof is based on the maximum/comparison principle with a suitable special transonic shock solution as a comparison function.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic similarity law for steady compressible Euler flows past slender bodies within the framework of Radon measure solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a mathematical theory on statement and validation of the hypersonic similarity law within the framework of Radon measure solutions of steady compressible Euler equations. We consider two scenarios: (1) two-dimensional steady non-isentropic compressible Euler flows past an infinitely long slender curved wedge; (2) three-dimensional steady non-isentropic compressible Euler flows past an infinitely long axisymmetric cone.
  It turns out that, for the hypersonic flow passing through a slender body with tiny slenderness $\tau$, if the parameter $K\doteq M_{\infty}\tau$ is fixed, by taking $\tau \to 0$ (i.e., the Mach number of the upcoming flow $M_{\infty} \to \infty$), the flow field structures (after scaling) no longer depend on the body's shape and the Mach number $M_{\infty}$ independently, but only on $K$ and adiabatic index $\gamma$ of the polytropic gas. Mathematically, for non-isentropic Euler flows, we find a new system of hypersonic small-disturbance equations to describe steady compressible hypersonic flows passing slender bodies. We demonstrate that as $ \tau \to0$, under suitable non-dimensional scalings, the Radon measure solutions of the original problems of hypersonic flow passing bodies converge to those of corresponding hypersonic small-disturbance problems. The explicit forms of the Radon measure solutions derived for the two scenarios effectively simplify the convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>Random walk on sphere packings and Delaunay triangulations in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that random walks on a family of tilings of d-dimensional Euclidean space, with a canonical choice of conductances, converge to Brownian motion modulo time parameterization. This class of tilings includes Delaunay triangulations (the dual of Voronoi tesselations) and sphere packings. Our regularity assumptions are deterministic and mild. For example, our results apply to Delaunay triangulations with vertices sampled from a d-dimensional Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. As part of our proof, we establish the uniform convergence of certain finite volume schemes for the Laplace equation, with quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence. In the special case of two dimensions, we give a new, short proof of the main result of Gurel-Gurevich--Jerison--Nachmias (2020).</description>

      <title>Local high-degree polynomial integrals of geodesic flows and the generalized hodograph method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Riemannian metrics on 2-surfaces with integrable geodesic flows such that an additional first integral is high-degree polynomial in momenta. This problem reduces to searching for solutions to certain quasi-linear systems of PDEs which turn out to be semi-Hamiltonian. We construct plenty of local explicit and implicit integrable examples with polynomial first integrals of degrees 3, 4, 5. Our construction is essentially based on applying the generalized hodograph method.</description>

      <title>Approximate factorizations for non-symmetric jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first extend the approximate factorization for purely discontinuous Markov process established in \cite{CKSV20} by getting rid of some of the conditions imposed in \cite{CKSV20}. Then we apply the approximate factorization to obtain sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for three classes of processes: stable-like processes with critical killings in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets; killed stable-like processes in the setting of \cite{KW24} in $C^{1, \varepsilon}$ open sets; and non-symmetric stable processes in what we call $C^{1,2{\text - \rm Dini}}$ open sets. In particular, we obtain explicit sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates of killed $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets for all $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and of censored $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets for all $\alpha\in (1, 2)$.</description>
