      <title>Formalization of Aristotle's Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03269v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following paper continues a series of papers we have dedicated formalizing Aristotle's modal syllogistic \cite{pro} and the theory of definition in the Topics \cite{pro2} and well as studying the adequacy for dealing with multiple generality of Aristotelian and other currents of ancient logic\cite{pro3}. Taking the cue from \cite{pro3} we first ask the question: what is the metalogic implicit in the Organon ? We argue that this is plausibly a certain fragment of third-order logic. Not only can we express Aristotle's theorems and proofs in the Analytics (and subsume our system in \cite{pro}) but, following the interpretation of \cite{pro2}, we can express the various topoi in the Topics is a very accurate way such that their variants geared to debate appear as non-trivial logical derivations (which are only left implicit) - thus furnishing further evidence for the sophistication of ancient logic with regards to quantifier logic over non-necessarily monadic predicates.
  The fact that we are dealing here with a variant of second-order logic (to which is added some third-order predicates) allows us to make interesting connections to Frege and to the problems of extensionality and intensionality.
  In this paper we focus on the topoi of genus and property.</description>

      <title>What's the Best Seat in the Game Left, Center, Right?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Left, Center, Right is a popular dice game. We analyze the game using Markov chain and Monte Carlo methods. We compute the expected game length for two to eight players and determine the probability of winning for each player in the game. We discuss the surprising conclusions of which players have the highest and lowest chance of winning, and we propose a small rule change that makes the game a little more fair.</description>

      <title>The Adian-Rabin Theorem -- An English translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an English translation of four remarkable articles, originally written in Russian, by Sergei Ivanovich Adian (1931--2020), supplemented by the translation of two closely related articles by Andrei Andreevich Markov Jr (1903--1979). All six articles concern algorithmic undecidability of various problems for groups and monoids. The articles by S. I. Adian give his proof of the famous "Adian-Rabin Theorem", which shows that there is no algorithm which takes as input a finite presentation of a group together with a "Markov" property $P$ (e.g. being the trivial group, being infinite, etc.), and which outputs whether or not the presented group has property $P$. The articles by A. A. Markov (Jr) give the analogous result for monoids (a significantly easier result), and appeared several years before the group-theoretic analogue. A preface detailing the contents of the articles and some commentary is provided, including the somewhat difficult task of deciding which of Adian's four articles should be considered as containing "the" proof of the Adian-Rabin theorem.</description>
