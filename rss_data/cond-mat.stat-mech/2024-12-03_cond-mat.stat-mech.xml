      <title>Kibble-Zurek mechanism in driven underdamped Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek mechanism is widely known to appear in the transverse-field quantum Ising chain in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature, having notorious characteristics, like the divergence of its relaxation time. In this work, I present the same effect in a simple system, the driven underdamped Brownian motion. Using linear response theory, I show the appropriate limits where the Kibble-Zurek mechanism happens. The divergence of the relaxation time, the high-temperature condition in the initial thermal equilibrium state, a new Kibble-Zurek scaling at sudden processes, and the pausing effect in the optimal protocol are presented as consequences.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Picture for Entanglement Hamiltonians in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the quasiparticle picture of entanglement evolution to obtain an effective description for the out-of-equilibrium Entanglement Hamiltonian at the hydrodynamical scale following quantum quenches in free fermionic systems in two or more spatial dimensions. Specifically, we begin by applying dimensional reduction techniques in cases where the geometry permits, building directly on established results from one-dimensional systems. Subsequently, we generalize the analysis to encompass a wider range of geometries. We obtain analytical expressions for the entanglement Hamiltonian valid at the ballistic scale, which reproduce the known quasiparticle picture predictions for the Renyi entropies and full counting statistics. We also numerically validate the results with excellent precision by considering quantum quenches from several initial configurations.</description>

      <title>Random Tree Model of Meaningful Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and exceptional points in nonreciprocal active polar mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological and synthetic active matter systems consist of different particle types that interact via nonreciprocal couplings. A striking consequence of such interactions is the spontaneous emergence of time-dependent states that break parity-time symmetry. On the field-theoretical level, the transition to these states is marked by so-called exceptional points. However, their precise impact on observable particle dynamics remains poorly understood. In this study, we address this gap by providing a scale-bridging view of a minimal active mixture with nonreciprocal polar interactions. We find that nonreciprocity induces chiral motion on the particle level, yet no full, homogeneous synchronization. Instead, we observe various behaviors, ranging from fully synchronized clusters to chimera-like states. The nonreciprocity-induced spontaneous chirality increases with the degree of nonreciprocity and peaks at coupling strengths associated with exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Markov length: a diagnostic for fault tolerance via mixed-state phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the fault-tolerance of local stabilizer codes experiencing measurement and physical errors and the mixed-state phases of decohered resource states in one higher dimension. Drawing from recent developments in mixed-state phases of matter, this motivates a diagnostic of fault-tolerance, which we refer to as the spacetime Markov length. This is a length scale determined by the decay of the (classical) conditional mutual information of repeated syndrome measurement outcomes in spacetime. The diagnostic is independent of the decoder, and its divergence signals the intrinsic breakdown of fault tolerance. As a byproduct, we find that decoherence may be useful for exposing transitions from higher-form symmetry-protected topological phases driven by both incoherent and coherent perturbations.</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Computing the multimodal stochastic dynamics of a nanobeam in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of small elastic objects in fluid are central to many important and emerging technologies. It is now possible to measure and use the higher modes of motion of elastic structures when driven by Brownian motion alone. Although theoretical descriptions exist for idealized conditions, computing the stochastic multimodal dynamics for the complex conditions of experiment is very challenging. We show that this is possible using deterministic finite element calculations with the fluctuation dissipation theorem by exploring the multimodal stochastic dynamics of a doubly-clamped nanobeam. We use a very general, and flexible, finite-element computational approach to quantify the stochastic dynamics of multiple modes simultaneously using only a single deterministic simulation. We include the experimentally relevant features of an intrinsic tension in the beam and the influence of a nearby rigid boundary on the dynamics through viscous fluid interactions. We quantify the stochastic dynamics of the first eleven flexural modes of the beam when immersed in air or water. We compare the numerical results with theory, where possible, and find excellent agreement. We quantify the limitations of the computational approach and describe its range of applicability. These results pave the way for computational studies of the stochastic dynamics of complex 3D elastic structures in a viscous fluid where theoretical descriptions are not available.</description>

      <title>Collective quantum phases in frustrated arrays of Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collective quantum phases and quantum phase transitions occurring in frustrated sawtooth arrays of small quantum Josephson junctions. Frustration is introduced through the periodic arrangement of $0$- and $\pi$- Josephson junctions with the Josephson coupling energies $\alpha E_\mathrm{J}$ of different signs, $-1\leq \alpha \leq 1$. The complexity of the potential landscape of the system is controlled by the frustration parameter $f=(1-\alpha)/2$. The potential energy has a single global minimum in the non-frustrated regime ($f&lt;f_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$) and a macroscopic number of equal minima in the frustrated regime ($f&gt;f_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$). We address the coherent quantum regime and identify several collective quantum phases: disordered (insulating) and ordered (superconducting) phases in the non-frustrated regime, as well as highly entangled patterns of vortices and anti-vortices in the frustrated regime. These collective quantum phases are controlled by several physical parameters: the frustration $f$, the Josephson coupling, and the charging energies of junctions and islands. We map the control parameter phase diagram by characterizing the quantum dynamics of frustrated Josephson junction arrays by spatially and temporally resolved quantum-mechanical correlation function of the local magnetization.</description>

      <title>Quench Spectroscopy for Dissipative and Non-Hermitian Quantum Lattice Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase submitted to a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions. The latter is investigated by calculating the equations of motion of relevant quadratic correlators permitting to study the equal-time connected one-body and density-density correlations functions. We then compute the quench spectral function associated to each observable to perform the quench spectroscopy of this dissipative quantum lattice model. This permits to unveil the quasiparticle dispersion relation of the Bose-Hubbard chain in the superfluid phase in the presence of loss processes. The applicability of the quench spectroscopy is also generalized to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain in the paramagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into L parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. We show that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a fractal multipartite decomposition: it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction. Building upon this result, we then build exact, analytical tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of generalized Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and universality in stationary state of long-range Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the signature of quantum criticality in the long-time stationary state of the long-range Kitaev chain by performing various quench protocols. In this model, the pairing interaction decays with distance according to a power law with exponent $\alpha$. Using quantum information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and logarithmic negativity, we show that, irrespective of the values of $\alpha$, critical-to-critical quench displays quantum criticality even in the stationary state. Remarkably, in the presence of long-range pairing interactions, where fermionic correlators decay algebraically even at non-critical points, signature of quantum criticality persists in the stationary state. Furthermore, the effective central charge, calculated from both mutual information and logarithmic negativity of stationary state following a critical-to-critical quench, agrees with the central charge of the corresponding ground states for both $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 2$. Therefore, information of the universality class can be inferred from the stationary state.</description>

      <title>First numerical observation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades.
  The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities.
  However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking.
  In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context sensitive grammars (CSG), and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model.
  We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly 0 to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider.
  Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase.
  This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but is generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response depends on the frustration (or its absence) due to the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. Specifically, any minimal loop of blocks that may not simultaneously deform in their softest mode defines a mechanical defect at the vertex (in two dimensions) or edge (in three dimensions) that the loop encircles. Defects stiffen the metamaterial, and allow to design the spatial patterns of stress and deformation as the system is externally loaded. We study the ability to place defects at arbitrary positions in metamaterials made of a family of block types that we recently introduced for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Alongside blocks for which we show that any defect configuration is possible, we identify situations in which not all sets are realizable as defects. One of the restrictions is that in three dimensions, defected edges form closed curves. Even in cases when not all geometries of defect lines are possible, we show how to produce defect lines of arbitrary knottedness.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>

Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significant challenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application during the decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{\hat{O}} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{\hat{O}e^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture the complex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which provides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop model (QLM), along with the quantum dimer model (QDM), are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, these models are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg quantum simulators. However, the effect of finite temperature fluctuations on these quantum constrained models has been barely explored. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite temperature phase diagram of the QLM on the triangular lattice. We discover that the vison plaquette (VP) crystal experiences a finite temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous structural transitions in fluids with competing interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. The study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the Rational-Function Approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal sampling from Gibbs states via non-commutative optimal transport metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from and preparing quantum Gibbs states of local commuting Hamiltonians on hypercubic lattices of arbitrary dimension. We prove that any such Gibbs state which satisfies a clustering condition that we coin decay of matrix-valued quantum conditional mutual information (MCMI) can be quasi-optimally prepared on a quantum computer. We do this by controlling the mixing time of the corresponding Davies evolution in a normalized quantum Wasserstein distance of order one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a non-commutative transport metric has been used in the study of quantum dynamics, and the first time quasi-rapid mixing is implied by solely an explicit clustering condition. Our result is based on a weak approximate tensorization and a weak modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for such systems, as well as a new general weak transport cost inequality. If we furthermore assume a constraint on the local gap of the thermalizing dynamics, we obtain rapid mixing in trace distance for interactions beyond the range of two, thereby extending the state-of-the-art results that only cover the nearest neighbor case. We conclude by showing that systems that admit effective local Hamiltonians, like quantum CSS codes at high temperature, satisfy this MCMI decay and can thus be efficiently prepared and sampled from.</description>

Abstract: G\'acs' coarse-grained algorithmic entropy leverages universal computation to quantify the information content of any given physical state. Unlike the Boltzmann and Gibbs-Shannon entropies, it requires no prior commitment to macrovariables or probabilistic ensembles, rendering it applicable to settings arbitrarily far from equilibrium. For measure-preserving dynamical systems equipped with a Markovian coarse-graining, we prove a number of fluctuation inequalities. These include algorithmic versions of Jarzynski's equality, Landauer's principle, and the second law of thermodynamics. In general, the algorithmic entropy determines a system's actual capacity to do work from an individual state, whereas the Gibbs-Shannon entropy only gives the mean capacity to do work from a state ensemble that is known a priori.</description>

      <title>Symmetries as Ground States of Local Superoperators: Hydrodynamic Implications</title>

Abstract: Symmetry algebras of quantum many-body systems with locality can be understood using commutant algebras, which are defined as algebras of operators that commute with a given set of local operators. In this work, we show that these symmetry algebras can be expressed as frustration-free ground states of a local superoperator, which we refer to as a ``super-Hamiltonian". We demonstrate this for conventional symmetries such as $Z_2$, $U(1)$, and $SU(2)$, where the symmetry algebras map to various kinds of ferromagnetic ground states, as well as for unconventional ones that lead to weak ergodicity breaking phenomena of Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars. In addition, we show that the low-energy excitations of this super-Hamiltonian can be understood as approximate symmetries, which in turn are related to slowly relaxing hydrodynamic modes in symmetric systems. This connection is made precise by relating the super-Hamiltonian to the superoperator that governs the operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits, and this physical interpretation also provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions. We find examples of gapped/gapless super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence/presence of slow-modes, which happens in the presence of discrete/continuous symmetries. In the gapless cases, we recover hydrodynamic modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry, Hilbert space fragmentation, and a tower of quantum scars respectively. In all, this demonstrates the power of the commutant algebra framework in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of exact symmetries, and associated approximate symmetries and hydrodynamic modes, and their dynamical consequences in systems with locality.</description>

Abstract: Generative diffusion models apply the concept of Langevin dynamics in physics to machine leaning, attracting a lot of interests from engineering, statistics and physics, but a complete picture about inherent mechanisms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a transparent physics analysis of diffusion models, formulating the fluctuation theorem, entropy production, equilibrium measure, and Franz-Parisi potential to understand the dynamic process and intrinsic phase transitions. Our analysis is rooted in a path integral representation of both forward and backward dynamics, and in treating the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder akin to that in spin glass theory. Our study thus links stochastic thermodynamics, statistical inference and geometry based analysis together to yield a coherent picture about how the generative diffusion models work.</description>

Abstract: The presence of erratic or unstable paths in standard kinetic Monte Carlo simulations significantly undermines the accurate simulation and sampling of transition pathways. While typically reliable methods, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are employed to simulate such paths, they encounter challenges in efficiently identifying rare events due to their sequential nature and reliance on exact Monte Carlo sampling. In contrast, the weighted ensemble method effectively samples rare events and accelerates the exploration of complex reaction pathways by distributing computational resources among multiple replicas, where each replica is assigned a weight reflecting its importance, and evolves independently from the others. Here, we implement the highly efficient and robust weighted ensemble method to model susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics on large heterogeneous population networks, and explore the interplay between stochasticity and contact heterogeneity which ultimately gives rise to disease clearance. Studying a wide variety of networks characterized by fat-tailed asymmetric degree distributions, we are able to compute the mean time to extinction and quasi-stationary distribution around it in previously-inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

Abstract: We use kinetic theory and the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to derive the hydrodynamics of spin transport in the Haldane-Shastry chain. We obtain analytical expressions for relaxation from weak-domain-wall initial conditions and corresponding predictions for the spin Drude weight. We corroborate the latter against an exact microscopic calculation at infinite temperature and Luttinger-liquid expectations at zero temperature. We further obtain an analytical expression for the long-wavelength dynamics of the longitudinal spin structure factor at all fillings and temperatures. We show that the latter interpolates between an empirically exact expression that we have found at infinite temperature and the long-wavelength limit of the Haldane-Zirnbauer formula at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.15518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states (also known as "squeezed coherent states") can be uniquely characterized by their linear complex structure $J$ which is a linear map on the classical phase space. This extends conventional Gaussian methods based on covariance matrices and provides a unified framework to treat bosons and fermions simultaneously. Pure Gaussian states can be identified with the triple $(G,\Omega,J)$ of compatible K\"ahler structures, consisting of a positive definite metric $G$, a symplectic form $\Omega$ and a linear complex structure $J$ with $J^2=-1\!\!1$. Mixed Gaussian states can also be identified with such a triple, but with $J^2\neq -1\!\!1$. We apply these methods to show how computations involving Gaussian states can be reduced to algebraic operations of these objects, leading to many known and some unknown identities. We apply these methods to the study of (A) entanglement and complexity, (B) dynamics of stable systems, (C) dynamics of driven systems. From this, we compile a comprehensive list of mathematical structures and formulas to compare bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states side-by-side.</description>

Abstract: The local equilibration time of quantum many-body systems has been conjectured to satisfy a `Planckian bound', $\tau_{\rm eq}\gtrsim \frac{\hbar}{T}$. We provide a sharp and universal definition of this time scale, and show that it is bounded below by the strong coupling scale of diffusive fluctuations, which can be expressed in terms of familiar transport parameters. When applied to quantum field theories at finite temperature, this fluctuation bound implies the Planckian bound. The fluctuation bound moreover applies to any local thermalizing system, and we study its implication for correlated insulators, metals, as well as disordered fixed points, where it can be used to establish a lower bound on the diffusivity in terms of the specific heat $D\gtrsim 1/(c_V^{2/d}\tau_{\rm eq})$. Finally, we discuss how the local equilibration time can be directly measured in experiments.</description>

Abstract: In quantum many-body spin systems, the interplay between the entangling effect of multi-qubit Pauli measurements and the disentangling effect of single-qubit Pauli measurements may give rise to two competing effects. By introducing a randomized measurement pattern with such bases, a phase transition can be induced by altering the ratio between them. In this work, we numerically investigate a measurement-based model associated with the $(2+1)$d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fradkin-Shenker Hamiltonian model, encompassing the deconfining, confining, and Higgs phases. We determine the phase diagram in our measurement-only model by employing entanglement measures. For the bulk topological order, we use the topological entanglement entropy. We also use the mutual information between separated boundary regions to diagnose the boundary phase transition associated with the Higgs or the bulk SPT phase. We observe the structural similarity between our phase diagram and the one in the standard quantum Hamiltonian formulation of the Fradkin-Shenker model with the open rough boundary. First, a deconfining phase is detected by nonzero and constant topological entanglement entropy. Second, we find a (boundary) phase transition curve separating the Higgs=SPT phase from the rest. In certain limits, the topological phase transitions reside at the critical point of the formation of giant homological cycles in the bulk 3d spacetime lattice, as well as the bond percolation threshold of the boundary 2d spacetime lattice when it is effectively decoupled from the bulk. Additionally, there are analogous mixed-phase properties at a certain region of the phase diagram, emerging from how we terminate the measurement-based procedure. Our findings pave an alternative pathway to study the physics of Higgs=SPT phases on quantum devices in the near future.</description>

      <title>Using rare event algorithms to understand the statistics and dynamics of extreme heatwave seasons in South Asia</title>

Abstract: Computing the return times of extreme events and assessing the impact of climate change on such return times is fundamental to extreme event attribution studies. However, the rarity of such events in the observational record makes this task a challenging one, even more so for "record-shattering" events that have not been previously observed at all. While climate models could be used to simulate such extremely rare events, such an approach entails a huge computational cost: gathering robust statistics for events with return time of centuries would require a few thousand years of simulation.
  In this study, we use an innovative tool, rare event algorithm, that allows to sample numerous extremely rare events at a much lower cost than direct simulations. We employ the algorithm to sample extreme heatwave seasons, corresponding to large anomalies of the seasonal average temperature, in a heatwave hotspot of South Asia using the global climate model Plasim. We show that the algorithm estimates the return levels of extremely rare events with much greater precision than traditional statistical fits. It also enables the computation of various composite statistics, whose accuracy is demonstrated through comparison with a very long control run. In particular, our results reveal that extreme heatwave seasons are associated with an anticyclonic anomaly embedded within a large-scale hemispheric quasi-stationary wave-pattern. Additionally, the algorithm accurately represents the intensity-duration-frequency statistics of sub-seasonal heatwaves, offering insights into both seasonal and sub-seasonal aspects of extreme heatwave seasons. This innovative approach could be used in extreme event attribution studies to better constrain the changes in event's probability and intensity with global warming, particularly for events with return times spanning centuries or millennia.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effect in Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The essence of the Mpemba effect is that non-equilibrium systems may relax faster the further they are from their equilibrium configuration. In the quantum realm, this phenomenon arises in the dynamics of closed systems, where it is witnessed by fundamental features such as symmetry and entanglement. Here, we study the quantum Mpemba effect in charge-preserving random circuits on qudits combining extensive numerical simulations and analytical arguments. We show that the more asymmetric certain classes of initial states (tilted ferromagnets) are, the faster they restore symmetry and reach the grand-canonical ensemble. Conversely, other classes of states (tilted antiferromagnets) do not show the Mpemba effect. We provide a simple and general mechanism underlying the effect, based on the spreading of nonconserved operators in terms of conserved densities. Our analysis is based on minimal principles -- locality, unitarity, and symmetry. Consequently, our results represent a significant advancement in clarifying the emergence of Mpemba physics in chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Conditioning the complexity of random landscapes on marginal optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marginal optima are minima or maxima of a function with many nearly flat directions. In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to attract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of marginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima and other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for conditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their marginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively different structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is Gaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are Gaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which are non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the distribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in the minority.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of domino tilings on a pentagonal domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>

      <title>Extracting the symmetries of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating Stark MBL with Continuous Unitary Transformation Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ergodicity-to-localization transition in interacting fermion systems subjected to a spatially uniform electric field. For that we employ the recently proposed Tensorflow Equations (TFE), a type of continuous unitary flow equations. This enables us to iteratively determine an approximate diagonal basis of the quantum many-body system. We present improvements to the method, which achieves good accuracy at small to intermediate interaction strengths, even in the absence of an electric field or disorder. Then, we examine two quantities that reveal the fate of Stark MBL in 1D and 2D. First, we investigate the structure of the resulting basis to determine the crossover between ergodic and localized regimes with respect to electric field strength. Second, we simulate long-time dynamics at infinite temperature. Our results in 1D show a localization transition at non-zero field for finite interaction that vanishes with increasing system size leading to localization at infinitesimally small field even in the presence of interactions. In 2D we find less clear signatures of localization and strong finite size effects. We establish that the TFE work accurately up to intermediate times but cannot capture higher order effects in interaction strength that lead to delocalization at longer times in finite-size Stark MBL systems.</description>

      <title>Transdimensional Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\leq d\leq 6$. The new parameter $\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects.</description>
