      <title>Developing a Complete AI-Accelerated Workflow for Superconductor Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of materials discovery has continually transformed, progressing from empirical experimentation to virtual high-throughput screening, which leverages computational techniques to fully characterize a material before synthesis. Despite the successes of these approaches, significant bottlenecks remain due to the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) calculations required to determine the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of a material and its functional properties. In particular, discovering new superconductors is massively impeded by the cost of computing the electron-phonon spectral functions, which limits the feasible materials space. Recent advances in machine learning offer an opportunity to accelerate the superconductor discovery workflow by developing machine-learning-based surrogates for DFT. Here we present a Bootstrapped Ensemble of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (BEE-NET), a ML model that predicts the Eliashberg spectral function achieves a test mean absolute error of 0.87 K for the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), relative to predictions of the Allen-Dynes equation using DFT-derived spectral functions. BEE-NET simultaneously identifies candidate structures with $T_c &gt; 5$ K at a precision of 86% and a true negative rate of 99.4%. Combined with elemental substitution and ML interatomic potentials, this models puts us in position to develop a complete AI-accelerated workflow to identify novel superconductors. The workflow achieved 87% precision, narrowing 1.3 million candidates to 741 stable compounds with DFT-confirmed $T_c &gt; 5$ K. We report the prediction and successful experimental synthesis, characterization, and verification of two novel superconductors. This work exemplifies the potential of integrating machine learning, computational methods, and experimental techniques to revolutionize the field of materials discovery.</description>

      <title>$\pi$/4 phase shift in the angular magnetoresistance of infinite layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in nickelates has generated significant interest in condensed matter physics. Nickelate superconductors, which are hole-doped within the layered structure of RNiO$_2$, share structural similarities with high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. However, despite similarities in formal valence and crystal symmetry, the fundamental nature of the superconducting state and the parent compound phase in nickelates remains elusive. Strong electronic correlations in infinite-layer nickelates suggest a potentially complex phase diagram, akin to that observed in cuprates, yet a key question about the magnetic ground state remains unanswered. Through magnetoresistance measurements across varying field strengths and orientations, we observe distinct angular-dependent magnetoresistance (AMR) oscillations with four-fold symmetry. Notably, this four-fold symmetry displays a $\pi/4$ phase shift with doping or applied magnetic field. Our findings parallel behaviors in electron-doped cuprates, suggesting that a static or quasi-static magnetic order exists in the infinite-layer nickelates, echoing characteristics of electron-doped cuprates. Furthermore, our modeling of the system reveals that the AMR is directly related to the underlying antiferromagnetic order, reinforcing this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Fixed points and critical temperature near quantum critical points in $d$-wave cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior driven by potential quantum critical points (QCPs) termed as $\tau_{0,x,y,z}$-Type QCPs in the $d$-wave cuprate superconductors. Within the framework of the renormalization group approach, we construct the coupled flow equations of all interaction parameters and obtain several unique properties. On one hand, the interaction parameters flow toward several fixed points (FPs) at certain critical energy scales. We identify two different types of FPs designated at the clean limit. FP-I is characterized by the divergence of the quadratic parameter and exhibits robustness against variations in interaction parameters. In contrast, FP-II is dominated by the cubic and quartic interaction parameters, and it is sensitive to initial conditions, leading to five subclasses. Besides, we find that disorder scattering can influence fermion velocities and critical energy scales, and even destabilize certain FPs around the $\tau_{x,z}$-QCPs, driving the system toward a preempted disorder-induced FP. On the other hand, we find that quantum fluctuations play a critical role in shaping the critical temperature ($T_c$) as the system approaches these QCPs. Near the $\tau_x$-QCP, $T_c$ is considerably suppressed for both FP-I and FP-II. In contrast, near the $\tau_0$-QCP, $T_c$ undergoes a substantial decrease for FP-I but only a slight decrease for FP-II. Conversely, $T_c$ exhibits an increasing trend near the $\tau_y$-QCP, with a pronounced peak at $v_{\Delta 0}/v_{F0} \sim 0.25$. However, numerical analysis suggests that the $\tau_z$-QCP is unlikely to be physically realizable. Additionally, we realize that $T_c$ can also be modified by the emergence of disorder-induced FPs in the vicinity of the $\tau_x$-QCP. These findings would provide valuable insights into the critical low-energy properties of $d$-wave cuprate superconductors and related materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Degeneracy Induced Flat Bands in two-Dimensional Holed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems hosting flat bands offer a powerful platform for exploring strong correlation physics. Theoretically topological degeneracy rising in systems with non-trivial topological orders on periodic manifolds of non-zero genus can generate ideal flat bands. However, experimental realization of such geometrically engineered systems is very difficult. In this work, we demonstrate that flat planes with strategically patterned hole defects can engineer ideal flat bands. We constructing two families of models, singular flat band systems where degeneracy is stabilized by non-contractible loop excitations tied to hole defects and perfectly nested van Hove systems where degeneracy arises from line excitations in momentum space. These models circumvent the need for exotic manifolds while retaining the essential features of topological flat bands. By directly linking defect engineering to degeneracy mechanisms, our results establish a scalable framework for experimentally accessible flat band design.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of lattice and charge order excitations in a superconducting cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquitous tendency of high-temperature superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves has reignited interest in the enigmatic nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their complex phase diagrams. While pronounced anomalies in the dispersion of several phonon branches have been reported, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under extreme conditions of low temperature and high magnetic field we uncover a striking renormalization of the phonon spectra in the model cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting two emblematic CDW states: a two-dimensional short-range CDW emerging above the superconducting transition and a three-dimensional long-range CDW that appears only when superconductivity is suppressed by a strong magnetic field or uniaxial compression. The spectral changes are strongest at the wave vector corresponding to the 3D CDW order despite the fact that the CDW is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models and instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive charge-density-wave excitations. These results provide fresh insights into the intricate interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Picosecond Josephson Samplers: Modeling and Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of signals generated by superconducting Josephson junction (JJ) circuits require ultra-fast components located in close proximity to the generating circuitry. We report a detailed study of optimal design criteria for a JJ-based sampler which balances the highest sampler bandwidth (shortest 10\%--90\% rise time) with minimal sampled waveform distortion. We explore the impacts on performance of a sampler, realized using a single underdamped JJ as the logical sampling element (the comparator), due to the type of signal-comparator coupling scheme that is utilized (galvanic, inductive, or capacitive). In these simulations we emulate the entire waveform reconstruction sampling process, via comparator threshold detection, while sweeping the time location at which the waveform is being sampled. We extract the sampled waveform rise time (or FWHM) as a function of the comparator's Stewart-McCumber parameter and as a function of the coupling strength between the device under test and comparator. Based on our simulation results we design, fabricate, and characterize a cryocooled (3.6 K operating temperature) JJ sampler utilizing the NIST state-of-the-art Nb/amorphous-Si/Nb junctions. We separately sample a step signal and impulse generator co-located on-chip with the comparator and sampling strobe generator by implementing the same binary search comparator threshold detection technique during sampler operation as is used in simulation. With this technique the system is fully-digital and automated and operation of the fabricated device directly mirrors simulation. Our sampler technology shows a 10\%--90\% rise time of 3.3 ps and the capability to measure transient pulse widths of 2.5 ps FWHM. A linear systems analysis of sampled waveforms indicate a 3 dB bandwidth of 225 GHz, but we demonstrate effective measurement of signals well above this -- as high as 600 GHz.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic phase fluctuation and superfluid density in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The doping dependence of the superfluid density $\rho_{\text{s}}$ exhibits distinct behaviors in the underdoping and overdoping regimes of the cuprate, while the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_c$ is generally scaled with $\rho_{\text{s}}$. In this paper, we present a unified understanding of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ across the entire doping range by incorporating the underlying mutual Chern-Simons gauge structure that couples the spin and charge degrees of freedom in the doped Mott insulator. Within this framework, the SC phase fluctuations are deeply intertwined with the spin dynamics, such that thermally excited neutral spins determine $T_c$, while quantum spin excitations effectively reduce the superfluid density at zero temperature. As a result, a Uemura-like scaling of $T_c$ vs. $\rho_{\text{s}}$ in the underdoped regime naturally emerges, while the suppression of both $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ at overdoping is attributed to a drastic reduction of antiferromagnetic spin correlations.</description>

      <title>Novel Easy-Axis Switching through Metamagnetism in CeSb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel magnetic field-induced switching of the magnetization easy axis has been discovered in the layered compound CeSb$_2$, which crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with nearly identical lattice constants along the a- and b-axes, giving it a tetragonal-like appearance. When a magnetic field is applied along an orthorhombic in-plane axis at 4.2 K, magnetization increases abruptly around 34 T, followed by a hysteresis loop upon decreasing the field. Subsequent measurements reveal a significantly enhanced magnetization, indicative of a switch of the magnetization easy axis. Conversely, the other orthorhombic in-plane axis becomes the magnetization hard axis. Surprisingly, the easy axis is switchable by changing the field direction to the other orthorhombic in-plane axis. Moreover, this memory effect is stable up to room temperature. Polarized light microscope images have visually revealed domain formation of the as-cast samples and domain rearrangement by magnetic fields. This intriguing axis-conversion phenomenon is a novel magnetic shape memory effect for heat cycles up to room temperature. It is attributed to the specific in-plane Ce-pantograph networks in CeSb$_2$.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Lyapunov quantum control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: strain to mimic the effects pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed, bringing the apical Ni-O-Ni angle to 180$^\circ$ and causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Due to this strong interlayer coupling, a flat band of pure $d_{z^2}$ character crosses the Fermi level. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure: while compressive strain brings the apical Ni-O-Ni angle closer to 180$^\circ$, it shifts the $d_{z^2}$ flat bands away from the Fermi energy, giving rise to a more cuprate-like electronic structure. In contrast, tensile strain reduces the apical Ni-O-Ni angle (to values $\sim$ 160$^\circ$), but it recovers the flat $d_{z^2}$ band at the Fermi level appearing in the bilayer and trilayer RPs under pressure. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity at ambient pressure in this family of materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the superconductivity of bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been observed in the thin film at ambient pressure, facilitated by epitaxial strain. Here, we investigate the effects of film thickness and carrier doping on the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7 thin films with thickness of 0.5-3 unit cells (UC) using first-principles calculations. At an optimal doping concentration of 0.4 holes per formula unit for 2UC film, the Ni-"d" _("z" ^"2" ) interlayer bonding state metallizes, leading to the formation of {\gamma} pockets at the Fermi surface, which quantitatively matches the experimental results of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). These findings provide theoretical support for recent experimental observations of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films and highlight the crucial role of film thickness and carrier doping in modulating electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Probing Mixed Valence States by Nuclear Spin-Spin Relaxation Time Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several elements in the periodic table exhibit an interesting and often overlooked feature: They skip certain valence states which is discussed in the field of superconductivity to be in favor of fostering higher transition temperatures $T_c$. However, from the experimental point of view, it is often deemed difficult to probe changes in the valence state. Here we demonstrate that the latter are accessible by the spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ in nuclear magnetic resonance. As target material, we chose the solid solution Ge$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te, where valence-skipping In induces superconductivity and changes its valence state as a function of $x$. We observe a strong enhancement in $1/T_2(x)$ and, most importantly, find that $1/T_2$ and $T_c$ exhibit a strikingly similar $x$ dependence. These results underline the importance of valence physics for the evolution of superconductivity in Ge$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te. A model based on a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type of interaction among the In nuclei is proposed which fully accounts for the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Theory of Two-level Tunneling Systems in Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a field theory formulation for the interaction of an ensemble of two-level tunneling systems (TLS) with the electronic states of a superconductor. Predictions for the impact of two-level tunneling systems on superconductivity are presented, including $T_c$ and spectrum of quasiparticle states for conventional BCS superconductors. We show that non-magnetic TLS impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors can act as pair-breaking or pair-enhancing defects depending on the level population of the distribution of TLS impurities. We present calculations of the enhancement of superconductivity, both $T_c$ and the order parameter, for TLS defects in thermal equilibrium with the electrons and lattice. The scattering of quasiparticles by TLS impurities leads to sub-gap states below the bulk excitation gap, $\Delta$, as well as resonances in the continuum above $\Delta$. The energies and spectral weights of these states depend on the distribution of tunnel splittings, while the spectral weights are particularly sensitive to the level occupation of the TLS impurities. Under microwave excitation, or decoupling from the thermal bath, a nonequilibrium level population of the TLS distribution generates subgap quasiparticle states near the Fermi level which contribute to dissipation and thus degrade the performance of superconducting devices at low temperatures.</description>

Abstract: In the self-consistent approximation for the two-dimensional mean-field model we found an analytic solution for the ground state with a coexisting d-wave symmetric bond ordered pair density wave (PDW) and spin (SDW) or charge (CDW) density waves, as observed in some high-temperature superconductors. In particular, the solution gives the same periodicity for CDW and PDW, and a pseudogap in the Fermi-excitation spectrum.</description>
