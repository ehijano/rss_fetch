      <title>Tunable 300 W single-frequency 2 micron fiber amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-fiber design for a Tm-based fiber amplifier that can tune over 1992-2065 nm with 300-350 W single-frequency (&lt;100 kHz) output. Over 180 W is achieved out to 2085 nm with &lt;10% ASE content without utilizing in-line spectral filtering. The amplifier employs both Tm- and Tm/Ho-doped gain fibers in two preamplifier stages in addition to longer sections of Tm fiber to extend the bandwidth of the Tm-based high-power amplifier to longer wavelengths (&gt;2050 nm). Efficiencies of 55% are realized across the full bandwidth. Roll-off occurs beyond 2085 nm where ASE becomes intractable. The amplifier has an average M^2 value of 1.39 at high-power due to the presence of light guided within the fiber pedestal. Estimates of the pedestal light and higher-order mode contents are provided.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical self-assembly of Brownian particle-like pulses in a modelocked laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive modelocking involves self-locking of thousands of frequency modes to form ultrashort pulses. In fundamental modelocking, a single intracavity pulse provides high stability and reproducibility, but limits the repetition rate. Harmonic modelocking can overcome this by supporting multiple pulses, but suffers from instabilities and poor reproducibility, with specific states achievable only sporadically. Biology exploits hierarchy to organise complexity, which has inspired hierarchical self-assembly in the laboratory. Here, building on the Brownian-particle characteristics of modelocked pulses, we introduce a theoretical framework that treats multi-pulse modelocking as a hierarchical self-assembly problem. This involves timescales spanning up to 14 orders of magnitude, yet with a natural hierarchy in which fast variables are slaved to slower ones. We exploit this hierarchy to reduce their complex dynamics into nested low-dimensional subsystems governing pulse shape, energy, gain, and positions. The resulting framework reveals how to reliably reach target states with precise pulse number and spacing. We experimentally validate the predictions in a Mamyshev laser with over 100 pulses, limited only by available power. Our framework could extend to spatiotemporal modelocking by treating it as coupled pulses distributed across spatial modes and may also guide hierarchical strategies for laser-driven self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Novel phase unwrapping approach based on lateral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase unwrapping plays a key role in obtaining a ground-truth phase of the wrapped phase. High-accurate unwrapped phases are demanded in various research fields such as optical holography, optical diffraction tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Unfortunately, the ground-truth phase is not accessible due to 2pi ambiguity which arises from phase jumps in the wrapped phase. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the accuracy of unwrapping process. We increase the sampling frequency by employing a magnifying objective to reconstruct the unwrapped phase with high accuracy for the application of optical holography. Our result shows that optical magnification enables us to improve the accuracy of the true phase by 42%. We deeply believe that our approach will demonstrate significant achievement in obtaining ground-truth phases in various research fields such as optical holography, magnetic resonance imaging, and optical diffraction tomography.</description>

      <title>On-chip room-temperature CW lasing from a III-V nanowire integrated with a Si photonic crystal platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the demonstration of continuous-wave (CW) lasing at room temperature from a III-V semiconductor nanowire integrated into a Si photonic crystal (PhC) cavity. Conventional hybrid nanowire lasers [M. Takiguchi. et.al., APL Photonics, 2, 046106 (2017)], which typically feature circular nanowire-cross-sections, suffer from a weak optical confinement, preventing CW lasing under ambient conditions. To overcome this limitation, we fabricated nanowires with rectangular cross-sections via dry etching and integrated them into the air trenches of Si PhC cavities formed using atomic force microscope tips. This configuration forms a hybrid photonic crystal cavity with an improved optical confinement. As a result, we achieved room-temperature CW oscillation from a single nanowire, representing a significant step toward on-chip nanophotonic light sources. This unique in-plane integration of the nanolaser in the same plane as the Si slab rather than on top of the substrate will contribute to the development of compact, scalable, and CMOS-compatible photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Broadband spectral mapping of photo-induced second-harmonic generation in silicon nitride microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing a pump-probe technique for enhanced spectral mapping of the dynamics in nonlinear frequency conversion, we demonstrate that photo-induced second-harmonic generation (SHG) in silicon nitride (Si3N4) microresonators can persist when transitioning from the preferred doubly resonant condition--where the resonances of the optical harmonics are required to be matched--to a highly detuned state where the generated second harmonic is significantly shifted away from its corresponding resonance. This results in an unconventionally broad conversion bandwidth. Other intriguing phenomena, such as detuning-dependent all-optical poling and nonlinear multi-mode interaction, are also presented for the first time with direct experimental evidence. Our findings provide new insights into the physics of photo-induced second-order (\chi^{(2)}) nonlinearity, highlighting its potential applications for nonlinear \chi^{(2)} photonics in integrated Si3N4 platform</description>

      <title>Mapping complex optical light field distributions with single fluorescent molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single fluorescent molecules, behaving as ideal electric dipole emitters, are powerful nanoscopic probes of complex optical fields. Here, this property is exploited to precisely map the polarization and vectorial structure of tightly focused laser beams, utilizing both linear and circular polarization states. The resulting three-dimensional fluorescence excitation maps strikingly reveal the intrinsic chiral and non-chiral structure of the light field, in perfect quantitative agreement with a full vectorial wave-optical model. This precise correspondence not only enables the reliable determination of absolute molecular orientations but also allows for the accurate characterization of the field's properties. These results fundamentally advance our understanding of light-matter interaction at the single-molecule level and open new avenues for characterizing complex light fields, with broad applications in super-resolution microscopy and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Bright Spot with Mie Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work applies Mie scattering theory to provide a new perspective on the propagation of light through a spherical obstacle, offering a novel explanation for the formation of the Poisson spot (also known as the Arago or Fresnel spot). We demonstrate that the diffraction patterns generated by a sphere and by a circular disk can be understood as complementary outcomes of the same underlying scattering process. Our analysis highlights the constructive interference responsible for the bright central spot, and extends the classical wave optics framework by connecting it directly with the scattering coefficients of spherical harmonics. This approach not only deepens the theoretical understanding of diffraction phenomena, but also provides a practical framework that may be applied in modern optical experiments and photonic device design.</description>

      <title>The Fourier modal method for gratings with bi-anisotropic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an advanced formulation of the Fourier modal method developed for two-dimensionally periodic multilayered structures containing materials with non-zero macroscopic magneto-electric coefficients (also known as coefficients of chirality and bi-anisotropy) represented as arbitrary 3 by 3 tensors. We consider two numerical schemes for this formulation: with and without Lifeng Li factorization rules. For both schemes, we provide explicit expressions for the Fourier tensors of macroscopic material parameters and demonstrate that, in the absence of magneto-electric coupling, they reduce to conventional Li operators. We show that the scheme employing factorization rules facilitates improved convergence, even when the macroscopic chirality coefficient is large. The described formulation represents the fast and rigorous technique for theoretical studies of periodic structures with chiral, bi-anisotropic, or non-reciprocal materials in the widely used framework of the Fourier modal method.</description>

      <title>General diffraction properties of aperiodic slit arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fraunhofer diffraction plays a vital role in experimental physics not only because it accurately describes the behaviour of light in the usual propagation limit, but also because it links the diffracted light with the scattering object through one of the most important mathematical transformations in physics: the Fourier transform. Acting as a probe in material characterisation as well as used as a tool for particle trapping or sensing, the pattern of interference maxima resulting from the Fraunhofer diffraction through periodic scattering is an ubiquitous routine. In this paper we analyse the Fraunhofer diffraction resulting from the much less studied aperiodic scatter of the light. We provide general conditions for the experimental observation of the peaks of interference maxima featured into patterns that display periodic structures on a number of distance scales. Our theoretical analysis is supported by thorough experimental demonstrations.</description>

      <title>An integrated photonic millimeter-wave receiver with sub-ambient noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades of progress in radiofrequency (RF) transistors and receiver frontends have profoundly impacted wireless communications, remote sensing, navigation, and instrumentation. Growing demands for data throughput in 6G networks, timing precision in positioning systems, and resolution in atmospheric sensing and automotive radar have pushed receiver frontends into the millimeter-wave (mmW) and sub-mmW/THz regimes. At these frequencies, however, the noise performance of field-effect transistors (FETs) degrades rapidly due to parasitic effects, limited carrier mobility, hot electrons, and shot noise. Parametric transducers that couple electromagnetic signals to optical fields offer quantum-limited sensitivity at room temperature. Electro-optic materials enable receivers that convert RF signals into optical phase shifts. While early demonstrations used resonant devices and recent efforts have focused on cryogenic microwave-to-optical quantum transduction, room-temperature electro-optic receivers have yet to achieve noise figures comparable to their electronic counterparts. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature integrated cavity electro-optic mmW receiver on a lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) photonic integrated circuit with 2.5% on-chip photon-number transduction efficiency, achieving 250 K noise temperature at 59.33 GHz--matching state-of-the-art LNAs. We report the first direct resolution of thermal noise in cavity electro-optic transduction, showing the system is fundamentally limited by thermal photon occupation (~100) in the mmW cavity. Our work establishes integrated photonics as a path to surpass electronic LNAs while offering exceptional resilience to strong electromagnetic inputs and immunity to EMI, establishing cavity electro-optics as a low-noise, chip-scale, EMI-resilient receiver frontend for mmW applications and scalable analog processing in the optical domain.</description>

      <title>Trends in porous media laboratory imaging and open science practices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding processes in porous media is fundamental to a broad spectrum of environmental, energy, and geoscience applications. These processes include multiphase fluid transport, interfacial dynamics, reactive transformations, and interactions with solids or microbial components, all governed by wettability, capillarity, and reactive transport at fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces. Laboratory-based multiscale imaging provides critical insights into these phenomena, enabling direct visualization and quantitative characterization from the nanometer to meter scale. It is essential for advancing predictive models and optimizing the design of subsurface and engineered porous systems. This review presents an integrated overview of imaging techniques relevant to porous media research, emphasizing the type of information each method can provide, their applicability to porous media systems, and their inherent limitations. We highlight how imaging data are combined with quantitative analyses and modeling to bridge pore-scale mechanisms with continuum-scale behavior, and we critically discuss current challenges such as limited spatio-temporal resolution, sample representativity, and restricted data accessibility. We conduct an in-depth analysis on open-science trends in experimental and computational porous media research and find that, while open-access publishing has become widespread, the availability of imaging data and analysis code remains limited, often restricted to 'upon request'. Finally, we underscore the importance of open sharing of imaging datasets to enable reproducibility, foster cross-disciplinary integration, and support the development of robust predictive frameworks for porous media systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically levitated and cooled nanoparticles are a new quantum system whose application to the creation of non-classical states of motion and quantum limited sensing is fundamentally limited by recoil and bulk heating. We study the creation of stable 3D optical traps using optical cylindrically polarized vortex beams with radial and azimuthal polarization and show that a significant reduction in recoil heating by up to an order of magnitude can be achieved when compared with conventional single Gaussian beam tweezers. Additionally these beams allow trapping of larger particles outside the Rayleigh regime using both bright and dark tweezer trapping with reduced recoil heating. By changing the wavelength of the trapping laser, or the size of the particles, non-linear and repulsive potentials of interest for the creation of non-classical states of motion can also be created.</description>

      <title>Implementation of multiparticle quantum speed limits on observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy-time uncertainty relation limits the maximum speed of quantum system evolution and is crucial for determining whether quantum tasks can be accelerated. However, multiparticle quantum speed limits have not been experimentally explored. In this work, we experimentally verify that both multiparticles and entanglement can accelerate the quantum speed on observables in two-particle systems based on ultrahigh precision control of quantum evolution time. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that the initial quantum state plays a critical role in the quantum speed limits of the entangled systems. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that the upper bound and lower bound of the quantum speed are workable even in a nonunitary Markovian open system with two photons. The results obtained based on two-photon experiments have been shown to be generalizable to more particles. Our work facilitates the characterization of the dynamic transient properties of complex quantum systems and the control of the quantum speed of large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Colorimetry and Tribology of Ultrapure Copper Surface Micromodification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling optical and tribological properties of metal surfaces, like color and wear rate, without altering their chemical composition is a highly desirable process across numerous fields of science and industry. It represents a cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical methods, particularly for copper, one of the most important metals widely used where high electrical and thermal conductivity, alongside resistance to corrosion, are required. We investigated the control of copper surface texture through a controlled micromodification process, utilizing constant force and velocity with abrasive silicon carbide sandpaper on ultrapure copper pellets exhibiting elongated crystallographic grains, and its impact on optical properties. Systematically varying grit size and rubbing direction, both along and across the grains, resulted in tunable microgroove morphology, demonstrating a marked difference in wear rate between single-grain and multi-grain abrasion. Furthermore, modification along copper grain boundaries yielded a change in the wear rate by a factor of two, related to single-grain and multi-grain abrasion regime changes, enabling precise control over material performance via tuned abrasion conditions. Colorimetric analysis via C-Microscopy revealed a strong, statistically significant relationship between abrasive parameters, microgroove geometry (inclination angle, depth, and size), and optical spectral signatures, which were then parametrized to achieve targeted control. This research demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to color and reflectance modification via microgroove engineering, offering a pathway to customized material properties by uniquely coupling contact mechanics, surface morphology, and colorimetry at the microscale level.</description>

Abstract: We present a universal deep-learning method that reconstructs super-resolved images of quantum emitters from a single camera frame measurement. Trained on physics-based synthetic data spanning diverse point-spread functions, aberrations, and noise, the network generalizes across experimental conditions without system-specific retraining. We validate the approach on low- and high-density In(Ga)As quantum dots and strain-induced dots in 2D monolayer WSe$_2$, resolving overlapping emitters even under low signal-to-noise and inhomogeneous backgrounds. By eliminating calibration and iterative acquisitions, this single-shot strategy enables rapid, robust super-resolution for nanoscale characterization and quantum photonic device fabrication.</description>

      <title>Optimised spectral purity of unfiltered photons via pump and nonlinearity shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies rely on the efficient generation and interference of indistinguishable photons. Exceptional achievements in this respect have been obtained by domain engineering of quasi-phase-matched parametric down-conversion sources, demonstrating high two-photon interference visibility using only moderate bandpass spectral filtering. Here, we optimised the spectral purity and indistinguishability of photons from telecom-wavelength sources by combining Gaussian quasi-phase-matching with Gaussian pump spectral shaping. Without spectral filtering, we used time-of-flight spectrometry to estimate an upper bound spectral purity of 99.9272(6)%, and achieved visibilities of up to 98.5(8)% in two-photon interference experiments with independent sources.</description>

      <title>Passive harmonic mode-locked laser on lithium niobate integrated photonics</title>

Abstract: Mode-locked lasers (MLLs) are essential for a wide range of photonic applications, such as frequency metrology, biological imaging, and high-bandwidth coherent communications. The growing demand for compact and scalable photonic systems is driving the development of MLLs on various integrated photonics material platforms. Along these lines, developing MLLs on the emerging thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform holds the promise to greatly broaden the application space of MLLs by harnessing TFLN 's unique electro-optic (E-O) response and quadratic optical nonlinearity. Here, we demonstrate the first electrically pumped, self-starting passive MLL in lithium niobate integrated photonics based on its hybrid integration with a GaAs quantum-well gain medium and saturable absorber. Our demonstrated MLL generates 4.3-ps optical pulses centered around 1060 nm with on-chip peak power exceeding 44 mW. The pulse duration can be further compressed to 1.75 ps via linear dispersion compensation. Remarkably, passive mode-locking occurs exclusively at the second harmonic of the cavity free spectral range, exhibiting a high pulse repetition rate $\sim$20 GHz. We elucidate the temporal dynamics underlying this self-starting passive harmonic mode-locking behavior using a traveling-wave model. Our work offers new insights into the realization of compact, high-repetition-rate MLLs in the TFLN platform, with promising applications for monolithic ultrafast microwave waveform sampling and analog-to-digital conversion.</description>

      <title>Tamm Plasmon-Enhanced Widely Tunable Near-Infrared Nanolaser with Superior Efficiency and Output Power</title>

Abstract: Plasmonic resonances attract significant interest due to their ability to tightly confine electromagnetic fields. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and localized surface plasmons (LSPs) are widely used in plasmonic nanolasers, but performance is often affected by coupling into reflective and transmissive directions and multiple far-field modes, mainly due to higher-order diffraction from the plasmonic crystal. Here, we utilize the Tamm plasmon mode at the interface between a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and a metal layer to achieve lasing in the NIR region with wide tunability. Optical Tamm states are excited at the metal-DBR interface by a pump pulse, and emission is enhanced via extraordinary optical transmission through a metallic nanohole array, which suppresses higher-order diffraction and ensures a directional far-field pattern. A second DBR beneath the pump side further suppresses backward emission and enhances forward lasing intensity. The combination of Tamm plasmon excitation and dual-DBR feedback improves cavity response and overall lasing efficiency. This approach provides a cost-effective and versatile route to plasmonic nanolasers with enhanced efficiency, tunability, and integration potential for next-generation on-chip photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some new foundations of a theory of how observable macroscopic fields are related to spatial averages of their microscopic counterparts.
  I find that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts, meaning that the $\vec{P}$ and ${\vec{D}}$ fields do not appear in them. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
  I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density vanishes in a material's bulk. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic $\vec{E}$ field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable. I also show that most `quantum mechanical' aspects of the existing microscopic theory of electricity in materials are compatible with, or required features of, a statistical theory of classical particles whose charges and masses are comparable to those of electrons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of Multi-Level Atoms embedded in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole-Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within photonic crystals. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when the interatomic distance is comparable to the localization length of photon-atom bound states lying in the bandgap region. For atoms with anti-parallel dipole orientations, both initially entangled and separable states exhibit robust entanglement preservation due to strong collective interactions. Conversely, when dipoles are oriented orthogonally, initially entangled states exhibit unique oscillatory patterns in their entanglement dynamics. This effect arises from the formation of dark states due to destructive interference within the structured photonic environment, with resonant dipole-dipole interactions sustaining non-Markovian dynamics. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes. Our analysis establishes resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference as potential tools for tailoring entanglement dynamics, paving the way for controlled quantum coherence in photonic crystal platforms.</description>

Abstract: Time delays in photoemission are on the order of attoseconds and have been experimentally determined in atoms, molecules and solids. Their magnitude and energy dependence are expected to yield fundamental insights into the properties of the systems in which they're measured. In a recent study Biswas \textsl{et al.} (Biswas, S., F\"org, B., Ortmann, L. et al. Probing molecular environment through photoemission delays. Nat. Phys. 16, 778-783 (2020)) determined the absolute photoemission time of the I$4d$ level in iodoethane via attosecond streaking spectroscopy, finding the presence of a functional group to increase the photoemission time delay, suggesting a correlation between the size of the functional group and time delay based on a semi-classical calculation. Here we experimentally study the dependence of the I$4d$ photoemission time on the functional group in the iodoalkanes from iodomethane up to 2-iodobutane at three photon energies across the giant resonance in the I$4d\to\varepsilon f$ photoemission channel, finding that the presence alone of a functional group does not necessarily increase the photoemission delay, and that overall no clear correlation between its size and the photoemission time delay can be established.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Temperature induced optical scatter changes in titania-germania coatings</title>

Abstract: Titania doped with tantala is the high index material (high n) for the optical coatings used in LIGO and Virgo and its thermal noise limits LIGO/Virgo observations of astrophysical sources. In this paper, we study temperature induced changes to optical scatter of a multilayer highly reflective coating comprised of silica (low n) and titania doped with germania (high n) as a potential candidate to reduce coating thermal noise in ground-based observatories operating at room temperature. We observe that the scatter measured at 8 degree in a small region is low, with a median starting BRDF of $1.1 \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1}$ increasing to $1.2 \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1}$ through annealing. The results presented here show the potential of adopting titania doped with germania coatings for future upgrades to LIGO and Virgo and as a pathfinder coating for Cosmic Explorer, a next-generation detector.</description>
