      <title>Normal Holonomy of Complex Hyperbolic Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the restricted normal holonomy group of a K\"ahler submanifold of the complex hyperbolic space $\mathbb{C}H^{n}$ is always transitive, provided the index of relative nullity is zero. This contrasts with the case of $\mathbb{C}P^{n}$, where a Berger type result was proved by Console, Di Scala, and the second author. The proof is based on lifting the submanifold to the pseudo-Riemannian space $\mathbb{C}^{n,1}$ and developing new tools to handle the difficulties arising from possible degeneracies in holonomy tubes and associated distributions. In particular, we introduce the notion of weakly polar actions and a framework for dealing with degenerate submanifolds. These techniques could contribute to a broader understanding of submanifold geometry in spaces with indefinite signature, offering new insight into submanifolds in the dual setting of complex projective geometry.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ricci solitons and Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the long-time behavior of Ricci flows that collapse with bounded curvature, we study expanding Ricci solitons with nilpotent symmetry on vector bundles over a closed manifold. We prove that, under mild assumptions that are satisfied by Ricci flow limits, the equations dimension-reduce to the so-called twisted harmonic-Einstein equations. When the base is a surface, we establish a correspondence between solutions of the latter and a class of G-Higgs bundles. This allows us to produce infinite families of new examples that are not locally homogeneous, and in particular to obtain a complete description in dimension 4. We also show that all our examples admit Einstein one-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>From Adler-Gelfand-Dickey Brackets to Logarithmic Dubrovin-Frobenius manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new local Poisson bracket compatible with the second unconstrained Adler-Gelfand-Dickey bracket. The resulting bihamiltonian structure admits a dispersionless limit and the leading term defines a logarithmic Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold. Furthermore, we show that this Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold can be constructed on the orbits space of the standard representation of the permutation group.</description>

      <title>Small eigenvalues of the Hodge-Laplacian with sectional curvature bounded below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each degree p and each natural number k $\ge$ 1, we construct a oneparameter family of Riemannian metrics on any oriented closed manifold with volume one and the sectional curvature bounded below such that the k-th positive eigenvalue of the Hodge-Laplacian acting on differential p-forms converges to zero. This result imposes a constraint on the sectional curvature for our previous result in [AT24].</description>

      <title>Extension Research of Principal Bundle Constraint System Theory on Ricci-flat K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the geometric mechanics theory of constraint systems on principal bundles from the flat connection case to the general situation with non-zero curvature. Based on the theoretical foundation of compatible pairs under strong transversality conditions and principal bundle constraint systems, we systematically study the behavior of compatible pair theory in non-flat geometry within the context of Ricci-flat K\"ahler manifolds. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that the fundamental framework of strong transversality conditions and compatible pairs possesses universality and does not depend on the flatness assumption of connections. Furthermore, we re-derive the dynamical connection equations incorporating curvature reaction terms and extend Spencer cohomology theory to a spectral sequence structure capable of precisely encoding curvature information. The research reveals the exact action mechanism of curvature $\Omega$: it plays a crucial role through the integrability condition $\text{ad}_\Omega^* \lambda = 0$ and higher-order differentials in Spencer cohomology, while maintaining the fundamental structure of the theoretical framework unchanged. This extension not only deepens the geometric coupling theory between constraint systems and gauge fields but also provides new mathematical tools for modern gauge field theory, string theory geometry, and related topological analysis, demonstrating the profound connections between constraint geometry and classical differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Complex harmonic maps and rank 2 higher Teichm\"uller theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate and develop the theory of complex harmonic maps to holomorphic Riemannian symmetric spaces, which we make use of to study complex analytic aspects of higher Teichm\"uller theory, with a focus on rank $2$ Hitchin components.
  Complex harmonic maps lead to various generalizations of objects from the theory of Higgs bundles; for instance, the Hitchin fibration, cyclic Higgs bundles, and the affine Toda equations. Beyond such generalizations, we also find a relation between complex harmonic maps and opers.
  Within the realm of higher Teichm\"uller theory, for any rank $2$ Hitchin component, we prove a Bers-type theorem, which extends and improves our previous work on $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb R)$, and we prove that Goldman's symplectic form is compatible with Labourie's complex structure, so that the two determine a mapping class group invariant pseudo-K\"ahler structure. We obtain partial generalizations in higher rank, and we construct K\"ahler structures on other spaces that are related to the Hitchin components.</description>

      <title>The Volume-Renormalized Mass from a Hamiltonian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the volume-renormalized mass for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds recently introduced by the authors can be deduced from a reduced Hamiltonian perspective. In order to do this, we first use Michel's formalism of mass invariants to extend the definition of the volume-renormalized mass to initial data sets.
  We consider spacetimes that are foliated by asymptotically Poincar\'e--Einstein Riemannian manifolds in the spirit of the Milne model of cosmology and reduce the ADM Hamiltonian to an unconstrained Hamiltonian system, analogous to the work of Fischer and Moncrief for spatially compact spacetimes. We find that the reduced Hamiltonian in this case recovers the volume-renormalized mass. We then analyze the first and second variation of the reduced Hamiltonian and demonstrate that it is non-increasing over the evolution and constant only for self-similar spacetimes.</description>

      <title>(CMC) 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds are natural and yet rather curious objects in hyperbolic geometry with interesting applications.
  Firstly, Bryant revealed surprising relations between (CMC) $1$-immersions of surfaces into $\mathbb H^3$ (Bryant surfaces) and (cousins) minimal immersions into $\mathbb E^3.$ In addition, the interest to (CMC) immersions of a surface $S$ (closed, orientable, with genus $\mathfrak{g} \geq2$) into hyperbolic 3-manifolds was motivated by Uhlenbeck in connection to irreducible representations of the fundamental group $\pi_{1}(S)$ into $PSL(2,\mathbb{C}).$ However a (CMC) 1-immersed compact surface is likely to develop singularities (punctures at finitely many points), and indeed in our analysis the prescribed value 1 of the mean curvature enters as a "critical" parameter.
  In fact, Huang-Lucia-Tarantello showed that (CMC) $c$-immersions of $S$ into hyperbolic 3-manifolds exist for $|c | &lt;1$ and are parametrized by elements of the tangent bundle of the Teichmueller space of $S.$ More importantly, (CMC) $1$-immersions are attained only as "limits" for $|c| \to 1^-$ . In general the passage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena captured in terms of the Kodaira map and its suitable extension respectively for genus $\mathfrak{g}=2$ and $\mathfrak{g}=3.$ Here we handle the case of surfaces of any genus. In Theorem , we are able to encompass the blow up situation in terms of an appropriate "orthogonality" condition. Subsequently, we can provide the existence and uniqueness of (CMC) 1-immersions under an appropriate "generic" condition, see Theorem 2.</description>

      <title>A survey on geometric frameworks for action-dependent classical field theories and their relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive overview of three recently developed geometric frameworks for the study of classical action-dependent field theories. Specifically, the three underlying geometric structures - namely, k-contact, k-cocontact, and multicontact - are first introduced, and then used to develop the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of the aforementioned theories. Finally, the relationship among these three types of structures is analyzed in the case of trivial bundles; as well as the comparison with other alternative definitions of multicontact structure presented in the literature.</description>

Abstract: This paper shows that the complex projective plane $\mathbb{P}^2$ can be realized as the underlying space for a closed hyperbolic $4$-orbifold. This is the first example of a closed hyperbolic $4$-orbifold whose underlying space is symplectic, which is related to the open question as to whether or not closed hyperbolic $4$-manifolds can admit symplectic structures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new global Hessian matrix estimate for heat-type equations on Riemannian manifolds using a Bismut-type Hessian formula. Our results feature fully explicit coefficients as well as delay / growth rate functions. These estimates yield two key applications: a novel backward weak Harnack inequality and a precise pointwise Hessian estimate for eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Uniform, localized asymptotics for sub-Riemannian heat kernels, their logarithmic derivatives, and associated diffusion bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.12888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the small-time asymptotics of the sub-Riemannian heat kernel, its derivatives, and its logarithmic derivatives can be localized, allowing them to be studied even on incomplete manifolds, under essentially optimal conditions on the distance to infinity. Continuing, away from abnormal minimizers, we show that the asymptotics are closely connected to the structure of the minimizing geodesics between the two relevant points (which is non-trivial on the cut locus). This gives uniform heat kernel bounds on compacts, and also allows a complete expansion of the heat kernel, and its derivatives, in a wide variety of cases.
  The method extends naturally to logarithmic derivatives of the heat kernel, where we again get uniform bounds on compacts and a more precise expansion for any particular pair of points, in most cases. In particular, we determine the measure giving the law of large numbers for the corresponding diffusion bridge, and the leading terms of the logarithmic derivatives are given by the cumulants of geometrically natural random variables with respect to this measure. One consequence is that the non-abnormal cut locus is characterized by the behavior of the log-Hessian of the heat kernel.</description>

      <title>On Complex Lie Algebroids with Constant Real Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate a real distribution to any complex Lie algebroid that we call distribution of real elements and a new invariant that we call real rank, given by the pointwise rank of this distribution. When the real rank is constant, we obtain a real Lie algebroid inside the original complex Lie algebroid. Under another regularity condition, we associate a complex Lie subalgebroid that we call the minimal complex subalgebroid. We also provide a local splitting for complex Lie algebroids with constant real rank. In the last part, we introduce the complex matched pair of skew-algebroids; these pairs produce complex Lie algebroid structures on the complexification of a vector bundle. We use this operation to characterize all the complex Lie algebroid structures on the complexification of real vector bundles.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for the GSV-index of a foliation</title>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation at $p\in\mathbb{C}^2$, and $B$ be a separatrix of $\mathcal{F}$. We prove the following Dimca-Greuel type inequality $3\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)-4\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)+GSV_p(\mathcal{F},B)\leq 0$, where $\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the multiplicity of $\mathcal{F}$ along $B$, $\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the dimension of the quotient of $\mathbb{C}\{x,y\}$ by the ideal generated by the components of any $1$-form defining $\mathcal{F}$ and any equation of $B$, and $GSV_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the \textit{G\'omez-Mont-Seade-Verjovsky index} of the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $B$. As a consequence, we provide a new proof of the $\frac{4}{3}$-Dimca-Greuel conjecture for singularities of irreducible plane curve germs, with foliations ingredients, that differs from those given by Alberich-Carrami\~nana, Almir\'on, Blanco, Melle-Hern\'andez and Genzmer-Hernandes, but it is in line with the idea developed by Wang.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Misner space, incorporating Kip Thorne's "moving wall" model, and pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, exploring their geometric structures, geodesics, and causal properties. We propose that pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime serves as a non-flat generalization of Misner space. We then introduce the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, a novel chronology-violating model that extends the previous two frameworks and unifies the geodesic structures of all three spacetimes. We suggest that these spacetimes constitute a causality-violating family, interconnected through common fundamental causal features$-$geodesics, Cauchy and chronology horizons, and acausal regions$-$leading a conjecture that they are isocausal.</description>
