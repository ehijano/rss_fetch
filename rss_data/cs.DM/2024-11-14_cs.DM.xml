      <title>On sampling two spin models using the local connective constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes novel, optimum mixing bounds for the Glauber dynamics on the Hard-core and Ising models using the powerful Spectral Independence method from [Anari, Liu, Oveis-Gharan: FOCS 2020]. These bounds are expressed in terms of the local connective constant of the underlying graph $G$. This is a notion of effective degree of $G$ on a local scale.
  Our results have some interesting consequences for bounded degree graphs:
  (a) They include the max-degree bounds as a special case,
  (b) They improve on the running time of the FPTAS considered in [Sinclair, Srivastava, Stefankonic and Yin: PTRF 2017],
  (c) They allow us to obtain mixing bounds in terms of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix and improve on results in [Hayes: FOCS 2006],
  (d) They also allow us to refine the celebrated connection between the hardness of approximate counting and the phase transitions from statistical physics.
  We obtain our mixing bounds by utilising the $k$-non-backtracking matrix $H_{G,k}$. This is a very interesting, alas technically intricate, object to work with. We upper bound the spectral radius of the pairwise influence matrix $I^{\Lambda,\tau}_{G}$ by means of the 2-norm of $H_{G,k}$. To our knowledge, obtaining mixing bound using $H_{G,k}$ has not been considered before in the literature.</description>

      <title>Improved Constructions of Skew-Tolerant Gray Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study skew-tolerant Gray codes, which are Gray codes in which changes in consecutive codewords occur in adjacent positions. We present the first construction of asymptotically non-vanishing skew-tolerant Gray codes, offering an exponential improvement over the known construction. We also provide linear-time encoding and decoding algorithms for our codes. Finally, we extend the definition to non-binary alphabets, and provide constructions of complete $m$-ary skew-tolerant Gray codes for every base $m\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Long induced paths in sparse graphs and graphs with forbidden patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a graph $G$ with a path $P$ of order $n$. What conditions force $G$ to also have a long induced path? As complete bipartite graphs have long paths but no long induced paths, a natural restriction is to forbid some fixed complete bipartite graph $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph. In this case we show that $G$ has an induced path of order $(\log \log n)^{1/5-o(1)}$. This is an exponential improvement over a result of Galvin, Rival, and Sands (1982) and comes close to a recent upper bound of order $O((\log \log n)^2)$.
  Another way to approach this problem is by viewing $G$ as an ordered graph (where the vertices are ordered according to their position on the path $P$). From this point of view it is most natural to consider which ordered subgraphs need to be forbidden in order to force the existence of a long induced path. Focusing on the exclusion of ordered matchings, we improve or recover a number of existing results with much simpler proofs, in a unified way. We also show that if some forbidden ordered subgraph forces the existence of a long induced path in $G$, then this induced path has size at least $\Omega((\log \log \log n)^{1/3})$, and can be chosen to be increasing with respect to $P$.</description>

      <title>Sparser Abelian High Dimensional Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two new explicit constructions of Cayley high dimensional expanders (HDXs) over the abelian group $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. Our expansion proofs use only linear algebra and combinatorial arguments.
  The first construction gives local spectral HDXs of any constant dimension and subpolynomial degree $\exp(n^\epsilon)$ for every $\epsilon &gt;0$, improving on a construction by Golowich [Gol23] which achieves $\epsilon =1/2$. [Gol23] derives these HDXs by sparsifying the complete Grassmann poset of subspaces. The novelty in our construction is the ability to sparsify any expanding Grassmannian posets, leading to iterated sparsification and much smaller degrees. The sparse Grassmannian (which is of independent interest in the theory of HDXs) serves as the generating set of the Cayley graph.
  Our second construction gives a 2-dimensional HDXs of any polynomial degree $\exp(\epsilon n$) for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, which is simultaneously a spectral expander and a coboundary expander. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such non-trivial construction. We name it the Johnson complex, as it is derived from the classical Johnson scheme, whose vertices serve as the generating set of this Cayley graph. This construction may be viewed as a derandomization of the recent random geometric complexes of [LMSY23]. Establishing coboundary expansion through Gromov's "cone method" and the associated isoperimetric inequalities is the most intricate aspect of this construction.
  While these two constructions are quite different, we show that they both share a common structure, resembling the intersection patterns of vectors in the Hadamard code. We propose a general framework of such "Hadamard-like" constructions in the hope that it will yield new HDXs.</description>

      <title>Some Results on Digital Segments and Balanced Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit combinatorial results on Christoffel words and binary balanced words that are motivated by their geometric interpretation as approximations of digital segments. We give a closed formula for counting the exact number of balanced words with $a$ zeroes and $b$ ones. We also study minimal non-balanced words.</description>
