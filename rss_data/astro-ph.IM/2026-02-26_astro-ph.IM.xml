      <title>A Path to an All-Sky Survey with Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep, space-based, all-sky near-infrared survey carried out with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would constitute a foundational astronomical infrastructure for decades to come. In this white paper, we present a concrete and feasible path to imaging the entire sky at $\sim0.1''$ resolution, beginning with high-impact fields in Cycle 1 and scaling to ultra-wide coverage within the nominal mission. This first-epoch survey will reach $\mathrm{H}\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$\sigma$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science. We invite broad community participation in shaping and carrying out both the initial program and the long-term vision of an all-sky Roman survey.</description>

      <title>Conditional Image Diffusion with Interferometric Closure Invariants: Independent EHT Imaging of Centaurus~A and 3C~279</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present independent imaging analyses of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the active galactic nuclei in radio galaxy Centaurus~A and quasar 3C~279 using Generative Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (GenDIReCT), a recently developed machine-learning framework built on conditional diffusion models that uses interferometric closure invariants as primary observables. For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\simeq 80\,\mu$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\pm 1.0\,\mu$as over $\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\simeq 10\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments.</description>

      <title>pythonradex: a fast Python re-implementation of RADEX with extended functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common task in astronomical research is to estimate the physical parameters (temperature, mass, density etc.) of a gas by using observed line emission. This often requires a calculation of how the radiation propagates via emission and absorption (so-called radiative transfer). In radio and infrared astronomy, the Fortran code RADEX (van der Tak et al., 2007) is a popular tool to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer of a uniform medium in a simplified geometry. I present pythonradex, a Python re-implementation of RADEX. Written in Python, it provides an easy and intuitive user interface, improved performance as well as additional functionality not included in RADEX, such as continuum effects and overlapping lines. In addition, pythonradex provides a self-consistent computation of the total flux for all geometries, including spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>Electrical coupling of a horizontal dipole antenna to a dielectric half-space: applications to radio astronomy from the lunar surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The far side of the Moon, shielded from terrestrial radio frequency interference and beyond the influence of Earth's ionosphere, should offer a uniquely quiet environment for radio astronomy and cosmological experiments. The radio sky below 30 MHz is largely unexplored and is thought to contain spectral signatures of new physics in the early, high-redshift Universe. Achieving precision measurements in this band requires accurate understanding of antenna performance and systematics. For upcoming lunar surface radio astronomy missions, this modeling will be challenging because antennas will deploy at heights that are only a small fraction of a wavelength above the lunar regolith, where strong coupling between the antenna and the surface can significantly alter impedance, radiation patterns, and efficiency. The challenge is compounded by the layered dielectric structure of the regolith and the tendency for permittivity to increase with depth, both of which are difficult to represent faithfully in numerical simulations.
  In this work, we review theoretical predictions for the behavior of a simple horizontal dipole above a dielectric half-space, representing the lunar regolith, and compare them with simulation results obtained using the Ansys HFSS integral equation solver. We quantify how the antenna impedance and beam pattern couple to the sky for a representative lunar surface radio astronomy experiment. The results show that surface induced effects decrease rapidly, even for modest increases in antenna height above the regolith. Conversely, a dipole antenna placed on or very near the lunar surface will exhibit complex spectral response that renders systematics control very difficult without detailed information on regolith properties.</description>

      <title>Beam tube boundary effects in stray light modeling of long Fabry-Perot arm cavities for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope will operate 10-40 km Fabry-Perot arm cavities inside vacuum beam tubes. FFT-based paraxial tools treat propagation in free space and therefore do not explicitly enforce beam tube boundary conditions. We introduce a waveguide-like mode description of the optical field that incorporates an imposed beam tube boundary condition and enables an independent benchmark of free-space FFT tools We derive the associated modal-mixing matrices for mirrors and baffles, including a closed-form series for axisymmetric circular apertures. We quantify the strain-equivalent couplings from baffle miscentering and from a localized near-wall tube defect, and show that they are suppressed as baffle density increases. In the relevant regime of densely baffled cavities and small perturbations, beam tube boundary effects are subdominant, which supports the continued use of FFT-based codes to guide the design of 3G detectors.</description>

      <title>Probing Large-scale Structure and the Multi-Phase IGM at the Cosmic Noon -- Insights from a Joint Survey with Euclid, CSST, JPCam, and JUST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present scientific and technical justifications of a potential coordinated Euclid/CSST/JPCam/JUST survey of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N), aimed at probing the multi-phase circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM) at the cosmic noon over ~20 deg$^2$. The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the absorbed atomic Universe with the [OI]63um line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of strongly absorbed [OI]63um in a sample of 12 DSFGs at 4.2&lt;z&lt;5.8 selected from the SPT survey. This is the first systematic survey of the [OI]63um fine-structure line at z&gt;4. Using ALMA Bands 9 and 10, we obtain spatially and spectrally resolved observations that probe the interstellar medium on sub-kpc scales. Despite reaching sensitivities 10-100x deeper than most previous studies, we detect [OI]63um in emission in only 2 sources at low significance, with the remaining galaxies yielding stringent non-detections over the full velocity range covered by robust detections of other far-infrared lines, including [CII] and [NII]205um. We identify several compact (0.05-0.2") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission "escape channels" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF. X. A Novel Method for Measuring Integrated Galaxy Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the drizzling pipeline and contents of the drizzled database for Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 27-29 Archival Legacy project "SKYSURF," the largest archival project ever approved for Hubble. SKYSURF aims to investigate the extragalactic background light using all 143,914 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR images that have been taken by Hubble since its launch in 2002. SKYSURF has produced 38,027 single-visit mosaics and 7,893 multi-visit mosaics across 28 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR filters using nonstandard drizzling methods, which include preserving the lowest sky-level of each visit/group in the drizzled products, applying wider apertures for cosmic-ray rejection, correcting effects caused by charge transfer efficiency degradation, and removing potential light gradients from input images via sky-map subtraction. We generate source catalogs for all drizzled products with SExtractor and provide updated star-galaxy separation parameters and integrated galaxy light (IGL) estimates for 25 of the 28 SKYSURF filters (wavelength range 0.2-1.7 um) using a novel IGL fitting method made possible by the vast SKYSURF dataset. We discuss the data processing and data analysis challenges encountered, detail our solutions, and offer suggestions that may facilitate future large-scale IGL investigations with Webb, SPHEREx, and Roman.</description>

      <title>QUIJOTE-TFGI polarization calibration -- Ground characterization and on-sky validation with Tau A and the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our objective is to characterize the QUIJOTE Thirty and Forty GHz instrument (TFGI), calibrate it with a reference calibration signal on the ground, compare our results with on-sky calibration based on bright sources, and study the stability of the calibration parameters over time. First, from the ground, we fit the data using a reference calibration signal (a diode) introduced to resolve degeneracies among the various instrument angles. Finally, we utilize on-sky observations of Tau A and the Moon to validate the results. By creating calibration datasets obtained with the reference diode, we evaluate the data quality and quantify phase switch errors to account for the fine polarization response. We also utilize Tau A and Moon observations to calibrate the system's response and stability over time. In addition, we calculate the refraction index of the Moon to be $n_{Moon}$ = 1.209 $\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\pm$ 0.005 (sys) at 31 GHz under smooth-surface assumption. The results from fitting the instrument phase-switch error angle align with 0 deg at 2$\sigma$ precision, indicating that no further correction is required within a few percent precision. The calibrations with astrophysical sources (Tau A and the Moon) yield consistent results that constrain the polarization angle and responsivity. The polarization efficiency aligns well with ground measurements and the Tau A characterization, whereas the Moon-based calibration is more affected by systematics. We find hints of responsivity variations over time, although the relative responsivity between channels is found to remain stable. In the future, we conclude that installing a live calibrator will enhance performance by continuously monitoring responsivity and, in turn, improving the mitigation of systematic effects.</description>

      <title>The HyLight model for hydrogen emission lines in simulated nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen recombination lines provide key diagnostics of ionized gas in galaxies, yet most hydrodynamical simulations estimate hydrogen level populations using interpolated emissivity tables rather than computing them directly from local physical conditions. We present HyLight, a Python-based atomic model that calculates hydrogen level populations and line emissivities from the gas density, temperature, and ionization state, enabling accurate predictions in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium environments. Benchmark comparisons show that HyLight reproduces Cloudy predictions for Balmer, Paschen, and Brackett emissivities to within 1 per cent under typical photoionized nebular conditions, while discrepancies of several tens of per cent arise relative to other published calculations. As an illustrative application, we use HyLight to compute photoionization-to-line intensity ratios in an HII nebula and generate synthetic hydrogen emission maps from a radiation-hydrodynamical simulation that includes non-equilibrium thermochemistry. Combining physical consistency with flexibility, HyLight provides a robust framework for connecting hydrodynamical simulations with observational diagnostics of photoionized regions, and enhances our ability to interpret hydrogen emission in complex, non-equilibrium astrophysical environments.</description>
