      <title>Spike Talk: Genesis and Neural Coding Scheme Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Characteristics in Queue Length Dynamics: Insights from Adaptive Signalized Corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-similarity, a fractal characteristic of traffic flow dynamics, is widely recognized in transportation engineering and physics. However, its practical application in real-world traffic scenarios remains limited. Conversely, the traffic flow dynamics at adaptive signalized intersections still need to be fully understood. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the queue length time series from an adaptive signalized corridor and characterizing its self-similarity. The findings uncover a $1/f$ structure in the power spectrum of queue lengths, indicative of self-similarity. Furthermore, the paper estimates local scaling exponents $(\alpha)$, a measure of self-similarity computed via detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and identifies a positive correlation with congestion patterns. Additionally, the study examines the fractal dynamics of queue length through the evolution of scaling exponent. As a result, the paper offers new insights into the queue length dynamics of signalized intersections, which might help better understand the impact of adaptivity within the system.</description>

      <title>Individual Identification Using Radar-Measured Respiratory and Heartbeat Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a method for radar-based identification of individuals using a combination of their respiratory and heartbeat features. In the proposed method, the target individual's respiratory features are extracted using the modified raised-cosine-waveform model and their heartbeat features are extracted using the mel-frequency cepstral analysis technique. To identify a suitable combination of features and a classifier, we compare the performances of nine methods based on various combinations of three feature vectors with three classifiers. The accuracy of the proposed method in performing individual identification is evaluated using a 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar system with an antenna array in two experimental scenarios and we demonstrate the importance of use of the combination of the respiratory and heartbeat features in achieving accurate identification of individuals. The proposed method achieves accuracy of 96.33% when applied to a five-day dataset of six participants and 99.39% when applied to a public one-day dataset of thirty participants.</description>

      <title>TransRx-6G-V2X : Transformer Encoder-Based Deep Neural Receiver For Next Generation of Cellular Vehicular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end wireless communication is new concept expected to be widely used in the physical layer of future wireless communication systems (6G). It involves the substitution of transmitter and receiver block components with a deep neural network (DNN), aiming to enhance the efficiency of data transmission. This will ensure the transition of autonomous vehicles (AVs) from self-autonomy to full collaborative autonomy, that requires vehicular connectivity with high data throughput and minimal latency. In this article, we propose a novel neural network receiver based on transformer architecture, named TransRx, designed for vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications. The TransRx system replaces conventional receiver block components in traditional communication setups. We evaluated our proposed system across various scenarios using different parameter sets and velocities ranging from 0 to 120 km/h over Urban Macro-cell (UMa) channels as defined by 3GPP. The results demonstrate that TransRx outperforms the state-of-the-art systems, achieving a 3.5dB improvement in convergence to low Bit Error Rate (BER) compared to convolutional neural network (CNN)-based neural receivers, and an 8dB improvement compared to traditional baseline receiver configurations. Furthermore, our proposed system exhibits robust generalization capabilities, making it suitable for deployment in large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>Rate Maximization for RIS-Assisted OAM Multiuser Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) technologies have encountered bottlenecks of significantly increasing spectrum efficiencies of wireless communications due to the low degrees of freedom in practical line-of-sight scenarios and severe path loss of high frequency carriers. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has shown the potential for high spectrum efficiencies in radio frequency domains. To investigate the advantage of OAM in multiuser communications, in this paper we propose the reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS) assisted OAM multiuser (MU) wireless communication schemes, where RIS is deployed to establish the direct links blocked by obstacles between the OAM transmitter and users, to significantly increase the achievable sum rate (ASR) of MU systems. To maximize the ASR, we develop the alternative optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit power and phase shifts of RIS. The numerical outcomes demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme compared to existing methods in terms of ASR.</description>

      <title>Generalized Reduced-WMMSE Approach for Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Per-AP Power Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of cooperative beamforming vectors in cell-free massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems is presented where multi-antenna access points (APs) support downlink data transmission of multiple users. Albeit the successes of the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) algorithm and their variants, they lack careful investigations about computational complexity that scales with the number of antennas and APs. We propose a generalized and reduced WMMSE (G-R-WMMSE) approach whose complexity is significantly lower than conventional WMMSE. We partition the set of beamforming coefficients into subvectors, with each subvector corresponding to a specific AP. Such a partitioning approach decomposes the original WMMSE problem across individual APs. By leveraging the Lagrange duality analysis, a closed-form solution can be derived for each subproblem, which substantially reduces the computation burden. Additionally, we present a parallel execution of the proposed G-R-WMMSE with adaptive step sizes, aiming at further reducing the time complexity. Numerical results validate that the proposed G-R-WMMSE schemes achieve over 99% complexity savings compared to the conventional WMMSE scheme while maintaining almost the same performance.</description>

      <title>CATD: Unified Representation Learning for EEG-to-fMRI Cross-Modal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal neuroimaging analysis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of brain function and pathology, as it allows for the integration of different imaging techniques, thus overcoming the limitations of individual modalities. However, the high costs and limited availability of certain modalities pose significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposed the Condition-Aligned Temporal Diffusion (CATD) framework for end-to-end cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging, enabling the generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-detected Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals from more accessible Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By constructing Conditionally Aligned Block (CAB), heterogeneous neuroimages are aligned into a potential space, achieving a unified representation that provides the foundation for cross-modal transformation in neuroimaging. The combination with the constructed Dynamic Time-Frequency Segmentation (DTFS) module also enables the use of EEG signals to improve the temporal resolution of BOLD signals, thus augmenting the capture of the dynamic details of the brain. Experimental validation demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework in improving the accuracy of neural activity prediction, identifying abnormal brain regions, and enhancing the temporal resolution of BOLD signals. The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging by unifying heterogeneous neuroimaging data into a potential representation space, showing promise in medical applications such as improving Parkinson's disease prediction and identifying abnormal brain regions.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the Potential of Adaptive LMS Filtering on FPGA-Based Qubit Control Platforms for Improved Qubit Readout in 2D and 3D Quantum Processing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum computing underscore the critical need for sophisticated qubit readout techniques to accurately discern quantum states. This abstract presents our research intended for optimizing readout pulse fidelity for 2D and 3D Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), the latter coupled with Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities. Focusing specifically on the application of the Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filtering algorithm, we explore its integration into the FPGA-based control systems to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of qubit state detection by improving Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Implementing the LMS algorithm on the Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC Gen 3 devices (RFSoC 4x2 FPGA and ZCU216 FPGA) using the Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK) open-source platform, we aim to dynamically test and adjust the filtering parameters in real-time to characterize and adapt to the noise profile presented in quantum computing readout signals. Our preliminary results demonstrate the LMS filter's capability to maintain high readout accuracy while efficiently managing FPGA resources. These findings are expected to contribute to developing more reliable and scalable quantum computing architectures, highlighting the pivotal role of adaptive signal processing in quantum technology advancements.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Near-Field Communications for Next-Generation Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-antenna technologies are advancing toward the development of extremely large aperture arrays and the utilization of extremely high frequencies, driving the progress of next-generation multiple access (NGMA). This evolution is accompanied by the emergence of near-field communications (NFC), characterized by spherical-wave propagation, which introduces additional range dimensions to the channel and enhances system throughput. In this context, a tutorial-based primer on NFC is presented, emphasizing its applications in multiuser communications and multiple access (MA). The following areas are investigated: \romannumeral1) the commonly used near-field channel models are reviewed along with their simplifications under various near-field conditions. \romannumeral2) Building upon these models, the information-theoretic capacity limits of NFC-MA are analyzed, including the derivation of sum-rate capacity and capacity region, and their upper limits for both downlink and uplink scenarios. \romannumeral3) A detailed investigation of near-field multiuser beamforming design is presented, offering low-complexity and effective NFC-MA design methodologies in both the spatial and wavenumber (angular) domains. Throughout these investigations, near-field MA is compared with its far-field counterpart to highlight its superiority and flexibility in terms of interference management, thereby laying the groundwork for achieving NGMA.</description>

      <title>Adaptive optical signal-to-noise ratio recovery for long-distance optical fiber transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In long-distance fiber optic transmission, the optic fiber link and erbium-doped fiber amplifiers can introduce excessive noise, which reduces the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). The narrow-band optical filters can be used to eliminate noise and thereby improve OSNR. However, there is a relative frequency drift between the signal and the narrow-band filter, which leads to filtered signal instability. This paper proposes an adaptive OSNR recovery scheme based on a Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity with mode width of 6 MHz. Utilizing the comb filtering of F-P cavity, the noise around the carrier and sidebands of the signal is filtered out simultaneously. To avoid frequency mismatch, we propose a double-servo scheme to suppress relative frequency drift between the signal and the F-P cavity. We constructed a stable radio frequency transfer system based on passive phase compensation and compared our scheme with other OSNR recovery schemes based on optical filters. Compared to the schemes based on dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and Waveshaper, our scheme demonstrates an improvement in OSNR of carrier by at least 12 dB and sidebands by at least 23.5 dB. The short-term transfer stability (1 s) is improved by one order of magnitude compared to DWDM and half an order of magnitude compared to Waveshper. This scheme can be applied to the recovery of signals with low OSNR in long-distance fiber optic transmission, improving signal quaility and extending the transmission distance limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.13894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse manifold learning algorithms combine techniques in manifold learning and sparse optimization to learn features that could be utilized for downstream tasks. The standard setting of compressive sensing can not be immediately applied to this setup. Due to the intrinsic geometric structure of data, dictionary atoms might be redundant and do not satisfy the restricted isometry property or coherence condition. In addition, manifold learning emphasizes learning local geometry which is not reflected in a standard $\ell_1$ minimization problem. We propose weighted $\ell_0$ and weighted $\ell_1$ metrics that encourage representation via neighborhood atoms suited for dictionary based manifold learning. Assuming that the data is generated from Delaunay triangulation, we show the equivalence of weighted $\ell_0$ and weighted $\ell_1$. We discuss an optimization program that learns the dictionaries and sparse coefficients and demonstrate the utility of our regularization on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an objective tool for emotion recognition with promising applications. However, the scarcity of labeled data remains a major challenge in this field, limiting the widespread use of EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, a semi-supervised Dual-stream Self-Attentive Adversarial Graph Contrastive learning framework (termed as DS-AGC) is proposed to tackle the challenge of limited labeled data in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition. The DS-AGC framework includes two parallel streams for extracting non-structural and structural EEG features. The non-structural stream incorporates a semi-supervised multi-domain adaptation method to alleviate distribution discrepancy among labeled source domain, unlabeled source domain, and unknown target domain. The structural stream develops a graph contrastive learning method to extract effective graph-based feature representation from multiple EEG channels in a semi-supervised manner. Further, a self-attentive fusion module is developed for feature fusion, sample selection, and emotion recognition, which highlights EEG features more relevant to emotions and data samples in the labeled source domain that are closer to the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) using a semi-supervised cross-subject leave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluation scheme show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods under different incomplete label conditions (with an average improvement of 5.83% on SEED and 6.99% on SEED-IV), demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the label scarcity problem in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Fair Computation Offloading for RSMA-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) provides a flexible transmission framework that can be applied in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. However, the research work on RSMA-assisted MEC systems is still at the infancy and many design issues remain unsolved, such as the MEC server and channel allocation problem in general multi-server and multi-channel scenarios as well as the user fairness issues. In this regard, we study an RSMA-assisted MEC system with multiple MEC servers, channels and devices, and consider the fairness among devices. A max-min fairness computation offloading problem to maximize the minimum computation offloading rate is investigated. Since the problem is difficult to solve optimally, we develop an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. Particularly, the time allocation and the computing frequency allocation are derived as closed-form functions of the transmit power allocation and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order, while the transmit power allocation and the SIC decoding order are jointly optimized via the alternating optimization method, the bisection search method and the successive convex approximation method. For the channel and MEC server allocation problem, we transform it into a hypergraph matching problem and solve it by matching theory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA-assisted MEC system outperforms current MEC systems under various system setups.</description>

      <title>Leveraging PRS and PDSCH for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the industrial standpoint on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), the preference lies in augmenting existing infrastructure with sensing services while minimizing network changes and leveraging available resources. This paper investigates the potential of utilizing the existing infrastructure of fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) signals as defined by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), particularly focusing on pilot signals for sensing within the ISAC framework. We propose to take advantage of the existing positioning reference signal (PRS) for sensing and the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) for communication, both readily available in 5G NR. However, the use of PRS for sensing poses challenges, leading to the appearance of ghost targets.
  To overcome this obstacle, we propose two innovative approaches for different PRS comb sizes within the ISAC framework, leveraging the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) within PDSCH to eliminate ghost targets. Subsequently, we formulate a resource allocation problem between PRS and PDSCH and determine the Pareto optimal point between communication and sensing without ghost targets. Through comprehensive simulation and analysis, we demonstrate that the joint exploitation of DMRS and PRS offers a promising solution for ghost target removal, while effective time and frequency resource allocation enables the achievement of Pareto optimality in ISAC.</description>

      <title>Doppler Ambiguity Elimination Using 5G Signals in Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The industrial point of view towards integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), the preference is to leverage existing resources and fifth-generation (5G) infrastructure to minimize deployment costs and complexity. In this context, we explore the utilization of current 5G new radio (NR) signals aligned with 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards. Positioning reference signals (PRS) for sensing and physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) for communication have been chosen to form an ISAC framework. However, PRS-based sensing suffers from Doppler ambiguity when the Doppler frequency shift is severe. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method within the ISAC system that leverages the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) present in PDSCH to eliminate Doppler ambiguity. Furthermore, we formulate a resource allocation problem between PRS and PDSCH to achieve a Pareto optimal point between communication and sensing without Doppler ambiguity. Through simulations and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on joint DMRS-PRS exploitation in mitigating Doppler ambiguity and the efficiency of the resource allocation scheme in achieving Pareto optimality for ISAC within a 5G NR framework.</description>

      <title>Insights from the Design Space Exploration of Flow-Guided Nanoscale Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanodevices with Terahertz (THz)-based wireless communication capabilities are providing a primer for flow-guided localization within the human bloodstreams. Such localization is allowing for assigning the locations of sensed events with the events themselves, providing benefits along the lines of early and precise diagnostics, and reduced costs and invasiveness. Flow-guided localization is still in a rudimentary phase, with only a handful of works targeting the problem. Nonetheless, the performance assessments of the proposed solutions are already carried out in a non-standardized way, usually along a single performance metric, and ignoring various aspects that are relevant at such a scale (e.g., nanodevices' limited energy) and for such a challenging environment (e.g., extreme attenuation of in-body THz propagation). As such, these assessments feature low levels of realism and cannot be compared in an objective way. Toward addressing this issue, we account for the environmental and scale-related peculiarities of the scenario and assess the performance of two state-of-the-art flow-guided localization approaches along a set of heterogeneous performance metrics such as the accuracy and reliability of localization.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing with Rigorous Guarantees for Pooled Data and Quantitative Group Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items of each category within the pool. We study an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating the categories and rigorously characterize its performance, in both the noiseless and noisy settings. For the noiseless setting, we show that the AMP algorithm is equivalent to one recently proposed by El Alaoui et al. Our results provide a rigorous version of their performance guarantees, previously obtained via non-rigorous techniques. For the case of pooled data with two categories, known as quantitative group testing (QGT), we use the AMP guarantees to compute precise limiting values of the false positive rate and the false negative rate. Though the pooled data problem and QGT are both instances of estimation in a linear model, existing AMP theory cannot be directly applied since the design matrices are binary valued. The key technical ingredient in our analysis is a rigorous asymptotic characterization of AMP for generalized linear models defined via generalized white noise design matrices. This result, established using a recent universality result of Wang et al., is of independent interest. Our theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. For comparison, we propose estimators based on convex relaxation and iterative thresholding, without providing theoretical guarantees. The simulations indicate that AMP outperforms the convex estimator for noiseless pooled data and QGT, but the convex estimator performs slightly better for noisy pooled data with three categories when the number of observations is small.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Orbital Angular Momentum Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode multiplexing has the potential to achieve high spectrum-efficiency communications at the same time and frequency by using orthogonal mode resource. However, the vortex wave hollow divergence characteristic results in the requirement of the large-scale receive antenna, which makes users hardly receive the OAM signal by size-limited equipment. To promote the OAM application in the next 6G communications, this paper proposes the cooperative OAM wireless (COW) communication scheme, which can select the cooperative users (CUs) to form the aligned antennas by size-limited user equipment. First, we derive the feasible radial radius and selective waist radius to choose the CUs in the same circle with the origin at the base station. Then, based on the locations of CUs, the waist radius is adjusted to form the receive antennas and ensure the maximum intensity for the CUs. Finally, the cooperative formation probability is derived in the closed-form solution, which can depict the feasibility of the proposed COW communication scheme. Furthermore, OAM beam steering is used to expand the feasible CU region, thus achieving higher cooperative formation probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived cooperative formation probability in mathematical analysis is very close to the statistical probability of cooperative formation, and the proposed COW communication scheme can obtain higher spectrum efficiency than the traditional scheme due to the effective reception of the OAM signal.</description>

      <title>Precoding Based Downlink OAM-MIMO Communications with Rate Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) and rate splitting (RS) are the potential key techniques for the future wireless communications. As a new orthogonal resource, OAM can achieve the multifold increase of spectrum efficiency to relieve the scarcity of the spectrum resource, but how to enhance the privacy performance imposes crucial challenge for OAM communications. RS technique divides the information into private and common parts, which can guarantee the privacies for all users. In this paper, we integrate the RS technique into downlink OAM-MIMO communications, and study the precoding optimization to maximize the sum capacity. First, the concentric uniform circular arrays (UCAs) are utilized to construct the downlink transmission framework of OAM-MIMO communications with RS. Particularly, users in the same user pair utilize RS technique to obtain the information and different user pairs use different OAM modes. Then, we derive the OAM-MIMO channel model, and formulate the sum capacity maximization problem. Finally, based on the fractional programming, the optimal precoding matrix is obtained to maximize the sum capacity by using quadratic transformation. Extensive simulation results show that by using the proposed precoding optimization algorithm, OAM-MIMO communications with RS can achieve higher sum capacity than the traditional communication schemes.</description>

      <title>Air-to-Ground Cooperative OAM Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For users in hotspot region, orbital angular momentum (OAM) can realize multifold increase of spectrum efficiency (SE), and the flying base station (FBS) can rapidly support the real-time communication demand. However, the hollow divergence and alignment requirement impose crucial challenges for users to achieve air-to-ground OAM communications, where there exists the line-of-sight path. Therefore, we propose the air-to-ground cooperative OAM communication (ACOC) scheme, which can realize OAM communications for users with size-limited devices. The waist radius is adjusted to guarantee the maximum intensity at the cooperative users (CUs). We derive the closed-form expression of the optimal FBS position, which satisfies the antenna alignment for two cooperative user groups (CUGs). Furthermore, the selection constraint is given to choose two CUGs composed of four CUs. Simulation results are provided to validate the optimal FBS position and the SE superiority of the proposed ACOC scheme.</description>
