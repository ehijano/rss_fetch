      <title>GroupBeaMR: Analyzing Collaborative Group Behavior in Mixed Reality Through Passive Sensing and Sociometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding group behavior is essential for improving collaboration and productivity. While research on group behavior in virtual reality (VR) is significantly advanced, understanding group dynamics in mixed reality (MR) remains understudied. Understanding MR group dynamics will enable designing systems that optimize collaboration, enhance productivity, and improve user experiences. This work outlines how MR headsets sensory systems can effectively capture group behavior, devise algorithms to process and interpret the data and demonstrate the correlation between group behavior and task-related performance metrics. We propose a framework for group behavior analysis in MR, or GroupBeaMR for short, to capture and analyze group behavior in MR. Using the rich sensory capabilities of MR headsets, GroupBeaMR passively collects data on conversation, shared attention, and proximity. This data is processed using social network analysis techniques to identify patterns of interaction and assess group behavior. Our evaluation, involving 44 participants in 11 groups, demonstrates the effectiveness of GroupBeaMR in capturing and analyzing group behavior in collaborative MR tasks. An example of insight from GroupBeaMR is that balanced participation in different types of interaction leads to higher group cohesion. These findings enable real-time assessments of group behavior in MR that can enhance collaborative experiences.</description>

      <title>Tap into Reality: Understanding the Impact of Interactions on Presence and Reaction Time in Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing presence in mixed reality (MR) relies on precise measurement and quantification. While presence has traditionally been measured through subjective questionnaires, recent research links presence with objective metrics like reaction time. Past studies examined this correlation with varying technical factors (object realism and behavior) and human conditioning, but the impact of interaction remains unclear. To answer this question, we conducted a within-subjects study (N=50) to explore the correlation between presence and reaction time across two interaction scenarios (direct and symbolic) with two tasks (selection and manipulation). We found that presence scores and reaction times are correlated (correlation coefficient of $-0.54$), suggesting that the impact of interaction on reaction time correlates with its effect on presence.</description>

      <title>Reaction Time as a Proxy for Presence in Mixed Reality with Distraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distractions in mixed reality (MR) environments can significantly influence user experience, affecting key factors such as presence, reaction time, cognitive load, and Break in Presence (BIP). Presence measures immersion, reaction time captures user responsiveness, cognitive load reflects mental effort, and BIP represents moments when attention shifts from the virtual to the real world, breaking immersion. However, the effects of distractions on these elements remain insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we have presented a theoretical model to understand how congruent and incongruent distractions affect all these constructs. We conducted a within-subject study (N=54) where participants performed image-sorting tasks under different distraction conditions. Our findings show that incongruent distractions significantly increase cognitive load, slow reaction times, and elevate BIP frequency, with presence mediating these effects.</description>

      <title>TraDE: Network and Traffic-aware Adaptive Scheduling for Microservices Under Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic architecture to microservices has enhanced flexibility in application design and its scalable execution. This approach often involves using a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform, which supports the deployment of microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we introduce a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE. This framework can adaptively redeploy microservice containers to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3\%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.4x while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36\% and showing robust adaptive capability under sustained workloads.</description>

      <title>From Resource Control to Digital Trust with User-Managed Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The User-Managed Access (UMA) extension to OAuth 2.0 is a promising candidate for increasing Digital Trust in personal data ecosystems like Solid. With minor modifications, it can achieve many requirements regarding usage control and transaction contextualization, even though additional specification is needed to address delegation of control and retraction of usage policies.</description>

      <title>An ambient denoising method based on multi-channel non-negative matrix factorization for wheezing detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a parallel computing method is proposed to perform the background denoising and wheezing detection from a multi-channel recording captured during the auscultation process. The proposed system is based on a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach and a detection strategy. Moreover, the initialization of the proposed model is based on singular value decomposition to avoid dependence on the initial values of the NMF parameters. Additionally, novel update rules to simultaneously address the multichannel denoising while preserving an orthogonal constraint to maximize source separation have been designed. The proposed system has been evaluated for the task of wheezing detection showing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms when noisy sound sources are present. Moreover, parallel and high-performance techniques have been used to speedup the execution of the proposed system, showing that it is possible to achieve fast execution times, which enables its implementation in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>StoX-Net: Stochastic Processing of Partial Sums for Efficient In-Memory Computing DNN Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossbar-based in-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising platform for hardware acceleration of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the energy and latency of IMC systems are dominated by the large overhead of the peripheral analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To address such ADC bottleneck, here we propose to implement stochastic processing of array-level partial sums (PS) for efficient IMC. Leveraging the probabilistic switching of spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junctions, the proposed PS processing eliminates the costly ADC, achieving significant improvement in energy and area efficiency. To mitigate accuracy loss, we develop PS-quantization-aware training that enables backward propagation across stochastic PS. Furthermore, a novel scheme with an inhomogeneous sampling length of the stochastic conversion is proposed. When running ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our architecture-to-algorithm co-design demonstrates up to 16x, 8x, and 10x improvement in energy, latency, and area, respectively, compared to IMC with standard ADC. Our optimized design configuration using stochastic PS achieved 130x (24x) improvement in Energy-Delay-Product compared to IMC with full precision ADC (sparse low-bit ADC), while maintaining near-software accuracy at various benchmark classification tasks.</description>
