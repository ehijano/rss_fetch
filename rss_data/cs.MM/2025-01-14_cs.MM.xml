      <title>Fitting Different Interactive Information: Joint Classification of Emotion and Intention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first-place solution for ICASSP MEIJU@2025 Track I, which focuses on low-resource multimodal emotion and intention recognition. How to effectively utilize a large amount of unlabeled data, while ensuring the mutual promotion of different difficulty levels tasks in the interaction stage, these two points become the key to the competition. In this paper, pseudo-label labeling is carried out on the model trained with labeled data, and samples with high confidence and their labels are selected to alleviate the problem of low resources. At the same time, the characteristic of easy represented ability of intention recognition found in the experiment is used to make mutually promote with emotion recognition under different attention heads, and higher performance of intention recognition is achieved through fusion. Finally, under the refined processing data, we achieve the score of 0.5532 in the Test set, and win the championship of the track.</description>

      <title>NVS-SQA: Exploring Self-Supervised Quality Representation Learning for Neurally Synthesized Scenes without References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural View Synthesis (NVS), such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, effectively creates photorealistic scenes from sparse viewpoints, typically evaluated by quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).</description>

      <title>Dynamic Multimodal Fusion via Meta-Learning Towards Micro-Video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal information (e.g., visual, acoustic, and textual) has been widely used to enhance representation learning for micro-video recommendation. For integrating multimodal information into a joint representation of micro-video, multimodal fusion plays a vital role in the existing micro-video recommendation approaches. However, the static multimodal fusion used in previous studies is insufficient to model the various relationships among multimodal information of different micro-videos. In this paper, we develop a novel meta-learning-based multimodal fusion framework called Meta Multimodal Fusion (MetaMMF), which dynamically assigns parameters to the multimodal fusion function for each micro-video during its representation learning. Specifically, MetaMMF regards the multimodal fusion of each micro-video as an independent task. Based on the meta information extracted from the multimodal features of the input task, MetaMMF parameterizes a neural network as the item-specific fusion function via a meta learner. We perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating the significant improvements over several state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation models, like MMGCN, LATTICE, and InvRL. Furthermore, we lighten our model by adopting canonical polyadic decomposition to improve the training efficiency, and validate its effectiveness through experimental results.

      <title>Depth and Image Fusion for Road Obstacle Detection Using Stereo Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the detection of objects on a road, performed with a combination of two methods based on both the use of depth information and video analysis of data from a stereo camera. Since neither the time of the appearance of an object on the road, nor its size and shape is known in advance, ML/DL-based approaches are not applicable. The task becomes more complicated due to variations in artificial illumination, inhomogeneous road surface texture, and unknown character and features of the object. To solve this problem we developed the depth and image fusion method that complements a search of small contrast objects by RGB-based method, and obstacle detection by stereo image-based approach with SLIC superpixel segmentation. We conducted experiments with static and low speed obstacles in an underground parking lot and demonstrated the successful work of the developed technique for detecting and even tracking small objects, which can be parking infrastructure objects, things left on the road, wheels, dropped boxes, etc.</description>

      <title>Audio-CoT: Exploring Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks involving audio perception and understanding, such as speech recognition and audio captioning. However, their reasoning capabilities - critical for solving complex real-world problems - remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct the first exploration into integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LALMs to enhance their reasoning ability across auditory modalities. We evaluate representative CoT methods, analyzing their performance in both information extraction and reasoning tasks across sound, music, and speech domains. Our findings reveal that CoT methods significantly improve performance on easy and medium tasks but encounter challenges with hard tasks, where reasoning chains can confuse the model rather than improve accuracy. Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between reasoning path length and accuracy, demonstrating the potential of scaling inference for advanced instruction-following and reasoning. This study not only highlights the promise of CoT in enhancing LALM reasoning capabilities but also identifies key limitations and provides actionable directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Exploring Transferability of Multimodal Adversarial Samples for Vision-Language Pre-training Models with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of visual and textual data in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models is crucial for enhancing vision-language understanding. However, the adversarial robustness of these models, especially in the alignment of image-text features, has not yet been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we introduce a novel gradient-based multimodal adversarial attack method, underpinned by contrastive learning, to improve the transferability of multimodal adversarial samples in VLP models. This method concurrently generates adversarial texts and images within imperceptive perturbation, employing both image-text and intra-modal contrastive loss. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on image-text retrieval and visual entailment tasks, using publicly available datasets in a black-box setting. Extensive experiments indicate a significant advancement over existing single-modal transfer-based adversarial attack methods and current multimodal adversarial attack approaches.</description>

      <title>CAMSIC: Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08505v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/CAMSIC.</description>

      <title>BeFA: A General Behavior-driven Feature Adapter for Multimedia Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimedia recommender systems focus on utilizing behavioral information and content information to model user preferences. Typically, it employs pre-trained feature encoders to extract content features, then fuses them with behavioral features. However, pre-trained feature encoders often extract features from the entire content simultaneously, including excessive preference-irrelevant details. We speculate that it may result in the extracted features not containing sufficient features to accurately reflect user preferences. To verify our hypothesis, we introduce an attribution analysis method for visually and intuitively analyzing the content features. The results indicate that certain products' content features exhibit the issues of information drift}and information omission,reducing the expressive ability of features. Building upon this finding, we propose an effective and efficient general Behavior-driven Feature Adapter (BeFA) to tackle these issues. This adapter reconstructs the content feature with the guidance of behavioral information, enabling content features accurately reflecting user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the adapter across all multimedia recommendation methods. Our code is made publicly available on https://github.com/fqldom/BeFA.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Water: Inferring Physical Properties from Pouring Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between audio-visual observations and the underlying physics of a mundane yet intriguing everyday activity: pouring liquids. Given only the sound of liquid pouring into a container, our objective is to automatically infer physical properties such as the liquid level, the shape and size of the container, the pouring rate and the time to fill. To this end, we: (i) show in theory that these properties can be determined from the fundamental frequency (pitch); (ii) train a pitch detection model with supervision from simulated data and visual data with a physics-inspired objective; (iii) introduce a new large dataset of real pouring videos for a systematic study; (iv) show that the trained model can indeed infer these physical properties for real data; and finally, (v) we demonstrate strong generalization to various container shapes, other datasets, and in-the-wild YouTube videos. Our work presents a keen understanding of a narrow yet rich problem at the intersection of acoustics, physics, and learning. It opens up applications to enhance multisensory perception in robotic pouring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an evolving research field aimed at enabling machines to answer questions about visual content by integrating image and language processing techniques such as feature extraction, object detection, text embedding, natural language understanding, and language generation. With the growth of multimodal data research, VQA has gained significant attention due to its broad applications, including interactive educational tools, medical image diagnosis, customer service, entertainment, and social media captioning. Additionally, VQA plays a vital role in assisting visually impaired individuals by generating descriptive content from images. This survey introduces a taxonomy of VQA architectures, categorizing them based on design choices and key components to facilitate comparative analysis and evaluation. We review major VQA approaches, focusing on deep learning-based methods, and explore the emerging field of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) that have demonstrated success in multimodal tasks like VQA. The paper further examines available datasets and evaluation metrics essential for measuring VQA system performance, followed by an exploration of real-world VQA applications. Finally, we highlight ongoing challenges and future directions in VQA research, presenting open questions and potential areas for further development. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the latest advancements and future</description>
