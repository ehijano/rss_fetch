      <title>Geometric normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a local analytic diffeomorphism of the plane with an irrational elliptic fixed point at 0, we introduce the notion of ``geometric normalization'', which includes the classical formal normalizations as a special case: it is a formal conjugacy to a formal diffeomorphism which preserves the foliation by circles centered at 0. We show that geometric normalizations, despite of non-uniqueness, correspond in a natural way to a unique formal invariant foliation. We show, in various contexts, generic results of divergence for the geometric normalizations, which amount to the generic non-existence of any analytic invariant foliation.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and Observability Analysis for Epidemiological Models: Insights on the SIRS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems of observability and identifiability have been of great interest as previous steps to estimating parameters and initial conditions of dynamical systems to which some known data (observations) are associated. While most works focus on linear and polynomial/rational systems of ODEs, general nonlinear systems have received far less attention and, to the best of our knowledge, no general constructive methodology has been proposed to assess and guarantee parameter and state recoverability in this context. We consider a class of systems of parameterized nonlinear ODEs and some observations, and study if a system of this class is observable, identifiable or jointly observable-identifiable; our goal is to identify its parameters and/or reconstruct the initial condition from the data. To achieve this, we introduce a family of efficient and fully constructive procedures that allow recoverability of the unknowns with low computational cost and address the aforementioned gap. Each procedure is tailored to different observational scenarios and based on the resolution of linear systems. As a case study, we apply these procedures to several epidemic models, with a detailed focus on the SIRS model, demonstrating its joined observability-identifiability when only a portion of the infected individuals is measured, a scenario that has not been studied before. In contrast, for the same observations, the SIR model is observable and identifiable, but not jointly observable-identifiable. This distinction allows us to introduce a novel approach to discriminating between different epidemiological models (SIR vs. SIRS) from short-time data. For these two models, we illustrate the theoretical results through some numerical experiments, validating the approach and highlighting its practical applicability to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stable Synchronous Propagation in Feedforward Networks for Biped Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhythmic gait patterns in animal locomotion are widely believed to be produced by a central pattern generator (CPG), a network of neurons that drives the muscle groups. In previous papers we have discussed how phase-synchronous signals can propagate along chains of neurons using a feedforward lift of the CPG, given sufficient conditions for stability to synchrony-breaking perturbations, and shown that stable signals are common for
  four standard neuron models. Here we apply these ideas to biped locomotion using a fifth model: Wilson-Cowan (or rate model) neurons. Feedforward architecture propagates the phase pattern of a CPG along a chain of identical modules. For certain rate models, we give analytic conditions that are sufficient for transverse Liapunov and Floquet stability. We compare different notions of transverse stability, summarise some numerical simulations, and outline an application to signal propagation in a model of biped locomotion.</description>

      <title>On Effective Banach-Mazur Games and an application to the Poincar\'e Recurrence Theorem for Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Banach-Mazur game characterizes sets of first category in a topological space. In this work, we show that an effectivized version of the game yields a characterization of sets of effective first category. Using this, we give a proof for the effective Banach Category Theorem. Further, we provide a game-theoretic proof of an effective theorem in dynamical systems, namely the category version of Poincar\'e Recurrence. The Poincar\'e Recurrence Theorem for category states that for a homeomorphism without open wandering sets, the set of non recurrent points forms a first category (meager) set. As an application of the effectivization of the Banach-Mazur game, we show that such a result holds true in effective settings as well.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian formulation for the motion of an active spheroidal particle suspended in laminar straight duct flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of Z\"{o}ttl and Stark's model of active spherical particles [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 218104 (2012)] and prolate spheroidal particles [Eur. Phys. J. E 36(1), 4 (2013)] suspended in cylindrical Poiseuille flow, to particle dynamics in an arbitrary unidirectional steady laminar flow through a straight duct geometry. Our primary contribution is to describe a Hamiltonian formulation of these systems and provide explicit forms of the constants of motions in terms of the arbitrary fluid velocity field. The Hamiltonian formulation provides a convenient and robust approach to the computation of particle orbits whilst also providing new insights into the dynamics, specifically the way in which orbits are trapped within basins defined by a potential well. In addition to considering spherical and prolate spheroidal particles, we also illustrate that the model can be adapted to oblate spheroidal particles.</description>

      <title>Extension Research of Principal Bundle Constraint System Theory on Ricci-flat K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the geometric mechanics theory of constraint systems on principal bundles from the flat connection case to the general situation with non-zero curvature. Based on the theoretical foundation of compatible pairs under strong transversality conditions and principal bundle constraint systems, we systematically study the behavior of compatible pair theory in non-flat geometry within the context of Ricci-flat K\"ahler manifolds. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that the fundamental framework of strong transversality conditions and compatible pairs possesses universality and does not depend on the flatness assumption of connections. Furthermore, we re-derive the dynamical connection equations incorporating curvature reaction terms and extend Spencer cohomology theory to a spectral sequence structure capable of precisely encoding curvature information. The research reveals the exact action mechanism of curvature $\Omega$: it plays a crucial role through the integrability condition $\text{ad}_\Omega^* \lambda = 0$ and higher-order differentials in Spencer cohomology, while maintaining the fundamental structure of the theoretical framework unchanged. This extension not only deepens the geometric coupling theory between constraint systems and gauge fields but also provides new mathematical tools for modern gauge field theory, string theory geometry, and related topological analysis, demonstrating the profound connections between constraint geometry and classical differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Propagation of Periodic Signals in Feedforward Networks of Standard Model Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic signals propagating along chains are common in biology, for example in locomotion and peristalsis, and are also of interest for continuum robots. In previous work we constructed such networks as 'feedforward lifts' of a central pattern generator (CPG). When the CPG undergoes periodic oscillations, created by Hopf bifurcation or other mechanisms, it can then transmit periodic signals along one or more feedforward chains in a synchronous or phase-synchronous manner. We proved necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of these lifted periodic orbits, in several senses. Here we examine the implications of the resulting theory for chains of neurons, using several standard neuron models: FitzHugh-Nagumo, Morris-Lecar, Hindmarsh-Rose, and Hodgkin-Huxley. We compare different notions of transverse stability, and summarize some numerical simulations showing that for all these neuron models the propagating signal can be transversely Floquet stable. Finally we discuss implications for less idealized models.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games without Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) models implicitly assume "rational expectations", meaning that the heterogeneous agents being modeled correctly know all relevant transition probabilities for the complex system they inhabit. When there is common noise, this assumption results in the "Master equation" (a.k.a. "Monster equation"), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in "MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling", i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of "equilibrium prices." In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.</description>

      <title>Surfaces with Klein bottle topology occur in fusion reactor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic confinement fusion devices, such as tokamaks and stellarators, are designed such that magnetic field lines lie in magnetic surfaces that form a foliation of nested genus-1 tori. The Poincar\'e-Hopf index theorem implies that only surfaces with genus 1 allow for vector fields that lie tangent to the surface and are are smooth and nowhere-vanishing. It is often implicitly assumed that magnetic surfaces are always toroidal. This paper we show that surfaces with the topology of an immersed Klein bottle (the only other genus-1 compact surface) can also occur in fusion reactor fields.
  These surfaces occur around fixed points of the Poincar\'e map that are reflection-hyperbolic, and are spanned by the field lines that asymptotically approach and depart from this closed line. Configurations in which this occurs appear in the stellarator database QUASR, and have been described in literature in the context of abnormal satwooth crashes.</description>

      <title>Classification of connection graphs of global attractors for $S^1$-equivariant parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15581v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the characterization of global attractors $A_f$ for semiflows generated by scalar one-dimensional semilinear parabolic equations of the form $u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x)$, defined on the circle $x\in S^1$, for a class of reversible nonlinearities. Given two reversible nonlinearities, $f_0$ and $f_1$, with the same lap signature, we prove the existence of a reversible homotopy $f_\tau, 0\le\tau\le 1$, which preserves all heteroclinic connections. Consequently, we obtain a classification of the connection graphs of global attractors in the class of reversible nonlinearities. We also describe bifurcation diagrams which reduce a global attractor $A_1$ to the trivial global attractor $A_0=\{0\}$.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study eigenfunction localization for higher dimensional cat maps, a popular model of quantum chaos. These maps are given by linear symplectic maps in ${\mathrm{Sp}}(2g,\mathbb Z)$, which we take to be ergodic. Under some natural assumptions, we show that there is a density one sequence of integers $N$ so that as $N$ tends to infinity along this sequence, all eigenfunctions of the quantized map at the inverse Planck constant $N$ are uniformly distributed. For the two-dimensional case ($g=1$), this was proved by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). The higher dimensional case offers several new features and requires a completely different set of tools, including from additive combinatorics, in particular Bourgain's bound (2005) for Mordell sums, and a study of tensor product structures for the cat map.</description>

      <title>Robust heteroclinic cycles in pluridimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heteroclinic cycles are sequences of equilibria along with trajectories that connect them in a cyclic manner. We investigate a class of robust heteroclinic cycles that does not satisfy the usual condition that all connections between equilibria lie in flow-invariant subspaces of equal dimension. We refer to these as robust heteroclinic cycles in pluridimensions. The stability of these cycles cannot be expressed in terms of ratios of contracting and expanding eigenvalues in the usual way because, when the subspace dimensions increase, the equilibria fail to have contracting eigenvalues. We develop the stability theory for robust heteroclinic cycles in pluridimensions, allowing for the absence of contracting eigenvalues. We present four new examples, each with four equilibria and living in four dimensions, that illustrate the stability calculations. Potential applications include modelling the dynamics of evolving populations when there are transitions between equilibria corresponding to mixed populations with different numbers of species.</description>
