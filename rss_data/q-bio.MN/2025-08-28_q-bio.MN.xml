      <title>Practical indistinguishability in a gene regulatory network inference problem, a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computationally inferring mechanistic insights from typical biological data is a challenging pursuit. Even the highest-quality experimental data come with challenges. There are always sources of noise, a limit to how often we can measure the system, and we can rarely measure all the relevant states that participate in the underlying complexity. There are usually sources of uncertainty in model development, which give rise to multiple competing model structures. To underscore the need for further analysis of structural uncertainty in modeling, we use a meta-analysis across six journals covering mathematical biology and show that a huge number of models for biological systems are developed each year, but model selection and comparison across model structures appear to be less common. We walk through a case study involving inference of regulatory network structure involved in a developmental decision in the nematode, \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}. We use real biological data and compare across 13,824 models--each corresponding to a different regulatory network structure, to determine which regulatory features are supported by the data across three experimental conditions. We find that the best-fitting models for each experimental condition share a combination of features and identify a regulatory network that is common across the model sets for each condition. This model can describe the data across the experimental conditions we considered and exhibits a high degree of positive regulation and interconnectivity between the key regulators, \textit{eud-1}, $textit{sult-1}, and \textit{nhr-40}. While the biological results are specific to the molecular biology of development in \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}, the general modeling framework and underlying challenges we faced doing this analysis are widespread across biology, chemistry, physics, and many other scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>drGT: Attention-Guided Gene Assessment of Drug Response Utilizing a Drug-Cell-Gene Heterogeneous Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A challenge in drug response prediction is result interpretation compared to established knowledge. drGT is a graph deep learning model that predicts sensitivity and aids in biomarker identification using attention coefficients (ACs). drGT leverages a heterogeneous graph composed of relationships drawn from drugs, genes, and cell line responses. The model is trained and evaluated using major benchmark datasets: Sanger GDSC, NCI60, and Broad CTRP, which cover a wide range of drugs and cancer cell lines. drGT demonstrates AUROC of up to 94.5% under random splitting, 84.4% for unseen drugs, and 70.6% for unseen cell lines, comparable to existing benchmark methods while also providing interpretability. Regarding interpretability, we review drug-gene co-occurrences by text-mining PubMed abstracts for high-coefficient genes mentioning particular drugs. Across 976 drugs from NCI60 with known drug-target interactions (DTIs), model predictions utilized both known DTIs (36.9%) as well as additional predictive associations, many supported by literature. In addition, we compare the drug-gene associations identified by drGT with those from an established DTI prediction model and find that 63.67% are supported by either PubMed literature or predictions from the DTI model. Further, we describe the utilization of ACs to identify affected biological processes by each drug via enrichment analyses, thereby enhancing biological interpretability.
