      <title>Experimental and Numerical Study of the Transient Response of a Cantilever Beam with a Piezoelectric Disc Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online and real-time sensing and monitoring of the health state of complex structures, such as aircraft and critical components of power stations, are essential aspects of research in dynamics. Several types of sensors are used to capture dynamic responses and monitor changes during the operation of critical parts of complex systems. Piezoelectric (PZ) materials belong to a class of electroactive materials that convert mechanical deformation into an electrical response. For example, PZ ceramics or PVDF foils are employed for online sensing of the time history of mechanical deformation. This paper focuses on the dynamical response of a cantilever beam structure equipped with a glued PZ sensor and combines experimental and modelling approaches to achieve accurate and reliable results. The time history of the normal velocity at a point on the beam surface was recorded with a laser vibrometer during transient vibrations of the beam, triggered by the sudden removal of a mass load at the beam's free end. Simultaneously, the output voltage of the PZ sensor was measured with an electronic device. An elastodynamic model of a cantilever beam coupled with a piezoelectric sensor is introduced, along with its discretization using the finite element method. The mathematical model includes additional terms that enforce a floating-potential boundary condition to maintain a constant charge on one of the sensor's electrodes and is presented in an extended form suitable for sensitivity analysis or parameter identification. The model implementation is validated using a numerical example corresponding to the experimental setup. The computed results show good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, values of the Rayleigh damping parameters were identified based on the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation of Literature-derived Polymer Knowledge: The Example of a Biodegradable Polymer Expert System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer literature contains a large and growing body of experimental knowledge, yet much of it is buried in unstructured text and inconsistent terminology, making systematic retrieval and reasoning difficult. Existing tools typically extract narrow, study-specific facts in isolation, failing to preserve the cross-study context required to answer broader scientific questions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising way to overcome this limitation by combining large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval, but its effectiveness depends strongly on how domain knowledge is represented. In this work, we develop two retrieval pipelines: a dense semantic vector-based approach (VectorRAG) and a graph-based approach (GraphRAG). Using over 1,000 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) papers, we construct context-preserving paragraph embeddings and a canonicalized structured knowledge graph supporting entity disambiguation and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate these pipelines through standard retrieval metrics, comparisons with general state-of-the-art systems such as GPT and Gemini, and qualitative validation by a domain chemist. The results show that GraphRAG achieves higher precision and interpretability, while VectorRAG provides broader recall, highlighting complementary trade-offs. Expert validation further confirms that the tailored pipelines, particularly GraphRAG, produce well-grounded, citation-reliable responses with strong domain relevance. By grounding every statement in evidence, these systems enable researchers to navigate the literature, compare findings across studies, and uncover patterns that are difficult to extract manually. More broadly, this work establishes a practical framework for building materials science assistants using curated corpora and retrieval design, reducing reliance on proprietary models while enabling trustworthy literature analysis at scale.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Implicit Cooperation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach Towards Decentralized Local Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes implicit cooperation, a framework enabling decentralized agents to approximate optimal coordination in local energy markets without explicit peer-to-peer communication. We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem that is solved through a multi-agent reinforcement learning task in which agents use stigmergic signals (key performance indicators at the system level) to infer and react to global states. Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>MARLEM: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation Framework for Implicit Cooperation in Decentralized Local Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, open-source MARL simulation framework for studying implicit cooperation in LEMs, modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and implemented as a Gymnasium environment for MARL. Our framework features a modular market platform with plug-and-play clearing mechanisms, physically constrained agent models (including battery storage), a realistic grid network, and a comprehensive analytics suite to evaluate emergent coordination. The main contribution is a novel method to foster implicit cooperation, where agents' observations and rewards are enhanced with system-level key performance indicators to enable them to independently learn strategies that benefit the entire system and aim for collectively beneficial outcomes without explicit communication. Through representative case studies (available in a dedicated GitHub repository in https://github.com/salazarna/marlem, we show the framework's ability to analyze how different market configurations (such as varying storage deployment) impact system performance. This illustrates its potential to facilitate emergent coordination, improve market efficiency, and strengthen grid stability. The proposed simulation framework is a flexible, extensible, and reproducible tool for researchers and practitioners to design, test, and validate strategies for future intelligent, decentralized energy systems.</description>

      <title>Federated Graph AGI for Cross-Border Insider Threat Intelligence in Government Financial Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-border insider threats pose a critical challenge to government financial schemes, particularly when dealing with distributed, privacy-sensitive data across multiple jurisdictions. Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.</description>

      <title>Modeling Trust and Liquidity Under Payment System Stress: A Multi-Agent Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operational disruptions in retail payments can induce behavioral responses that outlast technical recovery and may amplify liquidity stress. We propose a multi-agent model linking card payment outages to trust dynamics, channel avoidance, and threshold-gated withdrawals. Customers and merchants interact through repeated payment attempts, while customers additionally influence one another on a Watts-Strogatz small-world network. Customers update bounded memory variables capturing accumulated negative experience (scar) and perceived systemic risk (rumor), with merchants contributing persistent broadcast signals that may lag operational recovery. We prove that, under mild conditions on memory persistence and threshold gating, aggregate withdrawal pressure can peak strictly after the outage nadir, including during the recovery phase. Simulations reproduce behavioral hysteresis and confirm delayed peaks of outflows. We further study payment substitution via instant transfer: substitution consistently reduces peak avoidance, yet its effect on cumulative outflows is non-monotonic under realistic merchant broadcast persistence. Robustness experiments across random seeds show stable qualitative behavior. The model highlights why "status green" is not equivalent to risk resolution and motivates incident response strategies that address perception, merchant messaging, and post-recovery communication in addition to technical remediation.</description>

      <title>Learning Gradient Flow: Using Equation Discovery to Accelerate Engineering Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of data-driven equation discovery for dynamical systems to model and forecast continuous-time dynamics of unconstrained optimization problems. To avoid expensive evaluations of the objective function and its gradient, we leverage trajectory data on the optimization variables to learn the continuous-time dynamics associated with gradient descent, Newton's method, and ADAM optimization. The discovered gradient flows are then solved as a surrogate for the original optimization problem. To this end, we introduce the Learned Gradient Flow (LGF) optimizer, which is equipped to build surrogate models of variable polynomial order in full- or reduced-dimensional spaces at user-defined intervals in the optimization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several standard problems from engineering mechanics and scientific machine learning, including two inverse problems, structural topology optimization, and two forward solves with different discretizations. Our results suggest that the learned gradient flows can significantly expedite convergence by capturing critical features of the optimization trajectory while avoiding expensive evaluations of the objective and its gradient.</description>
