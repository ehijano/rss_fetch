      <title>Model-based Estimation of Difference-in-Differences with Staggered Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model-based framework for estimating treatment effects in Difference-in-Differences (DiD) designs with multiple time-periods and variation in treatment timing. We first present a simple model for potential outcomes that respects the identifying conditions for the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT's). The model-based perspective is particularly valuable in applications with small sample sizes, where existing estimators that rely on asymptotic arguments may yield poor approximations to the sampling distribution of group-time ATT's. To improve parsimony and guide prior elicitation, we reparametrize the model in a way that reduces the effective number of parameters. Prior information about treatment effects is incorporated through black-box training sample priors and, in small-sample settings, by thick-tailed t-priors that shrink ATT's of small magnitudes toward zero. We provide a straightforward and computationally efficient Bayesian estimation procedure and establish a Bernstein-von Mises-type result that justifies posterior inference for the treatment effects. Simulation studies confirm that our method performs well in both large and small samples, offering credible uncertainty quantification even in settings that challenge standard estimators. We illustrate the practical value of the method through an empirical application that examines the effect of minimum wage increases on teen employment in the United States.</description>

      <title>Large structural VARs with multiple linear shock and impact inequality restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high-dimensional structural vector autoregression framework capable of accommodating a large number of linear inequality restrictions on impact impulse responses, structural shocks, and their element-wise products. Combining impact- and shock-inequality restrictions can be flexibly used to sharpen inference and to disentangle structurally interpretable shocks through sign and shock constraints. To estimate the model, we develop a highly efficient sampling algorithm that scales well with model dimension and the number of inequality restrictions on impact responses, as well as structural shocks. It remains computationally feasible even when existing algorithms may break down. To demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, we identify five structural shocks and examine the dynamic responses of thirty macroeconomic variables, highlighting the model's flexibility and feasibility in complex empirical settings. We provide empirical evidence that financial shocks are the most important driver of the dynamics of the business cycle.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of financial data differentiation techniques using LSTM neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare traditional approach of computing logarithmic returns with the fractional differencing method and its tempered extension as methods of data preparation before their usage in advanced machine learning models. Differencing parameters are estimated using multiple techniques. The empirical investigation is conducted on data from four major stock indices covering the most recent 10-year period. The set of explanatory variables is additionally extended with technical indicators. The effectiveness of the differencing methods is evaluated using both forecast error metrics and risk-adjusted return trading performance metrics. The findings suggest that fractional differentiation methods provide a suitable data transformation technique, improving the predictive model forecasting performance. Furthermore, the generated predictions appeared to be effective in constructing profitable trading strategies for both individual assets and a portfolio of stock indices. These results underline the importance of appropriate data transformation techniques in financial time series forecasting, supporting the application of memory-preserving techniques.</description>

      <title>Inference for the proportional odds cumulative logit model with monotonicity constraints for ordinal predictors and ordinal response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.04946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proportional odds cumulative logit model (POCLM) is a standard regression model for an ordinal response. Ordinality of predictors can be incorporated by monotonicity constraints for the corresponding parameters. It is shown that estimators defined by optimization, such as maximum likelihood estimators, for an unconstrained model and for parameters in the interior set of the parameter space of a constrained model are asymptotically equivalent. This is used in order to derive asymptotic confidence regions and tests for the constrained model, involving simple modifications for finite samples. The finite sample coverage probability of the confidence regions is investigated by simulation. Tests concern the effect of individual variables, monotonicity, and a specified monotonicity direction. The methodology is applied on real data related to the assessment of school performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Decision Rules when Payoffs are Partially Identified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically optimal statistical decision rules for discrete choice problems when payoffs depend on a partially-identified parameter $\theta$ and the decision maker can use a point-identified parameter $\mu$ to deduce restrictions on $\theta$. Examples include treatment choice under partial identification and pricing with rich unobserved heterogeneity. Our notion of optimality combines a minimax approach to handle the ambiguity from partial identification of $\theta$ given $\mu$ with an average risk minimization approach for $\mu$. We show how to implement optimal decision rules using the bootstrap and (quasi-)Bayesian methods in both parametric and semiparametric settings. We provide detailed applications to treatment choice and optimal pricing. Our asymptotic approach is well suited for realistic empirical settings in which the derivation of finite-sample optimal rules is intractable.</description>

      <title>Regression Adjustment, Cross-Fitting, and Randomized Experiments with Many Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies estimation and inference for average treatment effects in randomized experiments with many covariates, under a design-based framework with a deterministic number of treated units. We show that a simple yet powerful cross-fitted regression adjustment achieves bias-correction and leads to sharper asymptotic properties than existing alternatives. Specifically, we derive higher-order stochastic expansions, analyze associated inference procedures, and propose a modified HC3 variance estimator that accounts for up to second-order. Our analysis reveals that cross-fitting permits substantially faster growth in the covariate dimension $p$ relative to sample size $n$, with asymptotic normality holding under favorable designs when $p = o(n^{3/4}/(\log n)^{1/2})$, improving on standard rates. We also explain and address the poor size performance of conventional variance estimators. The methodology extends naturally to stratified experiments with many strata. Simulations confirm that the cross-fitted estimator, combined with the modified HC3, delivers accurate estimation and reliable inference across diverse designs.</description>

      <title>Design-based Estimation Theory for Complex Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the estimation of treatment effects in randomized experiments with complex experimental designs, including cases with interference between units. We develop a design-based estimation theory for arbitrary experimental designs. Our theory facilitates the analysis of many design-estimator pairs that researchers commonly employ in practice and provide procedures to consistently estimate asymptotic variance bounds. We propose new classes of estimators with favorable asymptotic properties from a design-based point of view. In addition, we propose a scalar measure of experimental complexity which can be linked to the design-based variance of the estimators. We demonstrate the performance of our estimators using simulated datasets based on an actual network experiment studying the effect of social networks on insurance adoptions.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Frontier Structural Function and Bounding Mean Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a model in which an outcome variable equals a frontier function of inputs less a nonnegative unobserved deviation. If zero lies in the support of the deviation given inputs, then the frontier function is identified by the supremum outcome at those inputs. This obviates the need for instrumental variables. Implementation requires allowing for the distribution of deviations to depend on inputs, thus not ruling out endogeneity. Including random errors yields a stochastic frontier analysis model. We generalize this model to allow the joint distribution of deviations and errors to depend on inputs. We derive a lower bound for the mean deviation based only on variance and skewness, requiring no other distributional assumptions and remaining valid even when zero is not in the support of deviations or data are sparse near the frontier. We apply our results to a frontier production function, where deviations represent inefficiencies.</description>
