      <title>Parallel Diffusion Coefficient of Energetic Charged Particles in the Inner Heliosphere from the Turbulent Magnetic Fields Measured by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\parallel$ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5-13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 AU, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1GeV. We find that $\kappa_\parallel$ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in $\kappa_\parallel$ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of $\kappa_{\parallel}=(5.16\pm1.22) \times 10^{18} \: r^{1.17\pm0.08} \: E^{0.71\pm 0.02} \; (cm^2/s)$ in the inner heliosphere which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Effects of wave damping and finite perpendicular scale on three-dimensional Alfv\'en wave parametric decay in low-beta plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear Alfven wave parametric decay instability (PDI) provides a potential path toward significant wave dissipation and plasma heating. However, fundamental questions regarding how PDI is excited in a realistic three-dimensional (3D) open system and how critically the finite perpendicular wave scale -- as found in both the laboratory and space plasmas -- affects the excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first 3D, open-boundary, hybrid kinetic-fluid simulations of kinetic Alfven wave PDI in low-beta plasmas. Key findings are that the PDI excitation is strongly limited by the wave damping present, including electron-ion collisional damping (represented by a constant resistivity) and geometrical attenuation associated with the finite-scale Alfven wave, and ion Landau damping of the child acoustic wave. The perpendicular wave scale alone, however, plays no discernible role, with different wave scales exhibiting similar instability growth. These findings are corroborated by theoretical analysis and estimates. The new understanding of 3D kinetic Alfven wave PDI physics is essential for laboratory study of the basic plasma process and may also help evaluate the relevance/role of PDI in low-beta space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Analytic model and MHD simulations of three-dimensional magnetic switchbacks</title>

Abstract: Parker Solar Probe observations reveal that the near-Sun space is almost filled with magnetic switchbacks (``switchbacks'' hereinafter), which may be a major contributor to the heating and acceleration of solar wind. Here, for the first time, we develop an analytic model of an axisymmetric switchback with uniform magnetic field strength. In this model, three parameters control the geometry of the switchback: height (length along the background magnetic field), width (thickness along radial direction perpendicular to the background field), and the radial distance from the center of switchback to the central axis, which is a proxy of the size of the switchback along the third dimension. We carry out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the dynamic evolution of the switchback. Comparing simulations conducted with compressible and incompressible codes, we verify that compressibility, i.e. parametric decay instability, is necessary for destabilizing the switchback. Our simulations also reveal that the geometry of the switchback significantly affects how fast the switchback destabilizes. The most stable switchbacks are 2D-like (planar) structures with large aspect ratios (length to width), consistent with the observations. We show that when plasma beta ($\beta$) is smaller than one, the switchback is more stable as $\beta$ increases. However, when $\beta$ is greater than one, the switchback becomes very unstable as the pattern of the growing compressive fluctuations changes. Our results may explain some of the observational features of switchbacks, including the large aspect ratios and nearly constant occurrence rates in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Model For Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical-star formation simulations have resolved the formation of quasar accretion disks with Eddington or super-Eddington accretion rates onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) down to a few hundred gravitational radii. These 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks appear to be qualitatively distinct from classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks: the midplane pressure is dominated by toroidal magnetic fields with plasma $\beta \ll 1$ powered by advection of magnetic flux from the interstellar medium (ISM), and they are super-sonically and trans-Alfvenically turbulent with cooling times short compared to dynamical times yet remain gravitationally stable owing to magnetic support. In this paper, we present a simple analytic similarity model for such disks. For reasonable assumptions, the model is entirely specified by the boundary conditions (inflow rate at the BH radius of influence [BHROI]). We show that the scalings from this model are robust to various detailed assumptions, agree remarkably well with the simulations (given their simplicity), and demonstrate the self-consistency and gravitational stability of such disks even in the outer accretion disk (approaching the BHROI) at hyper-Eddington accretion rates.</description>
