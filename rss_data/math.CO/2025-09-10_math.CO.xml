      <title>On the independence number in subcubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a connected subcubic graph $G\neq K_1$ let $V_i(G) = \{v \in V(G) ~|~ d_G(v)=i\}$ for $1 \leq i \leq 3.$ Given $c_1, c_2, c_ 3 \in \mathbb{R}^+$ and $ d \in \mathbb{R}$,
  we show several results of type $\alpha(G) \geq c_1|V_1(G)| + c_2|V_2(G)| + c_3|V_3(G)| - d.$ We also derive classes of graphs $G$ showing sharpness of these lower bounds on the independence number $\alpha(G)$ of $G$.</description>

      <title>Bisection width, max-cut and internal partitions of 5-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new factor of IID process based on the local algorithm introduced by D\'iaz, Serna, and Wormald (2007). This new approach allows us to improve the previously known upper bounds on the minimum and maximum bisection width and the maximum cut of random d-regular graphs for d &gt; 4 by introducing a new recoloring phase after the termination of the original algorithm. As an application, we show that random 5-regular graphs asymptotically almost surely admit an internal partition, i.e., a partition of the vertex set into two nonempty classes so that every vertex has at least half of its neighbors in its own class.</description>

      <title>DDE-SOLVER: A Maple Package For Discrete Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DDE-Solver, a Maple package designed for solving Discrete Differential Equations (DDEs). These equations are functional equations relating algebraically a formal power series F(t, u) with polynomial coefficients in a "catalytic" variable u, with specializations of it with respect to the catalytic variable. Such equations appear in enumerative combinatorics, for instance in the enumeration of maps. Bousquet-Melou and Jehanne showed in 2006 that when these equations are of a fixed point type in F, then F is an algebraic series. In the same paper, they proposed a systematic method for computing annihilating polynomials of these series. Bostan, Safey El Din and the author of this paper recently designed new efficient algorithms for computing these witnesses of algebraicity. This paper provides combinatorialists an automated tool in hand that solves DDEs using these algorithms. We also compare the timings of all these algorithms on DDEs from the literature.</description>

      <title>On Sidorenko exponents of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $r$-graph $F$, define Sidorenko exponent $s(F)$ as $$s(F):= \sup \{s \geq 0: \exists \text{$r$-graph $H$ s.t. } t_F(H) = t_{K^{(r)}_r} (H)^s &gt; 0\},$$ where $t_{H_1}(H_2)$ denotes the homomorphism density of $H_1$ in $H_2$. The celebrated Sidorenko's conjecture states that $s(F) = e(F)$ holds for every bipartite graph $F$. It is known that for all $r \geq 3$, the $r$-uniform version of Sidorenko's conjecture is false, and only a few hypergraphs are known to be Sidorenko.
  In this paper, we discover a new broad class of Sidorenko hypergraphs and obtain general upper bounds on $s(F)$ for certain hypergraphs related to dominating hypergraphs. This makes progress toward a problem raised by Sprio and Nie. We also discover a new connection between Sidorenko exponents and upper bounds on the extremal numbers of a large class of hypergraphs, which generalizes the hypergraph analogue of K\H{o}v\'{a}ri--S\'{o}s--Tur\'{a}n theorem proved by Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <title>Property O and Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres properties in linear hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oriented $k$-uniform hypergraph, or oriented $k$-graph, is said to satisfy Property O if, for every linear ordering of its vertex set, there is some edge oriented consistently with this order. The minimum number $f(k)$ of edges in a $k$-graph with Property O was first studied by Duffus, Kay, and R\"{o}dl, and later improved by Kronenberg, Kusch, Lamaison, Micek, and Tran. In particular, they established the bounds $k! + 1 \le f(k) \le \left(\lfloor\tfrac{k}{2}\rfloor+1 \right) k! - \lfloor\tfrac{k}{2}\rfloor(k-1)!$ for every $k \ge 2$.
  In this note, we extend the study of Property O to the linear setting. We determine the minimum number $f'(k)$ of edges in a linear $k$-graph up to a $\operatorname{poly}(k)$ multiplicative factor, showing that $\frac{(k!)^2}{2e^2k^4} \le f'(k) \le (1+o(1)) \cdot 4 k^6 \ln^2 k \cdot (k!)^2$. Our approach also yields bounds on the minimum number $n'(k)$ of vertices in an oriented linear $k$-graph with Property O. Additionally, we explore the minimum number of edges and vertices required in a linear $k$-graph satisfying the newly introduced Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres properties.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure. V. The coarse Menger conjecture in bounded path-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Menger's theorem tells us that if $S,T$ are sets of vertices in a graph $G$, then (for $k\ge0$) either there are $k+1$ vertex-disjoint paths between $S$ and $T$, or there is a set of $k$ vertices separating $S$ and $T$. But what if we want the paths to be far apart, say at distance at least $c$? One might hope that we can find either $k+1$ paths pairwise far apart, or $k$ sets of bounded radius that separate $S$ and $T$, where the bound on the radius is some $\ell$ that depends only on $k,c$ (the ``coarse Menger conjecture''). We showed in an earlier paper that this is false for all $k\ge 2$ and $c\ge3$. To do so we gave a sequence of finite graphs, counterexamples for larger and larger values of $\ell$ with $k=2$, $c=3$. Our counterexamples contained subdivisions of uniform binary trees with arbitrarily large depth as subgraphs.
  Here we show that for any binary tree $T$, the coarse Menger conjecture is true for all graphs that contain no subdivision of $T$ as a subgraph, that is, it is true for graphs with bounded path-width (and, further, for graphs with bounded coarse path-width). This is perhaps surprising, since it is false for bounded tree-width.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Upper Bound for Permanents via a Permanental Schur Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing the permanent of a non-negative matrix is a computationally challenging, \#P-complete problem with wide-ranging applications. We introduce a novel permanental analogue of Schur's determinant formula, leveraging a newly defined \emph{permanental inverse}. Building on this, we introduce an iterative, deterministic procedure called the \emph{permanent process}, analogous to Gaussian elimination, which yields constructive and algorithmically computable upper bounds on the permanent. Our framework provides particularly strong guarantees for matrices exhibiting approximate diagonal dominance-like properties, thereby offering new theoretical and computational tools for analyzing and bounding permanents.</description>

      <title>Proto-Exact Categories of Matroids over Idylls and Tropical Toric Reflexive Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the category $F$-$\textbf{Mat}_\bullet$ of matroids over an idyll $F$. We show that $F$-$\textbf{Mat}_\bullet$ is a proto-exact category, a non-additive generalization of an exact category by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov. We further show that $F$-$\textbf{Mat}_\bullet$ is proto-abelian in the sense of Andr\'e. As an application, we establish that the category $\textbf{TRS}_\bullet^\Sigma$ of tropical toric reflexive sheaves associated to a fan $\Sigma$, introduced by Khan and Maclagan, is also proto-exact and proto-abelian. We then investigate the stability of modular tropical toric reflexive sheaves within the framework of proto-abelian categories and reformulate Harder-Narasimhan filtrations in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k\ge 2$ and $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k$ be positive integers with \[ \gcd(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k)=1. \] It is proved that there exists a positive integer $G_{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k}$ such that every integer $n$ strictly greater than it can be represented as the form \[ n=a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_kx_k, \quad (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0},~\gcd(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k)=1). \] We then investigate the size of $G_{a_1, a_2}$ explicitly. Our result strengthens the primality requirement of $x$'s in the classical Diophantine Frobenius Problem.</description>

      <title>Dorst-Smeulders Coding for Arbitrary Binary Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A binary word is Sturmian if the occurrences of each letter are balanced, in the sense that in any two factors of the same length, the difference between the number of occurrences of the same letter is at most 1. In digital geometry, Sturmian words correspond to discrete approximations of straight line segments in the Euclidean plane. The Dorst-Smeulders coding, introduced in 1984, is a 4-tuple of integers that uniquely represents a Sturmian word $w$, enabling its reconstruction using $|w|$ modular operations, making it highly efficient in practice. In this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm that, given a binary input word $w$, computes the Dorst-Smeulders coding of its longest Sturmian prefix. This forms the basis for computing the Dorst-Smeulders coding of an arbitrary binary word $w$, which is a minimal decomposition (in terms of the number of factors) of $w$ into Sturmian words, each represented by its Dorst-Smeulders coding. This coding could be leveraged in compression schemes where the input is transformed into a binary word composed of long Sturmian segments. Although the algorithm is conceptually simple and can be implemented in just a few lines of code, it is grounded in a deep analysis of the structural properties of Sturmian words.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraph density. VI. Bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm a conjecture of Fox, Pach, and Suk, that for every $d&gt;0$, there exists $c&gt;0$ such that every $n$-vertex graph of VC-dimension at most $d$ has a clique or stable set of size at least $n^c$. This implies that, in the language of model theory, every graph definable in NIP structures has a clique or anti-clique of polynomial size, settling a conjecture of Chernikov, Starchenko, and Thomas.
  Our result also implies that every two-colourable tournament satisfies the tournament version of the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture, which completes the verification of the conjecture for six-vertex tournaments. The result extends to uniform hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension as well.
  The proof method uses the ultra-strong regularity lemma for graphs of bounded VC-dimension proved by Lov\'asz and Szegedy and the method of iterative sparsification introduced by the authors in an earlier paper.</description>

      <title>Induced Minor Models. I. Structural Properties and Algorithmic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is said to be an induced minor of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions and edge contractions. Equivalently, $H$ is an induced minor of $G$ if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of pairwise disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$ labeled by the vertices of $H$, each inducing a connected subgraph in $G$, such that two vertices of $H$ are adjacent if and only if there is an edge in $G$ between the corresponding subsets.
  In this paper, we investigate structural properties of induced minor models, including bounds on treewidth and chromatic number of the subgraphs induced by minimal induced minor models. It is known that for some graphs $H$, testing whether a given graph $G$ contains $H$ as an induced minor is an NP-complete problem. Nevertheless, as algorithmic applications of our structural results, we make use of recent developments regarding tree-independence number to show that if $H$ is the $4$-wheel, the $5$-vertex complete graph minus an edge, or a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,q}$, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find in a given graph $G$ an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, if there is one. We also develop an alternative polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs that do not contain $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, which revolves around the idea of detecting the induced subgraphs whose presence is forced when the input graph contains $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, using the so-called shortest path detector. It turns out that all these induced subgraphs are Truemper configurations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Dual Version of Woodall's Conjecture for Partial 3-Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dual version of a conjecture by Woodall asserts that, in a planar digraph, the length of a shortest dicycle equals the maximum number of pairwise disjoint feedback arc sets. We verify this conjecture for the case where the underlying graph is a 3-tree or a partial 3-tree with girth $3$. Additionally, we show that every 3-tree has a feedback arc set of size at most~$m/3-1$, where~$m$ is the number of arcs of the digraph, and this bound is tight. We further establish an upper bound on the size of a minimum feedback arc set in $k$-trees. Finally, we discuss some open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Colouring a graph with position sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a colouring version of the general position problem. The \emph{$\gp $-chromatic number} is the smallest number of colours needed to colour the vertices of the graph such that each colour class has the no-three-in-line property. We determine bounds on this colouring number in terms of the diameter, general position number, size, chromatic number, cochromatic number and total domination number and prove realisation results. We also determine the $\gp $-chromatic number of several graph classes, including Kneser graphs $K(n,2)$, line graphs of complete graphs, complete multipartite graphs, block graphs and Cartesian products. Finally, we show that the $\gp $-colouring problem is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Sharp bound for the Erd\H{o}s-Straus non-averaging set problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of integers $A$ is non-averaging if there is no element $a$ in $A$ which can be written as an average of a subset of $A$ not containing $a$. We show that the largest non-averaging subset of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ has size $n^{1/4+o(1)}$, thus solving the Erd\H{o}s-Straus problem. We also determine the largest size of a non-averaging set in a $d$-dimensional box for any fixed $d$. Our main tool includes the structure theorem for the set of subset sums due to Conlon, Fox and the first author, together with a result about the structure of a point set in nearly convex position.</description>

      <title>Dimension of RC-lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $1941$ Dushnik and Miller introduced the concept of dimension of a poset. In $2020$ Bhavale and Waphare introduced the concept of an RC-lattice as a lattice in which all the reducible elements are lying on a chain. In this paper, we obtain the dimension of adjunct sum of two lattices. We obtain a bound on the dimension of a dismantlable lattice in terms of its nullity. We also prove that the dimension of an RC-lattice on $n$ elements is at the most three. Consequently, we prove that an RC-lattice is non planar if and only if its dimension is three.</description>

      <title>On the twin-width of near-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twin-width is a recently introduced graph parameter based on the repeated contraction of near-twins. It has shown remarkable utility in algorithmic and structural graph theory, as well as in finite model theory -- particularly since first-order model checking is fixed-parameter tractable when a witness certifying small twin-width is provided. However, the behavior of twin-width in specific graph classes, particularly cubic graphs, remains poorly understood. While cubic graphs are known to have unbounded twin-width, no explicit cubic graph of twin-width greater than 4 is known.
  This paper explores this phenomenon in regular and near-regular graph classes. We show that extremal graphs of bounded degree and high twin-width are asymmetric, partly explaining their elusiveness. Additionally, we establish bounds for circulant and d-degenerate graphs, and examine strongly regular graphs, which exhibit similar behavior to cubic graphs. Our results include determining the twin-width of Johnson graphs over 2-sets, and cyclic Latin square graphs.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic uniform distribution of subset sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order $n$, and for each $a\in G$ and integer $1\le h\le n$ let $\mathcal{F}_a(h)$ denote the family of all $h$-element subsets of $G$ whose sum is $a$. A problem posed by Katona and Makar-Limanov is to determine whether the minimum and maximum sizes of the families $\mathcal{F}_a(h)$ (as $a$ ranges over $G$) become asymptotically equal as $n\rightarrow \infty$ when $h=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$. We affirmatively answer this question and in fact show that the same asymptotic equality holds for every $4\leq h\leq \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor+1$.</description>

      <title>A Unified Closed-Form Formula for the Multi-Peg Tower of Hanoi via Simplex Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical three-peg Tower of Hanoi puzzle admits the well-known closed-form solution \(M(3,n)=2^n-1\), but the general case with \(p \geq 4\) pegs has remained an open problem for over a century. In this paper, we present a complete unified closed-form formula for the minimum number of moves \(M(p,n)\) required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for any number of pegs \(p\) and disks \(n\).
  Building upon our previous work, which introduced Menon's Conjecture \(M(p,n)=4n-2p+1\) for the restricted domain \(p-1 \leq n \leq \frac{p(p-1)}{2}\), we now extend this result to all values of \(n\). Our key insight is that the solution naturally partitions into regimes governed by simplex number boundaries, with each regime exhibiting linear growth with slopes that are successive powers of two. This leads to the unified expression: \[ M(p,n) = 2^{i+1}n - \sum_{k=0}^{i} 2^k \binom{p+k-2}{k}, \quad i = \min \left\{ j \geq 0 : n \leq \binom{p-1+j}{j+1} \right\}. \]
  We show how this formula recovers classical results, including \(M(3,n)=2^n-1\) and the four-peg Reve's Puzzle solution, as special cases. Computational verification across more than 1,750 test instances confirms perfect agreement with Frame-Stewart values. Furthermore, this closed-form reduces the complexity of determining \(M(p,n)\) from \(O(pn^2)\) to \(O(p\log n)\), providing both theoretical unification and practical computational improvements.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Vector Parking Functions and their Outcomes Based on Specified Lucky Cars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a parking function, a car is considered lucky if it is able to park in its preferred spot. Extending work of Harris and Martinez, we enumerate outcomes of parking functions with a fixed set of lucky cars. We then consider a generalization of parking functions known as vector parking functions or $\boldsymbol{u}$-parking functions, in which a nonnegative integer capacity is given to each parking spot in the street. With certain restrictions on $\boldsymbol{u}$, we enumerate outcomes of $\boldsymbol{u}$-parking functions with a fixed set of lucky cars or with a fixed number of lucky cars. We also count outcomes according to which spots contain lucky cars, and give formulas for enumerating $\boldsymbol{u}$-parking functions themselves according to their set of lucky cars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A path system in a graph $G$ is a collection of paths, with exactly one path between any two vertices in $G$. A path system is said to be consistent if it is intersection-closed. We show that the number of consistent path systems on $n$ vertices is $n^{\frac{n^2}{2}(1-o(1))}$, whereas the number of consistent path systems which are realizable as the unique geodesics w.r.t. some metric is only $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$.
  In addition, these insights allow us to improve known bounds on the face-count of the metric cone and shed new light on enumerating maximum-VC-classes.</description>

      <title>Nets of conics containing a double line in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, $q$ even</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper completes the classification of nets of conics containing at least one double line in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ for $q$ even. This classification contributes to the classification of partially symmetric tensors in $\mathbb{F}_q^3 \otimes S^2 \mathbb{F}_q^3$, $q$ even. The proof is obtained using geometric and combinatorial properties of the Veronese surface in 5-dimensional projective space over the finite field of even order. In particular, the orbits of planes in $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$ that intersect the nucleus plane of the Veronese surface in at least one point are classified. As a result, it is shown that there are exactly $18$ equivalence classes of nets in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, $q$ even, containing at least one double line, $9$ of which have an empty base.</description>

      <title>Computing Tree Decompositions with Small Independence Number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09993v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The independence number of a tree decomposition is the maximum of the independence numbers of the subgraphs induced by its bags. The tree-independence number of a graph is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like maximum weight independent set, can be solved in time n^{O(k)} if the input n-vertex graph is given together with a tree decomposition of independence number k. Yolov, in [SODA 2018], gave an algorithm that, given an n-vertex graph G and an integer k, in time n^{O(k^3)} either constructs a tree decomposition of G whose independence number is O(k^3) or correctly reports that the tree-independence number of G is larger than k.
  In this paper, we first give an algorithm for computing the tree-independence number with a better approximation ratio and running time and then prove that our algorithm is, in some sense, the best one can hope for. More precisely, our algorithm runs in time 2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)} and either outputs a tree decomposition of G with independence number at most $8k$, or determines that the tree-independence number of G is larger than k. This implies 2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}-time algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight independent set, parameterized by the tree-independence number k without needing the decomposition as an input. Assuming Gap-ETH, an n^{\Omega(k)} factor in the running time is unavoidable for any approximation algorithm for the tree-independence number.
  Our second result is that the exact computation of the tree-independence number is para-NP-hard: We show that for every constant k \ge 4 it is NP-hard to decide if a given graph has the tree-independence number at most k.</description>

Abstract: We study the Milnor fiber boundary for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^3$. This is one of the examples of non-isolated surface singularities, which are studied by N\'emethi--Szil\'ard. In this paper, we compute the first homology group of the Milnor fiber boundary for a generic arrangement, which gives an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Suciu. Also, we give an example of an arrangement with $n$ hyperplanes, whose torsion part in the Milnor fiber boundary homology contains a direct summand other than $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, for certain value of $n$.</description>

Abstract: In previous work we computed the number $C_n(q)$ of ideals of codimension $n$ of the algebra ${\mathbb{F}}_q[x,y,x^{-1}, y^{-1}]$ of two-variable Laurent polynomials over a finite field: it turned out that $C_n(q)$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n$ in $q$, divisible by $(q-1)^2$. The quotient $P_n(q) = C_n(q)/(q-1)^2$ is a palindromic polynomial of degree $2n-2$. For each $n\geq 1$ let ${\overline{P}}_n(X) \in {\mathbb{Z}}[X]$ be the degree $n-1$ polynomial such that ${\overline{P}}_n(q+q^{-1}) = P_n(q)/q^{n-1}$. In this note we show that for any integer $N$ the integer value ${\overline{P}}_n(N)$ is close to the value at $N$ of the degree $n-1$ polynomial $F_{n-1}(X) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \, {\overline{T}}_k(X)$, which is a sum of monic versions ${\overline{T}}_k(X)$ of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We give a precise formula for ${\overline{P}}_n(X)$ as a linear combination of $F_k(X)$'s, each appearance of the latter being parametrized by an odd divisor of $n$. As a consequence, ${\overline{P}}_n(X) = F_{n-1}(X)$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$. We exhibit similar formulas for $C_n(q)$.</description>

Abstract: The stability number of a graph $G$, denoted as $\alpha(G)$, is the maximum size of an independent (stable) set in $G$. Semidefinite programming (SDP) methods, which originated from Lov\'asz's theta number and expanded through lift-and-project hierarchies as well as sums of squares (SOS) relaxations, provide powerful tools for approximating $\alpha(G)$.
  We build upon the copositive formulation of $\alpha(G)$ and introduce a novel SDP-based hierarchy of inner approximations to the copositive cone COP$_n$, which is derived from structured SOS representations. This hierarchy preserves essential structural properties that are missing in existing approaches, offers an SDP feasibility formulation at each level despite its non-convexity, and converges finitely to $\alpha(G)$. Our results include examples of graph families that require at least $\alpha(G) - 1$ levels for related hierarchies, indicating the tightness of the de Klerk-Pasechnik conjecture. Notably, on those graph families, our hierarchy achieves $\alpha(G)$ in a single step.</description>
