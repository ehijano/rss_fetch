      <title>Thermodynamic Entropy as Information - A compression-based demonstration of the Shannon-Boltzmann equivalence in condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Shannon's information entropy and the thermodynamic entropy of Boltzmann and Gibbs are quantitatively equivalent for real condensed-matter systems. By interpreting atomic configurations as information sources, we compute entropy directly from the compressibility of molecular-dynamics trajectories, without physical partitioning or empirical modeling. A custom lossy-compression algorithm measures the minimum number of bits required to describe a microstate at finite precision, and this bit count maps exactly to thermodynamic entropy through the Shannon-Boltzmann relation. The method reproduces benchmark entropies for metals, semiconductors, oxides, and refractory ceramics in both solid and liquid phases, establishing information as the fundamental quantity underlying thermodynamic disorder. This equivalence unifies information theory and statistical mechanics, providing a general and computationally efficient framework for determining entropies and free energies directly from atomic data.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Simulations of the Parity Conserving Directed Percolation Universality Class in 1+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, parity conserving directed percolation (pcDP; also called parity
  conserving branching annihilating random walks, pcBARW) is the second-most important model with an absorbing state
  transition. Its distinction from ordinary DP is that particle number is conserved modulo 2, which means in 1 dimension of
  space that there are two degenerate vacuum (absorbing) states. Particles can be interpreted as domain walls between
  them, and there are two distinct sectors in systems with a finite initial number of particles: Realizations with even and
  odd particle numbers show different scaling behaviors. An intriguing feature of pcDP it is that some of its critical
  exponents seem to be very simple rational numbers. The most prominent is the one describing the average number of
  particles (or active sites) in the even sector, which is asymptotically constant. In contrast, the dynamical critical
  exponent (which is the same in both sectors) seems not close to any simple rational. Finally, the order parameter exponent
  (which is also the same in both sectors) is, according to the most precise previous simulations, $\beta = 1.020(5)$,
  and thus very close but not really compatible with a simple rational. We present high statistics simulations which
  clarifies this situation, and which indicate several other intriguing properties of pcPD clusters. In particular, we find
  $\beta = 1.000$ with the error in the next digit.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions as Emergent Geometric Phenomena: A Deterministic Entropy Evolution Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that thermodynamics can be formulated naturally from the intrinsic geometry of phase space alone-without postulating an ensemble, which instead emerges from the geometric structure itself. Within this formulation, phase transitions are encoded in the geometry of constant-energy manifold: entropy and its derivatives follow from a deterministic equation whose source is built from curvature invariants. As energy increases, geometric transformations in energy-manifold structure drive thermodynamic responses and characterize criticality. We validate this framework through explicit analysis of paradigmatic systems-the 1D XY mean-field model and 2D $\phi^4$ theory-showing that geometric transformations in energy-manifold structure characterize criticality quantitatively. The framework applies universally to long-range interacting systems and in ensemble-inequivalence regimes.</description>

      <title>Mean First Passage Time of the Symmetric Noisy Voter Model with Arbitrary Initial and Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of imitation and herding behavior often underestimate the role of individualistic actions and assume symmetric boundary conditions. However, real-world systems (e.g., electoral processes) frequently involve asymmetric boundaries. In this study, we explore how arbitrarily placed boundary conditions influence the mean first passage time in the symmetric noisy voter model, and how individualistic behavior amplifies this asymmetry. We derive exact analytical expressions for mean first passage time that accommodate any initial condition and two types of boundary configurations: (i) both boundaries absorbing, and (ii) one absorbing and one reflective. In both scenarios, mean first passage time exhibits a clear asymmetry with respect to the initial condition, shaped by the boundary placement and the rate of independent transitions. Symmetry in mean first passage time emerges only when absorbing boundaries are equidistant from the midpoint. Additionally, we show that Kramers' law holds in both configurations when the rate of independent transitions is large. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, reinforcing the robustness of our findings.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between Heider links and Ising spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Heider model with an external field is equivalent, in the limit of structural balance, to the Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions without an external field. More precisely, we claim that the signs of the Heider relations that maintain structural equilibrium in the system can be represented as nearest neighbor Ising spin products. We demonstrate this explicitly for a complete graph and provide a general argument for an arbitrary graph. A consequence of the equivalence is that the system of balanced Heider states undergoes a phase transition, inherited from the Ising model, at a critical value of the social field at which the fluctuations of edge magnetization are maximal.</description>

      <title>Using precision coefficients on recurrence times and integrated currents to lower bound the average dissipation rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For continuous-time Markov jump processes on irreducible networks and time-independent rate constants, we employ a transition-based formalism to express the long-time precision of a single integrated current over an observable channel in terms of precisions of the recurrence times of the forward and backward jumps, and of an effective affinity that captures the thermodynamic driving on that channel. This leads to a general lower bound for the stationary entropy production rate that extends the well-known Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR). Such an augmented TUR, which incorporates the statistics of the recurrences, proves to be tighter than the standard one far from equilibrium, and potentially offers new opportunities for the optimization and design of biological and chemical out-of-equilibrium systems at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Detection of Mpemba effect through good observables in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect refers to the anomalous relaxation of a quantum state that, despite being initially farther from equilibrium, relaxes faster than a closer counterpart. Detecting such a quantum Mpemba effect typically requires full knowledge of the quantum state during its time evolution, which is an experimentally challenging task since state tomography becomes exponentially difficult as system size increases. This poses a significant obstacle in studying Mpemba effect in complex many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by identifying suitable observables that signal rapid relaxation. Moreover, as long as the system equilibrates to a known unique steady-state, it is possible to fully detect the occurrence of quantum Mpemba effect just by measuring the observable for known state preparations. Our approach thus significantly reduces experimental complexity and offers a practical route for observing the quantum Mpemba effect in complex and extended multi-qubit setups.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction in the canonical ensemble. The free energy is obtained by mapping the model onto the spin-$1$ Blume-Emery-Griffiths model and solving it by using an Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation combined with the transfer matrix method. A complex structure with lines of first-order transitions, two triple points and a critical point appears at finite temperature. The phase diagram is two-dimensional, since there are two adjustable parameters, the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ and the temperature $T$. We show that the phase diagram does not present second-order phase transition lines, due to the fact that the order parameter is not a symmetry-breaking one. Quite remarkably, we are able to determine analytically one of the first-order phase-transition lines. We also prove that, when the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ is large and negative, the first-order transition temperature becomes asymptotically independent of $K$.</description>

      <title>Universality Diagram of Phase Transitions in Long-range Statistical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The percolation, Ising, and O($n$) models constitute fundamental systems in statistical and condensed matter physics. For short-range-interacting cases, the nature of their phase transitions is well established by renormalization-group theory. However, the universality of the transitions in these models remains elusive when algebraically decaying long-range interactions $\sim 1/r^{d+\sigma}$ are introduced, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $\sigma$ is the decay exponent. Building upon insights from L\'evy flight, i.e., long-range simple random walk, we propose three universality diagrams in the $(d,\sigma)$ plane for the percolation model, the O($n$) model, and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn Ising model, respectively. The conjectured universality diagrams are consistent with recent high-precision numerical studies and rigorous mathematical results, offering a unified perspective on critical phenomena in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement evolution from entangled multipodal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a periodic lattice system an entangled antipodal pair state, otherwise known as a crosscap state, is a simple two site product state in which spins at antipodal sites are prepared in Bell pairs. Such states have maximal bipartite entanglement and serve as a useful platform for studying the quench dynamics of systems which have large initial entanglement. In this paper, we study a generalization of these states which we dub entangled mutipodal states. These states, which are defined for fermionic systems, generalize the crosscap states by having correlations among more than two sites, specifically, those which sit at the vertices of regular polygons. By construction, the states are Gaussian and translationally invariant allowing many of their properties to be understood. We study the bipartite entanglement entropy of these states both in and out of equilibrium. In equilibrium, the entanglement profile as a function of subsystem size exhibits two distinct regimes, a volume-law growth followed by a saturation to a constant value, thus generalizing the Page-curve profile of the crosscap state. In the non-equilibrium setting, we study quenches from these initial states to the free-fermion chain, whose ensuing dynamics displays a far richer structure compared to the crosscap case. We interpret our results in terms of the quasiparticle picture, which requires multiplets of quasiparticles to be excited non-locally around the system. This scenario is confirmed by the appearance of a post-quench, negative tripartite information.</description>

      <title>The measurement-induced phase transition in strongly disordered spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of strongly disordered spin chains in the presence of random local measurements. By studying the transverse-field Ising model with a site-dependent random longitudinal field and an effective $l$-bit many-body localized Hamiltonian, we show that the prethermal and MBL regimes are unstable to local measurements along any direction. Any non-zero measurement density induces a volume-law entangled phase with a subsequent phase transition into an area-law state as the measurement rate is further increased. The critical measurement rate $p_c$, where the transition occurs, is exponentially small in the strength of disorder $W$ and the average overlap between the measurement operator and the local integrals of motion $O$ as $p_c \sim \exp[-\alpha W/(1-O^2)]$. In the measurement-induced volume-law phase, the saturation time scales as $t_s \sim L $, contrasting the exponentially slow saturation $t_s \sim e^{aL}$ in the prethermal and MBL regimes at $p = 0$.</description>

      <title>Observation of an anomaly in the statistics of Kibble-Zurek defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism quantifies defect formation during adiabatic passage across a continuous phase transition, providing key insights into universality in quantum many-body systems. We explore counting statistics of defects in adiabatic passage experiments on long 1D Rydberg atom chains. The experiments reveal an anomaly in the defect number distribution at long ramp times, challenging the hypothesis of defect formation through independent domain mergers. Numerical simulations confirm the anomaly and suggest its link to non-critical coarsening dynamics, which we suppress in prepare-and-hold experiments. Our results highlight the ability of quantum simulators to uncover unexpected correlated quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Network theory classification of quantum matter based on wave function snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers and simulators offer unparalleled capabilities of probing quantum many-body states, by obtaining snapshots of the many-body wave function via collective projective measurements. The probability distribution obtained by such snapshots (which are fundamentally limited to a negligible fraction of the Hilbert space) is of fundamental importance to determine the power of quantum computations. However, its relation to many-body collective properties is poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to link quantum phases of matter to their snapshots, based on a combination of data complexity and network theory analyses. The first step in our scheme consists of applying Occam's razor principle to quantum sampling: given snapshots of a wave function, we identify a minimal-complexity measurement basis by analyzing the information compressibility of snapshots over different measurement bases. The second step consists of analyzing arbitrary correlations using network theory, building a wave-function network from the minimal-complexity basis data. This approach allows us to stochastically classify the output of quantum computers and simulations, with no assumptions on the underlying dynamics, and in a fully interpretable manner. We apply this method to quantum states of matter in one-dimensional translational invariant systems, where such classification is exhaustive, and where it reveals an interesting interplay between algorithmic and computational complexity for many-body states. Our framework is of immediate experimental relevance, and can be further extended both in terms of more advanced network mathematics, including discrete homology, as well as in terms of applications to physical phenomena, such as time-dependent dynamics and gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>The $O(N)$ Free-Scalar and Wilson-Fisher Conformal Field Theories on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy-sphere regularization is an emerging numerical and theoretical technique for studying conformal field theories (CFTs). In this paper, we apply it to the $O(N)$ vector model, one of the most prominent theories for critical behavior in three space-time dimensions. We construct a model that realizes the $O(N)$ Wilson-Fisher and free-scalar CFTs for general $N$. For $N=2,3,4$, we present numerical evidence including the operator spectra and correlation functions in agreement with conformal symmetry and conformal bootstrap results.</description>

      <title>Deterministic construction of typical networks in network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often desirable to assess how well a given dataset is described by a given model. In network science, for instance, one often wants to say that a given real-world network appears to come from a particular network model. In statistical physics, the corresponding problem is about how typical a given state, representing real-world data, is in a particular statistical ensemble. One way to address this problem is to measure the distance between the data and the most typical state in the ensemble. Here, we identify the conditions that allow us to define this most typical state. These conditions hold in a wide class of grand canonical ensembles and their random mixtures. Our main contribution is a deterministic construction of a state that converges to this most typical state in the thermodynamic limit. This construction involves rounds of derandomization procedures, some of which deal with derandomizing point processes, an uncharted territory. We illustrate the construction on one particular network model, deterministic hyperbolic graphs, and its application to real-world networks, many of which we find are close to the most typical network in the model. While our main focus is on network models, our results are very general and apply to any grand canonical ensembles and their random mixtures satisfying certain niceness requirements.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian Transition Probability and Correlation Kernel of TASEP in Half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the transition probability for the asymmetric simple exclusion process on the half-space for general initial conditions and particle insertion at the boundary. In the limit of total asymmetry, where particles only jump to the right, we show that the transition probability reduces to a single Pfaffian for a large class of initial conditions. We further derive a Fredholm Pfaffian formula for the multipoint distribution of the totally asymmetric model conditioned on the number of particles in the system using a connection with a Pfaffian point process supported on Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Random Phase Approximation from Projective Truncation Approximation Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the self-consistent random phase approximations (sc-RPA) from the projective truncation approximation (PTA) for the equation of motion of two-time Green's function. The obtained sc-RPA applies to arbitrary temperature and recovers the Rowe's formalism at zero temperature. The PTA formalism not only rationalize Rowe's formula, but also provides a general framework to extend sc-RPA. We implement the sc-RPA calculation for the one-dimensional spinless fermion model in the parameter regime of disordered ground state, with the N-representability constraints enforced. The obtained ground state energy, correlation function, and density spectral function agree well with existing results. The features of the Luttinger liquid ground state and the continuum/bound state in the spectral function are well captured. We discuss several issues concerning the approximations made in RPAs, difficulties of RPA for symmetric state, and the static component problem of PTA.</description>

      <title>Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by sequences of two unitaries: periodic, quasiperiodic and random protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of driving the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using two unitary operators $U_1$ and $U_2$ in different combinations; the unitaries differ in the values of the inter-cell hopping amplitudes. Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $\epsilon$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $\epsilon T$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $\epsilon^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $\epsilon$ and $T$. Finally, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a random order, the $LE$ rapidly decays to zero with increasing time. We have presented a qualitative understanding of the above results.</description>

      <title>Size control guidelines for chemically active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological cells and synthetic analogues use liquid-liquid phase separation to dynamically compartmentalize their environment for various applications. In many cases, multiple droplets need to coexist, and their size needs to be controlled, which is challenging because large droplets tend to grow at the expense of smaller ones. Chemical reactions can, in principle, control droplet sizes, but there are no clear guidelines on how to robustly achieve size control. To provide guidelines, we consider a binary fluid model driven out of equilibrium by chemical reactions. We reveal two different classes of size-controlled droplets, depending on the ratio of droplet radius to the reaction-diffusion length. Moreover, we determine parameter regimes in which droplets become small. Taken together, our theory allows us to separately predict the chemical reactions necessary for maintaining droplets of a given class or size.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of the 2D Hubbard Model via Hilbert Space-Filling Curve Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate tensor network simulations of the two-dimensional Hubbard model by mapping the lattice onto a one-dimensional chain using space-filling curves. In particular, we focus on the Hilbert curve, whose locality-preserving structure minimizes the range of effective interactions in the mapped model. This enables a more compact matrix product state (MPS) representation compared to conventional snake mapping. Through systematic benchmarks, we show that the Hilbert curve consistently yields lower ground-state energies at fixed bond dimension, with the advantage increasing for larger system sizes and in physically relevant interaction regimes. Our implementation reaches clusters up to $32\times32$ sites with open and periodic boundary conditions, delivering reliable ground-state energies and correlation functions in agreement with established results, but at significantly reduced computational cost. These findings establish space-filling curve mappings, particularly the Hilbert curve, as a powerful tool for extending tensor-network studies of strongly correlated two-dimensional quantum systems beyond the limits accessible with standard approaches.</description>

      <title>Stability of quantum chaos against weak non-unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by the repeated action of a non-unitary evolution operator on a system of qubits. Breaking unitarity can lead to the purification of mixed initial states, which corresponds to the loss of sensitivity to initial conditions, and hence the absence of a key signature of dynamical chaos. However, the scrambling of quantum information can delay purification to times that are exponential in system size. Here we study purification in systems whose evolution operators are fixed in time, where all aspects of the dynamics are in principle encoded in spectral properties of the evolution operator for a single time step. The operators that we study consist of global Haar random unitary operators and non-unitary single-qubit operations. We show that exponentially slow purification arises from a distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane that forms a ring with sharp edges at large radii, with the eigenvalue density exponentially large near these edges. We argue that the sharp edges of the eigenvalue distribution arise from level attraction along the radial direction in the complex plane. By calculating the spectral form factor we also show that there is level repulsion around the azimuthal direction, even close to the outer edge of the ring of eigenvalues. Our results connect this spectral signature of quantum chaos to the sensitivity of the system to its initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics and symmetry breaking in generic monitored $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state phases of generic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric monitored, open quantum dynamics. We describe the phases systematically in terms of both information-theoretic diagnostics and spontaneous breaking of strong and weak symmetries of the dynamics. We find a completely broken phase where information is retained by the quantum system, a strong-to-weak broken phase where information is leaked to the environment, and an unbroken phase where information is learned by the observer. We find that weak measurement and dephasing alone constitute a minimal model for generic open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, but we also explore perturbations by unitary gates. For a 1d set of qubits, we examine information-theoretic and symmetry-breaking observables in the path integral of the doubled state. This path integral reduces to the standard classical 2d random-bond Ising model in certain limits but generically involves negative weights, enabling a special self-dual random-bond Ising model at the critical point when only measurements are present. We obtain numerical evidence for the steady-state phases using efficient tensor network simulations of the doubled state.</description>

      <title>Spin conductivity of the XXZ chain in the antiferromagnetic massive regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a series representation for the dynamical two-point function of the local spin current for the XXZ chain in the antiferromagnetic massive regime at zero temperature. From this series we can compute the correlation function with very high accuracy up to very long times and large distances. Each term in the series corresponds to the contribution of all scattering states of an even number of excitations. These excitations can be interpreted in terms of an equal number of particles and holes. The lowest term in the series comprises all scattering states of one hole and one particle. This term determines the long-time large-distance asymptotic behaviour which can be obtained explicitly from a saddle-point analysis. The space-time Fourier transform of the two-point function of currents at zero momentum gives the optical spin conductivity of the model. We obtain highly accurate numerical estimates for this quantity by numerically Fourier transforming our data. For the one-particle, one-hole contribution, equivalently interpreted as a two-spinon contribution, we obtain an exact and explicit expression in terms of known special functions. For large enough anisotropy, the two-spinon contribution carries most of the spectral weight, as can be seen by calculating the f-sum rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two influential exact results in classical one-dimensional diffusive transport are about current statistics for the symmetric simple exclusion process: one in the stationary state on a finite line coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundaries, and the other in the non-stationary state on an infinite line. We present the corresponding result for the intermediate geometry of a semi-infinite line coupled with a single reservoir. This result is obtained using the fluctuating hydrodynamics approach of macroscopic fluctuation theory and confirmed by rare event simulations using a cloning algorithm. We apply our exact result for solving several related challenging problems, namely, the full counting statistics in presence of a defect bond, exclusion process with localized injection, survival of a tagged particle in presence of an absorbing boundary, and the stretched exponential decay in a kinetically constrained model.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the different scaling regimes of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang--Burgers equation using the functional renormalisation group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic equation featuring non-equilibrium scaling. Although in one dimension, its statistical properties are very well understood, a new scaling regime has been reported in recent numerical simulations. This new regime is characterised by a dynamical exponent $z=1$, markedly different from the expected one $z=3/2$ for the KPZ universality class, and it emerges when approaching the inviscid limit. The origin of this scaling has been traced down to the existence of a new fixed point, termed the inviscid Burgers (IB) fixed point, which was uncovered using the functional renormalisation group (FRG). The FRG equations can be solved analytically in the asymptotic regime of vanishing viscosity and large momenta, showing that indeed $z=1$ exactly at the IB fixed point. In this work, we set up an advanced method to numerically solve the full FRG flow equations in a certain approximation, which allows us to determine in a unified way the correlation function over the whole range of momenta, not restricted to some particular regime. We analyse the crossover between the different fixed points, and quantitatively determine the extent of the IB regime.</description>

Abstract: Stressed under a constant load, materials creep with a final acceleration of deformation and for any given applied stress and material, the creep failure time can strongly vary. We investigate creep on sheets of paper and confront the statistics with a simple fiber bundle model of creep failure in a disordered landscape. In the experiments, acoustic emission event times $t_j$ were recorded, and both this data and simulation event series reveal sample-dependent history effects with log-normal statistics and non-Markovian behavior. This leads to a relationship between $t_j$ and the failure time $t_f$ with a power law relationship, evolving with time. These effects and the predictability result from how the energy gap distribution develops during creep.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by ``fracton hydrodynamic" universality classes of dynamics with unusual conservation laws, we present a new dynamical universality class that arises out of local area-preserving dynamics in the non-commutative plane. On this symplectic manifold, the area-preserving spatial symmetry group $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\rtimes \mathbb{R}^2$ is a symmetry group compatible with non-trivial many-body dynamics. The conservation laws associated to this symmetry group correspond to the dipole and quadrupole moments of the particles. We study the unusual dynamics of a crystal lattice subject to such symmetries, and argue that the hydrodynamic description of lattice dynamics breaks down due to relevant nonlinearities. Numerical simulations of classical Hamiltonian dynamical systems with this symmetry are largely consistent with a tree-level effective field theory estimate for the endpoint of this instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the global steady-state distributions of many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems approximately satisfy an analogue of the Boltzmann distribution, with a local dynamical property of states playing the role of energy. The correlation between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the local and global "parts" of the effective potential.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic framework for the thermal conductivity of dense fluids</title>

Abstract: A thermodynamic framework that predicts the thermal conductivity $\lambda$ of simple fluids beyond the dilute-gas limit is introduced. By generalizing the transition-rate approach of particles on a lattice to conserved quantities in continuous space, an expression for the ratio $\lambda/\lambda_{\rm id}$ is derived, where $\lambda_{\rm id}$ is the dilute-gas value; the ratio depends solely on equilibrium thermodynamic properties and is therefore directly computable from any equation of state. The resulting formula quantitatively reproduces simulation data for hard spheres throughout almost the entire fluid range, and captures the behavior of Lennard-Jones fluids in the supercritical region where thermodynamic fluctuations remain moderate. Comparison with experimental data for argon, reported by other authors, also shows good agreement. These results provide evidence that transport coefficients of dense fluids can be expressed as their dilute-gas values multiplied by a universal function of equilibrium thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <title>FuzzifiED : Julia Package for Numerics on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Julia package FuzzifiED aims at simplifying the numerical calculations on the fuzzy sphere. It supports exact diagonalisation (ED) and density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) calculations. FuzzifiED can also apply to generic fermionic and bosonic models. This documentation provides a review of the fuzzy sphere regularisation and an instruction for using FuzzifiED for numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

      <title>Stability of discrete-symmetry flocks: sandwich state, traveling domains and motility-induced pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polar flocks in discrete active systems are often assumed to be robust, yet recent studies reveal their fragility under both imposed and spontaneous fluctuations. Here, we revisit the four-state active Potts model (APM) and show that its globally ordered phase is metastable across a broad swath of parameter space. Small counter-propagating droplets disrupt the flocking phase by inducing a persistent sandwich state, where the droplet-induced opposite-polarity lane remains embedded within the original flock, particularly pronounced at low noise, influenced by spatial anisotropy. In contrast, small transversely propagating droplets, when introduced into the flock, can trigger complete phase reversal due to their alignment orthogonal to the dominant flow and their enhanced persistence. At low diffusion and strong self-propulsion, such transverse droplets also emerge spontaneously, fragmenting the flock into multiple traveling domains and giving rise to a short-range order (SRO) regime. We further identify a motility-induced pinning (MIP) transition in small diffusion and low-temperature regimes when particles of opposite polarity interact, flip their state, hop, and pin an interface. Our comprehensive phase diagrams, encompassing full reversal, sandwich coexistence, stripe bands, SRO, and MIP, delineate how thermal fluctuations, self-propulsion strength, and diffusion govern flock stability in discrete active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Topological Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>
