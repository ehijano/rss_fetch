      <title>Deep Learning based Computer-vision for Enhanced Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting the high data rate demands of modern applications necessitates the utilization of high-frequency spectrum bands, including millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz bands. However, these frequencies require precise alignment of narrow communication beams between transmitters and receivers, typically resulting in significant beam training overhead. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end vision-aided beamforming framework that utilizes images to predict optimal beams while considering geometric adjustments to reduce overhead. Our model demonstrates robust adaptability to dynamic environments without relying on additional training data where the experimental results indicate a top-5 beam prediction accuracy of 98.96%, significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art solutions in vision-aided beamforming.</description>

      <title>Improved Turbo Message Passing for Compressive Robust Principal Component Analysis: Algorithm Design and Asymptotic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressive Robust Principal Component Analysis (CRPCA) naturally arises in various applications as a means to recover a low-rank matrix low-rank matrix $\boldsymbol{L}$ and a sparse matrix $\boldsymbol{S}$ from compressive measurements. In this paper, we approach the problem from a Bayesian inference perspective. We establish a probabilistic model for the problem and develop an improved turbo message passing (ITMP) algorithm based on the sum-product rule and the appropriate approximations. Additionally, we establish a state evolution framework to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the ITMP algorithm in the large-system limit. By analyzing the established state evolution, we further propose sufficient conditions for the global convergence of our algorithm. Our numerical results validate the theoretical results, demonstrating that the proposed asymptotic framework accurately characterize the dynamical behavior of the ITMP algorithm, and the phase transition curve specified by the sufficient condition agrees well with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>WMMSE-Based Joint Transceiver Design for Multi-RIS Assisted Cell-free Networks Using Hybrid CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider cell-free communication systems with several access points (APs) serving terrestrial users (UEs) simultaneously. To enhance the uplink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output communications, we adopt a hybrid-CSI-based two-layer distributed multi-user detection scheme comprising the local minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detection at APs and the one-shot weighted combining at the central processing unit (CPU). Furthermore, to improve the propagation environment, we introduce multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to assist the transmissions from UEs to APs. Aiming to maximize the weighted sum rate, we formulate the weighted sum-MMSE (WMMSE) problem, where the UEs' beamforming matrices, the CPU's weighted combining matrix, and the RISs' phase-shifting matrices are alternately optimized. Considering the limited fronthaul capacity constraint in cell-free networks, we resort to the operator-valued free probability theory to derive the asymptotic alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the WMMSE problem, which only depends on long-term channel statistics and thus reduces the interaction overhead. Numerical results demonstrate that the asymptotic AO algorithm can achieve a high communication rate as well as reduce the interaction overhead.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Personalized Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) unifies communication and model aggregation by leveraging the inherent superposition property of the wireless medium. This strategy can enable scalable and bandwidth-efficient learning via simultaneous transmission of model updates using the same frequency resources, if care is exercised to design the physical layer jointly with learning. In this paper, a federated learning system facilitated by a heterogeneous edge-intelligent network is considered. The edge users (clients) have differing user resources and non-i.i.d. local dataset distributions. A general non-convex learning objective is considered for the model training task(s) at hand. We augment the network with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in order to enhance the learning system. We propose a cross-layer algorithm that jointly assigns communication, computation and learning resources. In particular, we adaptively adjust the number of local steps in conjunction with RIS configuration to boost the learning performance. Our system model considers channel noise and channel estimation errors in both the uplink (model updates) and downlink (global model broadcast), employing dynamic power control for both. We provide the convergence analysis for the proposed algorithms and extend the frameworks to personalized learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art joint communication and learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multiple Correlated Networks for Exact Community Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple correlated networks, focusing on edge-correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Recent work of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022) determined the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using two correlated graphs; in particular, this showcased the subtle interplay between community recovery and graph matching. Here we study the natural setting of more than two graphs. The main challenge lies in understanding how to aggregate information across several graphs when none of the pairwise latent vertex correspondences can be exactly recovered. Our main result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using any constant number of correlated graphs, answering a question of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022). In particular, for every $K \geq 3$ we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact community recovery is possible using $K$ correlated graphs, even though (1) this is information-theoretically impossible using any $K-1$ of them and (2) none of the latent matchings can be exactly recovered.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03101v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Age of Incorrect Information With Hybrid ARQ Under a Resource Constraint for N-ary Symmetric Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) is a recently proposed metric for real-time remote monitoring systems. In particular, AoII measures the time the information at the monitor is incorrect, weighted by the magnitude of this incorrectness, thereby combining the notions of freshness and distortion. This paper addresses the definition of an AoII-optimal transmission policy in a discrete-time communication scheme with a resource constraint and a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocol. Considering an $N$-ary symmetric Markov source, the problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon average-cost constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Interestingly, it is proved that, under some conditions, the optimal transmission policy is to never transmit. This reveals a region of the source dynamics where communication is inadequate in reducing the AoII. Elsewhere, there exists an optimal transmission policy, which is a randomized mixture of two discrete threshold-based policies that randomize on at most one state. The optimal threshold and the randomization component are derived analytically. Numerical results illustrate the impact of the source dynamics, channel conditions, and resource constraints on the average AoII.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01491v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Codes considered as structures within unit schemes greatly extends the availability of linear block and convolutional codes and allows the construction of these codes to required length, rate, distance and type. Properties of a code emanate from properties of the unit from which it was derived. %% can thus be constructed and analysed by designating the units whose properties would give the required codes. Orthogonal units, units in group rings, Fourier/Vandermonde units and related units are used to construct and analyse linear block and convolutional codes and to construct these to predefined length, rate, distance and type. Self-dual, dual containing, quantum error-correcting and linear complementary dual codes are constructed for both linear block and convolutional codes. Low density parity check linear block and convolutional codes are constructed with no short cycles in the control matrix.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Coding Over Coupon Collector Channels for Combinatorial Motif-Based DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding information in combinations of pre-synthesised deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strands (referred to as motifs) is an interesting approach to DNA storage that could potentially circumvent the prohibitive costs of nucleotide-by-nucleotide DNA synthesis. Based on our analysis of an empirical data set from HelixWorks, we propose two channel models for this setup (with and without interference) and analyse their fundamental limits. We propose a coding scheme that approaches those limits by leveraging all information available at the output of the channel, in contrast to earlier schemes developed for a similar setup by Preuss et al. We highlight an important connection between channel capacity curves and the fundamental trade-off between synthesis (writing) and sequencing (reading), and offer a way to mitigate an exponential growth in decoding complexity with the size of the motif library.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining wireless communication with large artificial intelligence (AI) models can open up a myriad of novel application scenarios. In sixth generation (6G) networks, ubiquitous communication and computing resources allow large AI models to serve democratic large AI models-related services to enable real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, the security considerations and sustainable communication resources limit the deployment of large AI models over distributed wireless networks. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of privacy, security, and trustworthy for distributed wireless large AI model (WLAM). In particular, a detailed privacy and security are analysis for distributed WLAM is fist revealed. The classifications and theoretical findings about privacy and security in distributed WLAM are discussed. Then the trustworthy and ethics for implementing distributed WLAM are described. Finally, the comprehensive applications of distributed WLAM are presented in the context of electromagnetic signal processing.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Diversity: The Axiomatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book brings new mathematical rigour to the ongoing vigorous debate on how to quantify biological diversity. The question "what is diversity?" has surprising mathematical depth, and breadth too: this book involves parts of mathematics ranging from information theory, functional equations and probability theory to category theory, geometric measure theory and number theory. It applies the power of the axiomatic method to a biological problem of pressing concern, but the new concepts and theorems are also motivated from a purely mathematical perspective.
  The main narrative thread requires no more than an undergraduate course in analysis. No familiarity with entropy or diversity is assumed.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, achieving up to +0.29 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement at block error rate (BLER) = 0.35 in non-rainy and +0.25 at BLER = 0.2 in rainy conditions, ensuring superior visual quality compared to standard video coding (VC) methods across various conditions.</description>

      <title>DISCO-Dynamic Interference Suppression for Radar and Communication Cohabitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the joint dynamic power allocation and multi-relay selection for the cohabitation of high-priority military radar and low-priority commercial 5G communication. To improve the 5G network performance, we design the full-duplex underlay cognitive radio network for the low-priority commercial 5G network, where multiple relays are selected for concurrently receive the signal from the source and send it to the destination. Then, we propose the interference suppression at the high-priority radar system by using both non-coherent and coherent relay cases. In particular, we formulate the optimization problem for maximizing the system rate, with the consideration of the power constraints at the 5G users and the interference constraint at the radar system. Then, we propose the mathematical analysis model to evaluate the rate performance, considering the impacts of self-interference at the relays and derive the algorithms of joint power allocation and relay selection. Our numerical results demonstrate the characteristic of the optimal configuration and the significant performance gain of coherent case with respect to the non-coherent case and the existing algorithms with single relay selections.</description>
