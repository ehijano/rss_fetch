      <title>Simplicity of $*$-algebras of non-Hausdorff $\mathbb{Z}_2$-multispinal groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study simplicity of $C^*$-algebras arising from self-similar groups of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-multispinal type, a generalization of the Grigorchuk case whose simplicity was first proved by L. Clark, R. Exel, E. Pardo, C. Starling, and A. Sims in 2019, and we prove results generalizing theirs. Our first main result is a sufficient condition for simplicity of the Steinberg algebra satisfying conditions modeled on the behavior of the groupoid associated to the first Grigorchuk group. This closely resembles conditions found by B. Steinberg and N. Szak\'acs. As a key ingredient we identify an infinite family of $2-(2q-1,q-1,q/2-1)$-designs, where $q$ is a positive even integer. We then deduce the simplicity of the associated $C^*$-algebra, which is our second main result. Results of similar type were considered by B. Steinberg and N. Szak\'acs in 2021, and later by K. Yoshida, but their methods did not follow the original methods of the five authors.</description>

      <title>Capacities of quantum Markovian noise for large times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a quantum Markovian noise model, we study the maximum dimension of a classical or quantum system that can be stored for arbitrarily large time. We show that, unlike the fixed time setting, in the limit of infinite time, the classical and quantum capacities are characterized by efficiently computable properties of the peripheral spectrum of the quantum channel. In addition, the capacities are additive under tensor product, which implies in the language of Shannon theory that the one-shot and the asymptotic i.i.d. capacities are the same. We also provide an improved algorithm for computing the structure of the peripheral subspace of a quantum channel, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>New combinatorial identity for the set of partitions and limit theorems in finite free probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a refined combinatorial identity for the set of partitions of $\{1,\dots, n\}$, which plays an important role in investigating several limit theorems related to finite free convolutions. Firstly, we present the finite free analogue of Sakuma and Yoshida's limit theorem. That is, we provide the limit of $\{D_{1/m}((p_d^{\boxtimes_d m})^{\boxplus_d m})\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}}$ as $m\rightarrow\infty$ in two cases: (i) $m/d\rightarrow t$ for some $t&gt;0$, or (ii) $m/d\rightarrow0$. The second application presents a central limit theorem for finite free multiplicative convolution. We establish a connection between this theorem and the multiplicative free semicircular distributions through combinatorial identities. Our last result gives alternative proofs for Kabluchko's limit theorems concerning the unitary Hermite and the Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>Operators commuting with complex symmetric weighted composition operators on $H^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initially study when an anti-linear Toeplitz operator is in the commutant of a composition operator. Primarily, we investigate weighted composition operators $W_{g,\psi}$ commuting with complex symmetric weighted composition operators $W_{f,\varphi}$ on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$. In particular, we give the descriptions of the symbols $g$ and $\psi$ such that the inducing weighted composition operator $W_{g,\psi}$ commutes with the complex symmetric weighted composition operator $W_{f,\varphi}$ with the conjugation $\mathcal{J}$. Furthermore, we subsequently demonstrate that these weighted composition operators are normal and complex symmetric in accordance with the properties of the fixed point of the associated symbol $\varphi$.</description>
