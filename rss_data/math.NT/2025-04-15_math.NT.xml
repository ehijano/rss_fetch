      <title>Carmichael Numbers in All Possible Arithmetic Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every arithmetic progression either contains infinitely many Carmichael numbers or none at all. Furthermore, there is a simple criterion for determining which category a given arithmetic progression falls into. In particular, if $m$ is any integer such that $(m,2\phi(m))=1$ then there exist infinitely many Carmichael numbers divisible by $m$. As a consequence, we are able to prove that $\liminf_{n\text{ Carmichael}}\frac{\phi(n)}{n}=0$, resolving a question of Alford, Granville, and Pomerance.</description>

      <title>Counting integral points near space curves: an elementary approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish upper and lower bounds for the number of integral points which lie within a neighbourhood of a smooth nondegenerate curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 3$. These estimates are new for $n\geq 4$, and we recover an earlier result of J. J. Huang for $n=3$. However, we do so by using Fourier analytic techniques which, in contrast with the method of Huang, do not require the sharp counting result for planar curves as an input. In particular, we rely on an Arkhipov--Chubarikov--Karatsuba-type oscillatory integral estimate.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory and the representations of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, I develop a representation-theoretic refinement of the Iwasawa theory of finite Cayley graphs. Building on analogies between graph zeta functions and number-theoretic L-functions, I study $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-towers of Cayley graphs and the asymptotic growth of their Jacobians. My main result establishes that the Iwasawa polynomial associated to such a tower admits a canonical factorization indexed by the irreducible representations of the underlying group. This leads to the definition of representation-theoretic Iwasawa polynomials, whose properties are studied.</description>

      <title>Diamond diagrams and multivariable $(\varphi,\mathcal{O}_K^{\times})$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $K$ a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Let $\pi$ be an admissible smooth mod $p$ representation of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ occurring in some Hecke eigenspaces of the mod $p$ cohomology and $\overline{r}$ be its underlying global two-dimensional Galois representation. When $\overline{r}$ satisfies some Taylor-Wiles hypotheses and is sufficiently generic at $p$, we compute explicitly certain constants appearing in the diagram associated to $\pi$, generalizing the results of Dotto-Le. As a result, we prove that the associated \'etale $(\varphi,\mathcal{O}_K^{\times})$-module $D_A(\pi)$ defined by Breuil-Herzig-Hu-Morra-Schraen is explicitly determined by the restriction of $\overline{r}$ to the decomposition group at $p$, generalizing the results of Breuil-Herzig-Hu-Morra-Schraen and the author.</description>

      <title>Direct and Inverse Problems for Restricted Signed Sumsets -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A=\{a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\}$ be a nonempty finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$. For a positive integer $h$, the $h$-fold signed sumset of $A$, denoted by $h_{\pm}A$, is defined as $$h_{\pm}A=\left\lbrace \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_{i} a_{i}: \lambda_{i} \in \{-h, \ldots, 0, \ldots, h\} \ \text{for} \ i= 1, 2, \ldots, k \ \text{and} \ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left|\lambda_{i} \right| =h\right\rbrace,$$ and the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset of $A$, denoted by $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$, is defined as $$h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A=\left\lbrace \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_{i} a_{i}: \lambda_{i} \in \left\lbrace -1, 0, 1\right\rbrace \ \text{for} \ i= 1, 2, \ldots, k \ \text{and} \ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left|\lambda_{i} \right| = h\right\rbrace. $$ A direct problem for the sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ is to find the optimal size of $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ in terms of $h$ and $|A|$. An inverse problem for this sumset is to determine the structure of the underlying set $A$ when the sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ has optimal size. While some results are known for the signed sumsets in finite abelian groups due to Bajnok and Matzke, not much is known for the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ even in the additive group of integers $\Bbb Z$. In case of $G = \Bbb Z$, Bhanja, Komatsu and Pandey studied these problems for the sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ for $h=2, 3$, and $k$, and conjectured the direct and inverse results for $h \geq 4$. In this paper, we prove these conjectures completely for the sets of positive integers. In a subsequent paper, we prove these conjectures for the sets of nonnegative integers.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff measure and Fourier dimensions of limsup sets arising in weighted and multiplicative Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Khintchine--Jarn\'ik Theorem provides elegant criteria for determining the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff measure of sets of points approximated by rational points, which has inspired much modern research in metric Diophantine approximation. This paper concerns the Lebesgue measure, Hausdorff measure and Fourier dimension of sets arising in weighted and multiplicative Diophantine approximation.
  We provide zero-full laws for determining the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff measure of the sets under consideration. In particular, the criterion for the weighted setup refines a dimensional result given by Li, Liao, Velani, Wang, and Zorin [arXiv: 2410.18578 (2024)], while the criteria for the multiplicative setup answer a question raised by Hussain and Simmons [J. Number Theory (2018)] and extend beyond it. A crucial observation is that, even in higher dimensions, both setups are more appropriately understood as consequences of the `balls-to-rectangles' mass transference principle.
  We also determine the exact Fourier dimensions of these sets. The result we obtain indicates that, in line with the existence results, these sets are generally non-Salem sets, except in the one-dimensional case. This phenomenon can be partly explained by another result of this paper, which states that the Fourier dimension of the product of two sets equals the minimum of their respective Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>Galois groups of reductions modulo p of D-finite series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the algebraicity behavior of reductions of $D$-finite power series modulo prime numbers. For many classes of D-finite functions, such as diagonals of multivariate algebraic series or hypergeometric functions, it is known that their reductions modulo prime numbers, when defined, are algebraic. We formulate a conjecture that uniformizes the Galois groups of these reductions across different prime numbers. We then focus on hypergeometric functions, which serves as a test case for our conjecture. Refining the construction of an annihilating polynomial for the reduction of a hypergeometric function modulo a prime number p, we extract information on the respective Galois groups and show that they behave nicely as p varies.</description>

      <title>Counting ideals in abelian number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Already Dedekind and Weber considered the problem of counting integral ideals of norm at most $x$ in a given number field $K$. Here we improve on the existing results in case $K/\mathbb Q$ is abelian and has degree at least four. For these fields, we obtain as a consequence an improvement of the available results on counting pairs of coprime ideals each having norm at most $x$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative growth of linear recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{u_n\}_n$ be a non-degenerate linear recurrence sequence of integers with Binet's formula given by $u_n= \sum_{i=1}^{m} P_i(n)\alpha_i^n.$ Assume $\max_i \vert \alpha_i \vert &gt;1$. In 1977, Loxton and Van der Poorten conjectured that for any $\epsilon &gt;0$ there is a effectively computable constant $C(\epsilon),$ such that if $ \vert u_n \vert &lt; (\max_i\{ \vert \alpha_i \vert \})^{n(1-\epsilon)}$, then $n&lt;C(\epsilon)$. Using results of Schmidt and Evertse, a complete non-effective (qualitative) proof of this conjecture was given by Fuchs and Heintze (2021) and, independently, by Karimov and al.~(2023). In this paper, we give an effective upper bound for the number of solutions of the inequality $\vert u_n \vert &lt; (\max_i\{ \vert \alpha_i \vert \})^{n(1-\epsilon)}$, thus extending several earlier results by Schmidt, Schlickewei and Van der Poorten.</description>

      <title>Hasse-Arf property and abelian extensions for local fields with imperfect residue fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite totally ramified extension $L$ of a complete discrete valuation field $K$ with the perfect residue field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, it is known that $L/K$ is an abelian extension if the upper ramification breaks are integers and if the wild inertia group is abelian. We prove a similar result without the assumption that the residue field is perfect. As an application, we prove a converse to the Hasse-Arf theorem for a complete discrete valuation field with the imperfect residue field. More precisely, for a complete discrete valuation field $K$ with the residue field $\overline{K}$ of residue characteristic $p&gt;2$ and a finite non-abelian Galois extension $L/K$ such that the Galois group of $L/K$ is equal to the inertia group $I$ of $L/K$, we construct a complete discrete valuation field $K'$ with the residue field $\overline{K}$ and a finite Galois extension $L'/K'$ which has at least one non-integral upper ramification break and whose Galois group and inertia group are isomorphic to $I$.</description>

      <title>Resolving Adenwalla's conjecture related to a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham about covering systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham posed the question of whether there exists an integer $n$ such that the divisors of $n$ greater than $1$ form a distinct covering system with pairwise coprime moduli for overlapping congruences. Adenwalla recently proved no such $n$ exists, introducing the concept of nice integers, those for which such a system exists without necessarily covering all integers. Moreover, Adenwalla established a necessary condition for nice integers: if $n$ is nice and $p$ is its smallest prime divisor, then $n/p$ must have fewer than $p$ distinct prime factors. Adenwalla conjectured this condition is also sufficient. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture affirmatively by developing a novel constructive framework for residue assignments. Utilizing a hierarchical application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we demonstrate that every integer satisfying the condition indeed admits a good set of congruences. Our result completes the characterization of nice integers, resolving an interesting open problem in combinatorial number theory.</description>

      <title>Direct and Inverse Problems for Restricted Signed Sumsets -- II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A=\{a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\}$ be a nonempty finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$. For a positive integer $h$, the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset of $A$, denoted by $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$, is defined as $$h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A = \left\lbrace \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_{i} a_{i}: \lambda_{i} \in \left\lbrace -1, 0, 1\right\rbrace \ \text{for} \ i= 1, 2, \ldots, k \ \text{and} \ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left|\lambda_{i} \right| =h\right\rbrace. $$ A direct problem for the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset is to find the optimal size of $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ in terms of $h$ and $|A|$. An inverse problem for this sumset is to determine the structure of the underlying set $A$ when the sumset has optimal size. While the signed sumsets (which is defined differently compared to the restricted signed sumset) in finite abelian groups has been investigated by Bajnok and Matzke, the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ is not well studied even in the additive group of integers $\Bbb Z$. Bhanja, Komatsu and Pandey studied these problems for the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset for $h=2, 3$, and $k$, and conjectured some direct and inverse results for $h \geq 4$. In a recent paper, Mistri and Prajapati proved these conjectures completely for the set of positive integers. In this paper, we prove these conjectures for the set of nonnegative integers, which settles all the conjectures completely.</description>

      <title>On relative fields of definition for log pairs, Vojta's height inequalities and asymptotic coordinate size dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on the perspective of the works \cite{Grieve:Noytaptim:fwd:orbits}, \cite{Matsuzawa:2023}, \cite{Grieve:qualitative:subspace}, \cite{Grieve:chow:approx}, \cite{Grieve:Divisorial:Instab:Vojta} (and others) and study the dynamical arithmetic complexity of rational points in projective varieties. Our main results make progress towards the attractive problem of asymptotic complexity of coordinate size dynamics in the sense formulated by Matsuzawa, in \cite[Question 1.1.2]{Matsuzawa:2023}, and building on earlier work of Silverman \cite{Silverman:1993}. A key tool to our approach here is a novel formulation of conjectural Vojta type inequalities for log canonical pairs and with respect to finite extensions of number fields. Among other features, these conjectured Diophantine arithmetic height inequalities raise the question of existence of log resolutions with respect to finite extensions of number fields which is another novel concept which we formulate in precise terms here and also which is of an independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the $N$th $2$-adic complexity of binary sequences identified with algebraic $2$-adic integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a binary sequence $\mathcal{S}=(s_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ with the $2$-adic integer $G_\mathcal{S}(2)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty s_n2^n$. In the case that $G_\mathcal{S}(2)$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ of degree $d\ge 2$, we prove that the $N$th $2$-adic complexity of $\mathcal{S}$ is at least $\frac{N}{d}+O(1)$, where the implied constant depends only on the minimal polynomial of $G_\mathcal{S}(2)$. This result is an analog of the bound of M\'erai and the second author on the linear complexity of automatic sequences, that is, sequences with algebraic $G_\mathcal{S}(X)$ over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_2(X)$. We further discuss the most important case $d=2$ in both settings and explain that the intersection of the set of $2$-adic algebraic sequences and the set of automatic sequences is the set of (eventually) periodic sequences. Finally, we provide some experimental results supporting the conjecture that $2$-adic algebraic sequences can have also a desirable $N$th linear complexity and automatic sequences a desirable $N$th $2$-adic complexity, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the mean value of $\mathrm{GL}_1$ and $\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions, with applications to murmurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the mean value of $L$-functions attached to quadratic twists of automorphic representations on $\mathrm{GL}_1$ or $\mathrm{GL}_2$ in large regions of the critical strip. In the case of $\mathrm{GL}_1$, we go on to exhibit a recently discovered type of fine structure called "murmurations" unconditionally for all of our families. Our main tool is a new variant of the approximate functional equation imbued with a mechanism for dynamically rebalancing error terms while preserving holomorphicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A=\{a_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ and $B=\{b_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be two sequences of positive integers. Under some restrictions on $A$ and $B$, we obtain a lower bound for a number of integers $n$ not exceeding $x$ that can be expressed as a sum $n = a_i + b_j$. In particular, we obtain the result in the case when $A$ is the set of numbers representable as the sum of two squares.</description>

Abstract: Let $k\ge 2$ and $\{F_n^{(k)}\}_{n\geq 2-k}$ be the sequence of $k$--generalized Fibonacci numbers whose first $k$ terms are $0,\ldots,0,0,1$ and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding $k$ terms.

      <description>arXiv:2504.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $X$ a hyperbolic curve of genus $g$ with good reduction at $p\geq 2g$, we give an explicit bound on the Mordell--Lang locus $X(\mathbb{C})\cap \Gamma $, when $\Gamma \subset J(\mathbb{C})$ is the divisible hull of a subgroup of $J(\mathbb{Q} _p ^{\mathrm{nr}})$ of rank less than $g$. Without any assumptions on the rank (but with all the other assumptions) we show that $X(\mathbb{C})\cap \Gamma $ is unramified at $p$, and bound the size of its image in $X(\overline{\mathbb{F} }_p )$. As a corollary, we show that Mordell implies Mordell--Lang for curves.</description>

      <title>On additive irreducibility of multiplicative subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a version of Stepanov's method developed by Hanson and Petridis to prove several results on additive irreducibility of multiplicative subgroups in $\mathbb F_p$. We prove that if for a subgroup $\mu_d$ of $d-$th roots of unity we have $A-A=\mu_d\cup\{0\}$, then $d=2$ or $6$. We also establish the truth of S\'ark\"ozy's conjecture on quadratic residues: for all primes $p$ the set $\mathcal R_p$ of quadratic residues modulo $p$ cannot be represented as $A+B$ for sets $A,B$ with $\min(|A|,|B|)&gt;1$. In a more general setting, we prove that if $d-$th roots of unity $\mu_d$ are represented non-trivially as $A+B$, then the sizes of summands are equal.</description>

      <title>Digits of pi: limits to the seeming randomness II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to a popular belief, the decimal digits of mathematical constants such as {\pi} behave like statistically independent random variables, each taking the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 with equal probability of 1/10. If this is the case, then, in particular, the decimal representations of these constants should tend to satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). The paper presents the results of a direct statistical analysis of the decimal representations of 12 mathematical constants with respect to the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). The first billion digits of each constant were analyzed, with ten billion digits examined in the case of {\pi}. Within these limits, no evidence was found to suggest that the digits of these constants satisfy CLT or LIL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate ortho-integral (OI) hyperbolic surfaces with totally geodesic boundaries, defined by the property that every orthogeodesic (i.e. a geodesic arc meeting the boundary perpendicularly at both endpoints) has an integer cosh-length. We prove that while only finitely many OI surfaces exist for any fixed topology, infinitely many commensurability classes arise as the topology varies. Moreover, we completely classify OI pants and OI one-holed tori, and show that their doubles are arithmetic surfaces of genus 2 derived from quaternion algebras over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>The diagonal and Hadamard grade of hypergeometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagonals of rational functions are an important class of functions arising in number theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and physics. In this paper we study the diagonal grade of a function $f$, which is defined to be the smallest $n$ such that $f$ is the diagonal of a rational function in variables $x_0,\dots, x_n$. We relate the diagonal grade of a function to the nilpotence of the associated differential equation. This allows us to determine the diagonal grade of many hypergeometric functions and answer affirmatively the outstanding question on the existence of functions with diagonal grade greater than $2$. In particular, we show that $\prescript{}{n}F_{n-1}(\frac{1}{2},\dots, \frac{1}{2};1\dots,1 \mid x)$ has diagonal grade $n$ for each $n\geq 1$. Our method also applies to the generating function of the Ap\'ery sequence, which we find to have diagonal grade $3$. We also answer related questions on Hadamard grades posed by Allouche and Mend\`es France. For example, we show that $\prescript{}{n}F_{n-1}(\frac{1}{2},\dots, \frac{1}{2};1\dots,1 \mid x)$ has Hadamard grade $n$ for all $n\geq 1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop general machinery for computing the classifying ring $L^A$ of one-dimensional formal $A$-modules, for various commutative rings $A$. We then apply the machinery to obtain calculations of $L^A$ for various number rings and cyclic group rings $A$. This includes the first full calculations of the ring $L^A$ in cases in which it fails to be a polynomial algebra. We also derive consequences for the solvability of some lifting and extension problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1805.03611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a refined version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for abelian varieties over global function fields. This refinement incorporates both families of congruences between the leading terms of Artin-Hasse-Weil $L$-series and also strong restrictions on the Galois structure of natural Selmer complexes and constitutes a precise analogue for abelian varieties over function fields of the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture for abelian varieties over number fields. We then provide strong supporting evidence for this conjecture including giving a full proof, modulo only the assumed finiteness of Tate-Shafarevich groups, in an important class of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the algebraic study of contextuality in quantum theory. As an algebraic analogue of Kochen and Specker's no-hidden-variables result, we investigate rational subrings over which the partial ring of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices ($d \geq 3$) admits no morphism to a commutative ring, which we view as an "algebraic hidden state." For $d = 3$, the minimal such ring is shown to be $\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$, while for $d \geq 6$ the minimal subring is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. The proofs rely on the construction of new sets of integer vectors in dimensions 3 and 6 that have no Kochen-Specker coloring.</description>

Abstract: We use higher Coleman theory to construct a new $p$-adic $L$-function for $\text{GSp}_4 \times \text{GL}_2$. While previous works by the first author, Pilloni, Skinner and Zerbes had considered the $p$-adic variation of classes in the $H^2$ of Shimura varieties for $\text{GSp}_4$, in this note we explore the interpolation of classes in the $H^1$, which allows us to access to a different range of weights. Further, we show an interpolation property in terms of complex $L$-values using the algebraicity results established in previous work by the authors.</description>

      <title>A high-codimensional Yuan's inequality and its application to higher arithmetic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a dominant rational self-map $f:X \dashrightarrow X$ of a normal projective variety defined over a number field. We study the arithmetic degree $\alpha_k(f)$ for $f$ and $\alpha_k(f,V)$ of a subvariety $V$, which generalize the classical arithmetic degree $\alpha_1(f,P)$ of a point $P$. We generalize Yuan's arithmetic version of Siu's inequality to higher codimensions and utilize it to demonstrate the existence of the arithmetic degree $\alpha_k(f)$. Furthermore, we establish the relative degree formula $\alpha_k(f)=\max\{\lambda_k(f),\lambda_{k-1}(f)\}$. In addition, we prove several basic properties of the arithmetic degree $\alpha_k(f, V)$ and establish the upper bound $\overline{\alpha}_{k+1}(f, V)\leq \max\{\lambda_{k+1}(f),\lambda_{k}(f)\}$, which generalizes the classical result $\overline{\alpha}_f(P)\leq \lambda_1(f)$. Finally, we discuss a generalized version of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture that was proposed by Dang et al, and we provide a counterexample to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Uniform bounds for Kloosterman sums of half-integral weight, same-sign case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous paper [Sun23], the author proved a uniform bound for sums of half-integral weight Kloosterman sums. This bound was applied to prove an exact formula for partitions of rank modulo 3. That uniform estimate provides a more precise bound for a certain class of multipliers compared to the 1983 result by Goldfeld and Sarnak and generalizes the 2009 result from Sarnak and Tsimerman to the half-integral weight case. However, the author only considered the case when the parameters satisfied $\tilde m\tilde n&lt;0$. In this paper, we prove the same uniform bound when $\tilde m\tilde n&gt;0$ for further applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a method of evaluating general exponential sums with rational amplitude functions for multiple variables which complements works by T. Cochrane and Z. Zheng on the single variable case. As an application, for $n\geq 2$, a fixed natural number, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the (weighted) number of solutions of quadratic congruences of the form $x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2\equiv x_{n+1}^2\bmod{p^m}$ in small boxes, thus establishing an equidistribution result for these solutions.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras for the shuffle algebra and fractions from multiple zeta values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebra of multiple zeta values (MZVs) is encoded as a stuffle (quasi-shuffle) algebra and a shuffle algebra. The MZV stuffle algebra has a natural Hopf algebra structure. This paper equips a Hopf algebra structure to the MZV shuffle algebra. The needed coproduct is defined by a recursion through a family of weight-increasing linear operators. To verify the Hopf algebra axioms, we make use of a family of fractions, called Chen fractions, that have been used to study MZVs and also serve as the function model for the MZV shuffle algebra. Applying natural derivations on functions and working in the context of locality, a locality Hopf algebra structure is established on the linear span of Chen fractions. This locality Hopf algebra is then shown to descend to a Hopf algebra on the MZV shuffle algebra, whose coproduct satisfies the same recursion as the first-defined coproduct. Thus the two coproducts coincide, establishing the needed Hopf algebra axioms on the MZV shuffle algebra.</description>

      <title>First-order definability of affine Campana points in the projective line over a number field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer a $\forall\exists$-definition for (affine) Campana points over $\mathbb{P}^1_K$ (where $K$ is a number field), which constitute a set-theoretical filtration between $K$ and $\mathcal{O}_{K,S}$ ($S$-integers), which are well-known to be universally defined (Koenigsmann 2010, Park 2012, Eisentraeger &amp; Morrison 2016). We also show that our formulas are uniform with respect to all possible $S$, are parameter-free as such, and we count the number of involved quantifiers and offer a bound for the degree of the defining polynomial.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to mass transference principle and large intersection property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass transference principle, discovered by Beresnevich and Velani [Ann Math (2), 2006], is a landmark result in Diophantine approximation that allows us to obtain the Hausdorff measure theory of $\limsup$ set. Another important tool is the notion of large intersection property, introduced and systematically studied by Falconer [J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2), 1994]. The former mainly focuses on passing between full (Lebesgue) measure and full Hausdorff measure statements, while the latter transfers full Hausdorff content statement to Hausdorff dimension. From this perspective, the proofs of the two results are quite similar but often treated in different ways.
  In this paper, we establish a general mass transference principle from the viewpoint of Hausdorff content, aiming to provide a unified proof for the aforementioned results. More precisely, this principle allows us to transfer the Hausdorff content bounds of a sequence of open sets $E_n$ to the full Hausdorff measure statement and large intersection property for $\limsup E_n$. One of the advantages of our approach is that the verification of the Hausdorff content bound does not require the construction of Cantor-like subset, resulting in a much simpler proof. As an application, we provide simpler proofs for several mass transference principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal K$ be a field of formal Laurent series with coefficients in a finite field of characteristic $p$. For $M\ge 1$, let $\mathcal G_{&lt;p,M}$ be the maximal quotient of the Galois group of $\mathcal K$ of period $p^M$ and nilpotent class $&lt;p$ and $\{\mathcal G_{&lt;p,M}^{(v)}\}_{v\geqslant 0}$ -- the ramification subgroups in upper numbering. Let $\mathcal G_{&lt;p,M}=G(\mathcal L)$ be the identification of nilpotent Artin-Schreier theory: here $G(\mathcal L)$ is the group obtained from a suitable profinite Lie $\mathbb{Z}/p^M$-algebra $\mathcal L$ via the Campbell-Hausdorff composition law. We develop new techniques to obtain a ``geometrical'' construction of the ideals $\mathcal L^{(v)}$ such that $G(\mathcal L^{(v)})=\mathcal G_{&lt;p,M}^{(v)}$. Given $v_0\geqslant 1$, we construct a decreasing central filtration $\mathcal L(w)$, $1\leqslant w\leqslant p$, on $\mathcal L$, an epimorphism of Lie $\mathbb{Z}/p^M$-algebras $\bar{\mathcal V}:\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }\to \bar{\mathcal L}:=\mathcal L/\mathcal L(p)$, and a unipotent action $\Omega $ of $\mathbb{Z} /p^M$ on $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }$, which induces the identity action on $\bar{\mathcal L}$. Suppose $d\Omega =B^{\dag }$, where $B^{\dag }\in\operatorname{Diff}\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }$, and $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag [v_0]}$ is the ideal of $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }$ generated by the elements of $B^{\dag }(\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag })$. Our main result states that the ramification ideal $\mathcal L^{(v_0)}$ appears as the preimage of the ideal in $\bar{\mathcal L}$ generated by $\bar{\mathcal V}B^{\dag }(\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag [v_0]})$. In the last section we apply this to the explicit construction of generators of $\bar{\mathcal L}^{(v_0)}$. The paper justifies a geometrical origin of ramification subgroups of $\Gamma _K$ and can be used for further developing of non-abelian local class field theory.</description>

Abstract: We establish a representability criterion of $v$-sheaf theoretic modifications of formal schemes and apply this criterion to moduli spaces of parahoric level structures on local shtukas. In the proof, we introduce nice classes of equivariant profinite perfectoid covers and study geometric quotients of perfectoid formal schemes by profinite groups. As a corollary, we obtain a construction of (part of) integral models of local and global Shimura varieties under hyperspecial levels from those at hyperspecial levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is conjectured that for any fixed relatively prime positive integers $a,b$ and $c$ all greater than 1 there is at most one solution to the equation $a^x+b^y=c^z$ in positive integers $x,y$ and $z$, except for specific cases. We develop the methods in our previous work which rely on a variety from Baker's theory and thoroughly study the conjecture for cases where $c$ is small relative to $a$ or $b$. Using restrictions derived under which there is more than one solution to the equation, we obtain a number of finiteness results on the conjecture, which in particular enables us to find some new values of $c$ being presumably infinitely many such that for each such $c$ the conjecture holds true except for only finitely many pairs of $a$ and $b$. Most importantly we prove that if $c=13$ then the equation has at most one solution, except for $(a,b)=(3,10)$ or $(10,3)$ which exactly gives two solutions. Further our study with the help of Schmidt Subspace Theorem among others brings strong contributions to the study of Pillai's type Diophantine equations, which includes a general and satisfactory result on a well-known conjecture of M. Bennett on the equation $a^x-b^y=c$ for any fixed positive integers $a,b$ and $c$ with both $a$ and $b$ greater than 1. Some conditional results are presented under the $abc$-conjecture as well.</description>

      <title>Gaps in the complex Farey sequence of an imaginary quadratic number field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, we are interested in the asymptotic \emph{distance to nearest neighbour} (or \emph{gap}) statistic of complex Farey fractions $\frac{p}{q}$, with $p,q \in \mathcal{O}_K$ and $0&lt;|q|\leq T$, as $T \to \infty$. Reformulating this problem in a homogeneous dynamical setting, we follow the approach of J. Marklof for real Farey fractions with several variables (2013) and adapt a joint equidistribution result in the real $3$-dimensional hyperbolic space of J. Parkkonen and F. Paulin (2023) to derive the existence of a probability measure describing this asymptotic gap statistic. We obtain an integral formula for the associated cumulative distribution function, and use geometric arguments to find an explicit estimate for its tail distribution in the cases of Gaussian and Eisenstein fractions.</description>

      <title>General sharp bounds for the number of solutions to purely exponential equations with three terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is conjectured that for any fixed relatively prime positive integers $a,b$ and $c$ all greater than 1 there is at most one solution to the equation $a^x+b^y=c^z$ in positive integers $x,y$ and $z$, except for specific cases. In this paper, we prove that for any fixed $c$ there is at most one solution to the equation, except for only finitely many pairs of $a$ and $b.$ This is regarded as a 3-variable generalization of the result of Miyazaki and Pink [T. Miyazaki and I. Pink, Number of solutions to a special type of unit equations in two unknowns, III, arXiv:2403.20037 (accepted for publication in Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc.)] which asserts that for any fixed positive integer $a$ there are only finitely many pairs of coprime positive integers $b$ and $c$ with $b&gt;1$ such that the Pillai's type equation $a^x-b^y=c$ has more than one solution in positive integers $x$ and $y$. The proof of our result is based on a certain $p$-adic idea of Miyazaki and Pink and relies on many deep theorems on the theory of Diophantine approximation, and it also includes the complete description of solutions to some interesting system of simultaneous polynomial-exponential equations. We also discuss how effectively exceptional pairs of $a$ and $b$ on our result for each $c$ can be determined.</description>

Abstract: We consider two-parameter generalizations of Hecke-Appell type expansions for the generating functions of unimodal and special unimodal sequences. We then determine their explicit representations which involve mixed false theta functions. These results complement recent striking work of Mortenson and Zwegers on the mixed mock modularity of the generalized $U$-function due to Hikami and Lovejoy. As an application, we demonstrate how to recover classical partial theta function identities which appear in Ramanujan's lost notebook and in work of Warnaar.</description>

      <title>Weil-Barsotti formula for $\mathbf{T}$-modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the work of M. A. Papanikolas and N. Ramachandran [A Weil-Barsotti formula for Drinfeld modules, Journal of Number Theory 98, (2003), 407-431] the Weil-Barsotti formula for the function field case concerning $\Ext_{\tau}^1(E,C)$ where $E$ is a Drinfeld module and $C$ is the Carlitz module was proved. We generalize this formula to the case where $E$ is a strictly pure \tm module $\Phi$ with the zero nilpotent matrix $N_\Phi.$ For such a \tm module $\Phi$ we explicitly compute its dual \tm module ${\Phi}^{\vee}$ as well as its double dual ${\Phi}^{{\vee}{\vee}}.$ This computation is done in a a subtle way by combination of the \tm reduction algorithm developed by F. G{\l}och, D.E. K{\k e}dzierski, P. Kraso{\'n} [ Algorithms for determination of \tm module structures on some extension groups , arXiv:2408.08207] and the methods of the work of D.E. K{\k e}dzierski and P. Kraso{\'n} [On $\Ext^1$ for Drinfeld modules, Journal of Number Theory 256 (2024) 97-135]. We also give a counterexample to the Weil-Barsotti formula if the nilpotent matrix $N_{\Phi}$ is non-zero.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of the partial sums of a random multiplicative function III: Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19845v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V(x)$ be the number of sign changes of the partial sums up to $x$, say $M_f(x)$, of a Rademacher random multiplicative function $f$. We prove that the averaged value of $V(x)$ is at least $\gg (\log x)(\log\log x)^{-1/2-\epsilon}$. Our new method applies for the counting of sign changes of the partial sums of a system of orthogonal random variables having variance $1$ under additional hypothesis on the moments of these partial sums. In particular, we extend to larger classes of dependencies an old result of Erd\H{o}s and Hunt on sign changes of partial sums of i.i.d. random variables. In the arithmetic case, the main input in our method is the ``\textit{linearity}'' phase in $1\leq q\leq 1.9$ of the quantity $\log \mathbb{E} |M_f(x)|^q$, provided by the Harper's \textit{better than squareroot cancellation} phenomenon for small moments of $M_f(x)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalised Fermat equation (GFE) is the equation of the form $ax^p+by^q=cz^r$, where $a,b,c,p,q,r$ are positive integers. If $1/p+1/q+1/r&lt;1$, GFE is known to have at most finitely many primitive integer solutions $(x,y,z)$. A large body of the literature is devoted to finding such solutions explicitly for various six-tuples $(a,b,c,p,q,r)$, as well as for infinite families of such six-tuples. This paper surveys the families of parameters for which GFE has been solved. Although the proofs are not discussed here, collecting these references in one place will make it easier for the readers to find the relevant proof techniques in the original papers. Also, this survey will help the readers to avoid duplicate work by solving the already solved cases.</description>

      <title>On some periodic continued fractions along the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, Brock, Elkies, and Jordan generalized the theory of periodic continued fractions (PCFs) over $\mathbb{Z}$ to the ring of integers in a number field. In particular, they considered the case where the number field is an intermediate field of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ and asked whether a $(N, \ell)$-type PCF for $X_n = 2\cos(2\pi/2^{n+2})$ exists. In this paper, we construct $(1,2)$ and $(0,3)$-type PCFs for $X_n$ for all $n\geq1$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit construction of type (0,3) continued fractions for all $n\geq1$. To obtain such results, for each type, we construct a bijection between a certain subset of the group of relative units in each layer of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-extension and the set of PCFs for $X_n$. While our result confirms the existence of such PCFs for all $n\geq1$ in types $(1,2)$ and $(0,3)$, determining all PCFs remains an open problem. The bijections constructed in our result translate this problem into the study of the subsets of the relative units. As a second main result, we give explicit bounds for the logarithms of the relative units corresponding to $(1,2)$ or $(0,3)$-type PCFs for $X_n$. These bounds allow us to explain interesting phenomena observed in the distribution of such points.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs of degree five for classical orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish a classification theorem for such 5-designs with 6 points. The proof is based on an elementary polynomial identity and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. We then prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of 5-designs with rational points, especially for the Chebyshev measure of the first kind. It is noteworthy that this result presents a completely explicit construction of rational designs. Moreover, we create novel connections among Hilbert-Kamke equations, geometric designs and the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem. For example, we establish that the 5-designs with 6 points for the Chebyshev measure appear in the famous parametric solution for the PTE problem found by Borwein (2002).</description>

      <title>Arthur's groups $S$ in local Langlands correspondence for certain covering groups of algebraic tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the packets, precisely Arthur's groups $S$, in local Langlands correspondence for Brylinski-Deligne covering groups of algebraic tori, under some assumption on ramification. Especially, this work generalizes Weissman's result on covering groups of tori that split over an unramified extension of the base field.</description>

      <title>Split degenerate superelliptic curves and $\ell$-adic images of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field with a discrete valuation, and let $p$ and $\ell$ be (possibly equal) primes which are not necessarily different from the residue characteristic. Given a superelliptic curve $C : y^p = f(x)$ which has split degenerate reduction over $K$, with Jacobian denoted by $J / K$, we describe the action of an element of the inertia group $I_K$ on the $\ell$-adic Tate module $T_\ell(J)$ as a product of powers of certain transvections with respect to the $\ell$-adic Weil pairing and the canonical principal polarization of $J$. The powers to which the transvections are taken are given by a formula depending entirely on the cluster data of the roots of the defining polynomial $f$. This result is demonstrated using Mumford's non-archimedean uniformization of the curve $C$.</description>

      <title>On the number of sets with small sumset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate subsets with small sumset in arbitrary abelian groups. For an abelian group $G$ and an $n$-element subset $Y \subseteq G$ we show that if $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, then the number of subsets $A \subseteq Y$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$ is at most \[2^{o(s)}\binom{\frac{m+\beta}{2}}{s},\] where $\beta$ is the size of the largest subgroup of $G$ of size at most $\left(1+o(1)\right)m$. This bound is sharp for $\mathbb{Z}$ and many other groups. Our result improves the one of Campos and nearly bridges the remaining gap in a conjecture of Alon, Balogh, Morris, and Samotij.
  We also explore the behaviour of uniformly chosen random sets $A \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$. Under the same assumption that $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, we show that with high probability there exists an arithmetic progression $P \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ of size at most $m/2 + o(m)$ containing all but $o(s)$ elements of $A$. Analogous results are obtained for asymmetric sumsets, improving results by Campos, Coulson, Serra, and W\"otzel.
  The main tool behind our results is a more efficient container-type theorem developed for sets with small sumset, which gives an essentially optimal collection of containers. The proof of this combines an adapted hypergraph container lemma, that caters to the asymmetric setup as well, with a novel ``preprocessing'' graph container lemma, which allows the hypergraph container lemma to be called upon significantly less times than was necessary before.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints.
  Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions.
  In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a&lt;b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</description>

      <title>Inequalities and asymptotics for hook lengths in $\ell$-regular partitions and $\ell$-distinct partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study hook lengths in $\ell$-regular partitions and $\ell$-distinct partitions. More precisely, we establish hook length inequalities between $\ell$-regular partitions and $\ell$-distinct partitions for hook lengths $2$ and $3$, by deriving asymptotic formulas for the total number of hooks of length $t$ in both partition classes, for $t = 1, 2, 3$. From these asymptotics, we show that the ratio of the total number of hooks of length $t$ in $\ell$-regular partitions to those in $\ell$-distinct partitions tends to a constant that depends on $\ell$ and $t$. We also provide hook length inequalities within $\ell$-regular partitions and within $\ell$-distinct partitions.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal designs and the Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of ellipsoidal design was first introduced by Pandey (2022) as a full generalization of spherical designs on the unit circle $S^1$. In this paper, we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between ellipsoidal design and the two-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem, say ${\mathrm PTE}_2$, originally introduced by Alpers and Tijdeman (2007) as a natural generalization of the classical one-dimensional PTE problem (${\mathrm PTE}_1$). We first provide a combinatorial criterion for the construction of solutions of ${\mathrm PTE}_2$ from a pair of ellipsoidal designs. We also give an arithmetic proof of the Stroud-type bound for ellipsoidal designs, and then establish a classification theorem for designs with equality. Such a classification result is closely related to an open question on the existence of rational spherical $4$-designs on $S^1$, discussed in Cui, Xia and Xiang (2019). As far as the authors know, a family of ideal solutions found by Alpers and Tijdeman is the first and the only known parametric solution of degree $5$ for ${\mathrm PTE}_2$. As one of our main theorems, we prove that the Alpers--Tijdeman solution is equivalent to a certain two-dimensional extension of the famous Borwein solution for ${\mathrm PTE}_1$. As a by-product of this theorem, we discover a family of ellipsoidal $5$-designs among the Alpers--Tijdeman solution.</description>

      <title>A stacky approach to prismatic crystals via $q$-prism charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a locally complete intersection over $\mathcal{O}_K$ containing a $p$-power root of unity $\zeta_p$. We classify the derived category of prismatic crystals on the absolute prismatic site of $Y$ by studying quasi-coherent complexes on the prismatization of $Y$ via $q$-prism charts. We also develop a Galois descent mechanism to remove the assumption on $\mathcal{O}_K$. As an application, we classify quasi-coherent complexes on the Cartier-Witt stack and give a purely algebraic calculation of the cohomology of the structure sheaf on the absolute prismatic site of $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Along the way, for $Y$ a locally complete intersection over $\overline{A}$ with $A$ lying over a $q$-prism, we classify quasi-coherent complexes on the relative prismatization of $Y$.</description>
