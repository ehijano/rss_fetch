      <title>Enabling Next-Generation V2X Perception: Wireless Rigid Body Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) perception describes a suite of technologies used to enable vehicles to perceive their surroundings and communicate with various entities, such as other road users, infrastructure, or the network/cloud. With the development of autonomous driving, V2X perception is becoming increasingly relevant, as can be seen by the tremendous attention recently given to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technologies. In this context, rigid body localization (RBL) also emerges as one important technology which enables the estimation of not only target's positions, but also their shape and orientation. This article discusses the need for RBL, its benefits and opportunities, challenges and research directions, as well as its role in the standardization of the sixth-generation (6G) and beyond fifth generation (B5G) applications.</description>

      <title>Illumination Design for Joint Imaging and Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept termed Integrated Imaging and Wireless Power Transfer (IWPT), wherein the integration of imaging and wireless power transfer functionalities is achieved on a unified hardware platform. IWPT leverages a transmitting array to efficiently illuminate a specific Region of Interest (ROI), enabling the extraction of ROI's scattering coefficients while concurrently providing wireless power to nearby users. The integration of IWPT offers compelling advantages, including notable reductions in power consumption and spectrum utilization, pivotal for the optimization of future 6G wireless networks. As an initial investigation, we explore two antenna architectures: a fully digital array and a digital/analog hybrid array. Our goal is to characterize the fundamental trade-off between imaging and wireless power transfer by optimizing the illumination signal. With imaging operating in the near-field, we formulate the illumination signal design as an optimization problem that minimizes the condition number of the equivalent channel. To address this optimization problem, we propose an semi-definite relaxation-based approach for the fully digital array and an alternating optimization algorithm for the hybrid array. Finally, numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed solutions and demonstrate the trade-off between imaging and wireless power transfer.</description>

      <title>Finding Defective Elements in Intelligent Reflecting Surface via Over-the-Air Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to circuit failures, defective elements that cannot adaptively adjust the phase shifts of their impinging signals in a desired manner may exist on an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Traditional way to find these defective IRS elements requires a thorough diagnosis of all the circuits belonging to a huge number of IRS elements, which is practically challenging. In this paper, we will devise a novel approach under which a transmitter sends known pilot signals and a receiver localizes all the defective IRS elements just based on its over-the-air measurements reflected from the IRS. The key lies in the fact that the over-the-air measurements at the receiver side are functions of the set of defective IRS elements. Based on this observation, we propose a bisection based method to localize all the defective IRS elements. Specifically, at each time slot, we properly control the desired phase shifts of all the IRS elements such that half of the considered regime that is not useful to localize the defective elements can be found based on the received signals and removed. Via numerical results, it is shown that our proposed bisection method can exploit the over-the-air measurements to localize all the defective IRS elements quickly and accurately.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Channel Simulator and Semi- Supervised Learning for Efficient Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to tackle the labor-intensive and resource-consuming task of indoor positioning by proposing an efficient approach. The proposed approach involves the introduction of a semi-supervised learning (SSL) with a biased teacher (SSLB) algorithm, which effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled channel data. To reduce measurement expenses, unlabeled data is generated using an updated channel simulator (UCHS), and then weighted by adaptive confidence values to simplify the tuning of hyperparameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves superior performance while minimizing measurement overhead and training expense compared to existing benchmarks, offering a valuable and practical solution for indoor positioning.</description>

      <title>Flexible Beam Coverage Optimization for Movable-Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antennas (FAs) and movable antennas (MAs) have attracted increasing attention in wireless communications recently. As compared to the conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), their geometry can be dynamically reconfigured, such that more flexible beamforming can be achieved for signal coverage and/or interference nulling. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAs to achieve uniform coverage for multiple regions with arbitrary number and width in the spatial domain. In particular, we aim to jointly optimize the MAs weights and positions within a linear array to maximize the minimum beam gain over the desired spatial regions. However, the resulting problem is non-convex and difficult to be optimally solved. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution, where the MAs weights and positions are alternately optimized by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results show that our proposed MAbased beam coverage scheme can achieve much better performance than conventional FPAs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Patient Fine-Tuned Seizure Detection with a Tensor Kernel Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in wearable devices have made accurate and efficient seizure detection more important than ever. A challenge in seizure detection is that patient-specific models typically outperform patient-independent models. However, in a wearable device one typically starts with a patient-independent model, until such patient-specific data is available. To avoid having to construct a new classifier with this data, as required in conventional kernel machines, we propose a transfer learning approach with a tensor kernel machine. This method learns the primal weights in a compressed form using the canonical polyadic decomposition, making it possible to efficiently update the weights of the patient-independent model with patient-specific data. The results show that this patient fine-tuned model reaches as high a performance as a patient-specific SVM model with a model size that is twice as small as the patient-specific model and ten times as small as the patient-independent model.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Power-Aware Learned Optimization for Modular Receive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems play a key role in wireless communication technologies. A widely considered approach to realize scalable MIMO systems involves architectures comprised of multiple separate modules, each with its own beamforming capability. Such models accommodate cell-free massive MIMO and partially connected hybrid MIMO architectures. A core issue with the implementation of modular MIMO arises from the need to rapidly set the beampatterns of the modules, while maintaining their power efficiency. This leads to challenging constrained optimization that should be repeatedly solved on each coherence duration. In this work, we propose a power-oriented optimization algorithm for beamforming in uplink modular hybrid MIMO systems, which learns from data to operate rapidly. We derive our learned optimizer by tackling the rate maximization objective using projected gradient ascent steps with momentum. We then leverage data to tune the hyperparameters of the optimizer, allowing it to operate reliably in a fixed and small number of iterations while completely preserving its interpretable operation. We show how power efficient beamforming can be encouraged by the learned optimizer, via boosting architectures with low-resolution phase shifts and with deactivated analog components. Numerical results show that our learn-to-optimize method notably reduces the number of iterations and computation latency required to reliably tune modular MIMO receivers, and that it allows obtaining desirable balances between power efficient designs and throughput.</description>

      <title>Leveraging PRS and PDSCH for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the industrial standpoint on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), the preference lies in augmenting existing infrastructure with sensing services while minimizing network changes and leveraging available resources. This paper investigates the potential of utilizing the existing infrastructure of fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) signals as defined by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), particularly focusing on pilot signals for sensing within the ISAC framework. We propose to take advantage of the existing positioning reference signal (PRS) for sensing and the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) for communication, both readily available in 5G NR. However, the use of PRS for sensing poses challenges, leading to the appearance of ghost targets.
  To overcome this obstacle, we propose two innovative approaches for different PRS comb sizes within the ISAC framework, leveraging the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) within PDSCH to eliminate ghost targets. Subsequently, we formulate a resource allocation problem between PRS and PDSCH and determine the Pareto optimal point between communication and sensing without ghost targets. Through comprehensive simulation and analysis, we demonstrate that the joint exploitation of DMRS and PRS offers a promising solution for ghost target removal, while effective time and frequency resource allocation enables the achievement of Pareto optimality in ISAC.</description>

      <title>Doppler Ambiguity Elimination Using 5G Signals in Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The industrial point of view towards integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), the preference is to leverage existing resources and fifth-generation (5G) infrastructure to minimize deployment costs and complexity. In this context, we explore the utilization of current 5G new radio (NR) signals aligned with 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards. Positioning reference signals (PRS) for sensing and physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) for communication have been chosen to form an ISAC framework. However, PRS-based sensing suffers from Doppler ambiguity when the Doppler frequency shift is severe. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method within the ISAC system that leverages the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) present in PDSCH to eliminate Doppler ambiguity. Furthermore, we formulate a resource allocation problem between PRS and PDSCH to achieve a Pareto optimal point between communication and sensing without Doppler ambiguity. Through simulations and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on joint DMRS-PRS exploitation in mitigating Doppler ambiguity and the efficiency of the resource allocation scheme in achieving Pareto optimality for ISAC within a 5G NR framework.</description>

      <title>A deep learning-enabled smart garment for versatile sleep behaviour monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring and accurate detection of complex sleep patterns associated to different sleep-related conditions is essential, not only for enhancing sleep quality but also for preventing the risk of developing chronic illnesses associated to unhealthy sleep. Despite significant advances in research, achieving versatile recognition of various unhealthy and sub-healthy sleep patterns with simple wearable devices at home remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a robust and durable ultrasensitive strain sensor array printed on a smart garment, in its collar region. This solution allows detecting subtle vibrations associated with multiple sleep patterns at the extrinsic laryngeal muscles. Equipped with a deep learning neural network, it can precisely identify six sleep states-nasal breathing, mouth breathing, snoring, bruxism, central sleep apnea (CSA), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-with an impressive accuracy of 98.6%, all without requiring specific positioning. We further demonstrate its explainability and generalization capabilities in practical applications. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) visualizations reflect comprehensive signal pattern analysis with low bias. Transfer learning tests show that the system can achieve high accuracy (overall accuracy of 95%) on new users with very few-shot learning (less than 15 samples per class). The scalable manufacturing process, robustness, high accuracy, and excellent generalization of the smart garment make it a promising tool for next-generation continuous sleep monitoring.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fault Detection and Cause Identification Using Integrated Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel methodology for fault detection and cause identification within the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) by integrating a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network with an Integrated Attention Mechanism (IAM). The IAM combines the strengths of scaled dot product attention, residual attention, and dynamic attention to capture intricate patterns and dependencies crucial for TEP fault detection. Initially, the attention mechanism extracts important features from the input data, enhancing the model's interpretability and relevance. The BiLSTM network processes these features bidirectionally to capture long-range dependencies, and the IAM further refines the output, leading to improved fault detection results. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showcasing superior performance in accuracy, false alarm rate, and misclassification rate compared to existing methods. This methodology provides a robust and interpretable solution for fault detection and diagnosis in the TEP, highlighting its potential for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Group Testing and Pooled Data in the Linear Regime with Sublinear Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the number of items. For both QGT and pooled data, this is the first efficient scheme that provably achieves recovery in the linear regime with a sublinear number of tests, with performance degrading gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.</description>

      <title>Joint Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization with Self-Interference Mitigation in MA-ISAC system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming design has been extensively investigated in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The use of movable antennas has proven effective in enhancing the design of beamforming. Although some studies have explored joint optimization of transmit beamforming matrices and antenna positions in bistatic scenarios, there is a gap in the literature regarding monostatic full-duplex (FD) systems. To fill this gap, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions at both the transmitter and the receiver in a monostatic FD system. In an FD system, suppressing self-interference is crucial. This interference can be significantly reduced by carefully designing transmit and receive beamforming matrices. To further enhance the suppression, we derive a formulation of self-interference characterized by antenna position vectors. This enables the strategic positioning of movable antennas to further mitigate interference. Our approach optimizes the weighted sum of communication capacity and mutual information by simultaneously optimizing beamforming and antenna positions for both tranceivers. Specifically, we propose a coarse-to-fine grained search algorithm (CFGS) to find optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm provides significant improvements for the MA system compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to Embed Distributions via Maximum Kernel Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Line-of-Sight Fading Distribution: Statistical Characterization and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the fluctuating Line-of-Sight (fLoS) fading model, characterized by parameters $K$, $k$, $\lambda$, and $\Omega$. The fLoS fading distribution is expressed in terms of the multivariate confluent hypergeometric functions $\Psi_2$, $\Phi_3^{(n)}$, and $\Phi_3 = \Phi_3^{(2)}$ and encompasses well-known distributions, such as the Nakagami-$m$, Hoyt, Rice, and Rician shadowed fading distributions as special cases. An efficient method to numerically compute the fLoS fading distribution is also addressed. Notably, for a positive integer $k$, the fLoS fading distribution simplifies to a finite mixture of $\kappa$-$\mu$ distributions. Additionally, we analyze the outage probability and Ergodic capacity, presenting a tailored Prony's approximation method for the latter. Numerical results are presented to show the impact of the fading parameters and verify the accuracy of the proposed approximation. Moreover, we illustrate an application of the proposed fLoS fading distribution for characterizing wireless systems affected by channel aging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the statistical characterization of ground-to-air (G2A) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted air-to-ground (A2G) communications in RIS-assisted UAV networks under the impact of channel aging. A comprehensive channel model is presented, which incorporates the time-varying fading, three-dimensional (3D) mobility, Doppler shifts, and the effects of channel aging on array antenna structures. We provide analytical expressions for the G2A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF), demonstrating that the G2A SNR follows a mixture of noncentral $\chi^2$ distributions. The A2G communication is characterized under RIS arbitrary phase-shift configurations, showing that the A2G SNR can be represented as the product of two correlated noncentral $\chi^2$ random variables (RVs). Additionally, we present the PDF and the CDF of the product of two independently distributed noncentral $\chi^2$ RVs, which accurately characterize the A2G SNR's distribution. Our paper confirms the effectiveness of RISs in mitigating channel aging effects within the coherence time. Finally, we propose an adaptive spectral efficiency method that ensures consistent system performance and satisfactory outage levels when the UAV and the ground user equipments are in motion.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Metrics and Methods for Generative Models in the Wireless PHY Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models are typically evaluated by direct inspection of their generated samples, e.g., by visual inspection in the case of images. Further evaluation metrics like the Fr\'echet inception distance or maximum mean discrepancy are intricate to interpret and lack physical motivation. These observations make evaluating generative models in the wireless PHY layer non-trivial. This work establishes a framework consisting of evaluation metrics and methods for generative models applied to the wireless PHY layer. The proposed metrics and methods are motivated by wireless applications, facilitating interpretation and understandability for the wireless community. In particular, we propose a spectral efficiency analysis for validating the generated channel norms and a codebook fingerprinting method to validate the generated channel directions. Moreover, we propose an application cross-check to evaluate the generative model's samples for training machine learning-based models in relevant downstream tasks. Our analysis is based on real-world measurement data and includes the Gaussian mixture model, variational autoencoder, diffusion model, and generative adversarial network as generative models. Our results under a fair comparison in terms of model architecture indicate that solely relying on metrics like the maximum mean discrepancy produces insufficient evaluation outcomes. In contrast, the proposed metrics and methods exhibit consistent and explainable behavior.</description>

      <title>CrystalTac: 3D-Printed Vision-Based Tactile Sensor Family through Rapid Monolithic Manufacturing Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) have gained popularity in robotics systems. The sensing mechanisms of most VBTSs can be categorised based on the type of tactile features they capture. Each category requires specific structural designs to convert physical contact into optical information. The complex architectures of VBTSs pose challenges for traditional manufacturing techniques in terms of design flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and quality stability. Previous research has shown that monolithic manufacturing using multi-material 3D printing technology can partially address these challenges. This study introduces the CrystalTac family, a series of VBTSs designed with a unique sensing mechanism and fabricated through rapid monolithic manufacturing. Case studies on CrystalTac-type sensors demonstrate their effective performance in tasks involving tactile perception, along with impressive cost-effectiveness and design flexibility. The CrystalTac family aims to highlight the potential of monolithic manufacturing in VBTS development and inspire further research in tactile sensing and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Investigating Brain Connectivity and Regional Statistics from EEG for early stage Parkinson's Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of combining brain connectivity metrics with signal statistics for early stage Parkinson's Disease (PD) classification using electroencephalogram data (EEG). The data is from 5 arousal states - wakeful and four sleep stages (N1, N2, N3 and REM). Our pipeline uses an Ada Boost model for classification on a challenging early stage PD classification task with with only 30 participants (11 PD , 19 Healthy Control). Evaluating 9 brain connectivity metrics we find the best connectivity metric to be different for each arousal state with Phase Lag Index achieving the highest individual classification accuracy of 86\% on N1 data. Further to this our pipeline using regional signal statistics achieves an accuracy of 78\%, using brain connectivity only achieves an accuracy of 86\% whereas combining the two achieves a best accuracy of 91\%. This best performance is achieved on N1 data using Phase Lag Index (PLI) combined with statistics derived from the frequency characteristics of the EEG signal. This model also achieves a recall of 80 \% and precision of 96\%. Furthermore we find that on data from each arousal state, combining PLI with regional signal statistics improves classification accuracy versus using signal statistics or brain connectivity alone. Thus we conclude that combining brain connectivity statistics with regional EEG statistics is optimal for classifier performance on early stage Parkinson's. Additionally, we find outperformance of N1 EEG for classification of Parkinson's and expect this could be due to disrupted N1 sleep in PD. This should be explored in future work.</description>

      <title>MV-PURE Spatial Filters with Application to EEG/MEG Source Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.02997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose spatial filters for a linear regression model which are based on the minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank estimation (MV-PURE) framework. As a sample application, we consider the problem of reconstruction of brain activity from electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements. The proposed filters come in two versions depending on whether or not the EEG/MEG forward model explicitly considers interfering activity in the way of brain activity originating in regions different to those of main interest, but measured as correlated with signals of interest by the EEG/MEG sensor array. In both cases, the proposed filters are equipped with a rank-selection criterion minimizing the mean-square error (MSE) of the filter output. Therefore, we consider them as novel nontrivial generalizations of well-known linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) and nulling filters. In order to facilitate reproducibility of our research, we provide (jointly with this paper) comprehensive simulation framework that allows for estimation of error of signal reconstruction for a number of spatial filters applied to MEG or EEG signals. Based on this framework, chief properties of proposed filters are verified in a set of detailed simulations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of localization of sources of brain electrical activity from electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements using spatial filtering techniques. We propose novel reduced-rank activity indices based on the minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank estimation (MV-PURE) framework. The main results of this paper establish the key unbiasedness property of the proposed indices and their higher spatial resolution compared with full-rank indices in challenging task of localizing closely positioned and possibly highly correlated sources, especially in low signal-to-noise regime. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the practical applicability of the proposed activity indices using both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Wearable Technologies for Monitoring Upper Extremity Functions During Daily Life in Neurologically Impaired Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurological disorders, including stroke, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, generally lead to diminished upper extremity (UE) function, impacting individuals' independence and quality of life. Traditional assessments predominantly focus on standardized clinical tasks, offering limited insights into real-life UE performance. In this context, this review focuses on wearable technologies as a promising solution to monitor UE function in neurologically impaired individuals during daily life activities. Our primary objective is to categorize the different sensors, review the data collection and understand the employed data processing approaches. After screening over 1500 papers and including 21 studies, what comes to light is that the majority of them involved stroke survivors, and predominantly employed accelerometers or inertial measurement units to collect kinematics. Most analyses in these studies were performed offline, focusing on activity duration and frequency as key metrics. Although wearable technology shows potential in monitoring UE function in real-life scenarios, it also appears that a solution combining non-intrusiveness, lightweight design, detailed hand and finger movement capture, contextual information, extended recording duration, ease of use, and privacy protection remains an elusive goal. These are critical characteristics for a monitoring solution and researchers in the field should try to integrate the most in future developments. Last but not least, it stands out a growing necessity for a multimodal approach in capturing comprehensive data on UE function during real-life activities to enhance the personalization of rehabilitation strategies and ultimately improve outcomes for these individuals.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Diagnostic Capabilities of Methods of Recreation of Voltage Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voltage fluctuations are one of the most common low-frequency disturbances of power quality. Diagnostics of these disturbances are a complex process because voltage fluctuations affect different loads in different ways. Therefore, there is no measure of power quality that allows for the complementary assessment of severity of this disturbance, allow for the identification of sources of voltage fluctuations, and post-factum investigation of their effects. Among the currently used measures of voltage fluctuations, voltage fluctuation indices have the greatest diagnostic capabilities. Many preliminary studies also show the potential possibility of recreation of voltage fluctuations, including: based on voltage fluctuation indices. This paper presents the results of research on methods of recreation of voltage fluctuations from voltage fluctuation indices. The research carried out included a set of data obtained in a real power grid. Moreover, the impact of the discrimination period on the accuracy of recreation of voltage fluctuations has been assessed. The presented research results show, on the one hand, the usefulness of voltage fluctuation indices in the process of recreation of voltage fluctuations and, on the other hand, further challenges in the recreation of voltage fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Setup for Testing Low-Frequency Disturbances of Power Quality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-frequency disturbances of power quality are one of the most common disturbances in the power grid. These disturbances are most often the result of the impact of power electronic and energy-saving devices, the number of which is increasing significantly in the power grid. Due to the simultaneous operation of various types of loads in the power grid, various types of simultaneous disturbances of power quality occur, such as voltage fluctuations and distortions. Therefore, there is a need to analyze this type of simultaneous interaction. For this purpose, a special and complementary laboratory setup has been prepared, which allows for the examination of actual states occurring in modern power networks. Selected research results are presented for this laboratory setup, which determine its basic properties. Possible applications and possibilities of the laboratory setup are presented from the point of view of current challenges.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Innovation in 6G Research: Real-Time Capable SDR System Architecture for Rapid Prototyping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming 3GPP global mobile communication standard 6G strives to push the technological limits of radio frequency (RF) communication even further than its predecessors: Sum data rates beyond 100 Gbit/s, RF bandwidths above 1 GHz per link, and sub-millisecond latency necessitate very high performance development tools. We propose a new SDR firmware and software architecture designed explicitly to meet these challenging requirements. It relies on Ethernet and commercial off-the-shelf network and server components to maximize flexibility and to reduce costs. We analyze state-of-the-art solutions (USRP X440 and other RFSoC-based systems), derive architectural design goals, explain resulting design decision in detail, and exemplify our architecture's implementation on the XCZU48DR RFSoC. Finally, we validate its performance via measurements and outline how the architecture surpasses the state-of-the-art with respect to sustained RF recording, while maintaining high Ethernet bandwidth efficiency. Building a 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) example, we demonstrate its real-time and rapid application development capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose greedy Capon beamformer (GCB) for direction finding of narrow-band sources present in the array's viewing field. After defining the grid covering the location search space, the algorithm greedily builds the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix by identifying a high-power source on the grid using Capon's principle of maximizing the signal to interference plus noise ratio while enforcing unit gain towards the signal of interest. An estimate of the power of the detected source is derived by exploiting the unit power constraint, which subsequently allows to update the noise covariance matrix by simple rank-1 matrix addition composed of outerproduct of the selected steering matrix with itself scaled by the signal power estimate. Our numerical examples demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed GCB in direction finding where it performs favourably compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms under a broad variety of settings. Furthermore, GCB estimates of direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) are very fast to compute.</description>

Abstract: In aviation, the impact of threats is becoming increasingly significant, particularly for global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Two relevant GNSS threats are represented by jamming and spoofing. In order to evaluate the technological solutions to counter GNSS attacks, such attacks should be assessed by means of a proper GNSS threat simulator. This work shows the implementation and the testing results of a GNSS security impact simulator which injects the desired threat scenarios as a deviations on the GNSS actual measurements. The proposed simulator can be integrated in both real- and fast-time simulation environments. The provided results confirm the effectiveness of the simulator, and include in-flight demonstrations by means of a flight experimental vehicle.</description>

Abstract: This letter explores an implementation of a novel thin film 1-by-4 reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designed for future communication and sensing scenarios. Utilizing cost-effective inkjet printing methods and additive manufacturing, our approach significantly simplifies the RIS construction process and reduces production costs. The RIS, fabricated on a flexible and lightweight polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, integrates antennas, switching circuitry, and a microcontroller unit (MCU), without a ground shield. This setup enables individual and simultaneous control of each RIS element, manipulating the captured carrier signal by reflecting and refracting its dominant harmonics. Beams of the harmonics can be steered to multiple desired directions at both front and back sides of the surface. Measurement results of the beam steering show that the RIS has the potential to enable RIS-aided communication and sensing applications.</description>

Abstract: Wireless communications are significantly impacted by the propagation environment, particularly in doubly selective channels with variations in both time and frequency domains. Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising solution; however, its high equalization complexity, if performed in the delay-Doppler domain, limits its universal application. This article explores domain-adaptive system design, dynamically selecting best-fit domains for modulation, pilot placement, and equalization based on channel conditions, to enhance performance across diverse environments. We examine domain classifications and connections, signal designs, and equalization techniques with domain adaptivity, and finally highlight future research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Application of Transformers for Nonlinear Channel Compensation in Optical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new nonlinear optical channel equalizer based on Transformers. By leveraging parallel computation and attending directly to the memory across a sequence of symbols, we show that Transformers can be used effectively for nonlinear compensation (NLC) in coherent long-haul transmission systems. For this application, we present an implementation of the encoder part of the Transformer and analyze its performance over a wide range of different hyper-parameters. It is shown that by proper embeddings and processing blocks of symbols at each iteration and also carefully selecting subsets of the encoder's output to be processed together, an efficient nonlinear equalization can be achieved for different complexity constraints. To reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism, we further propose the use of a physic-informed mask inspired by nonlinear perturbation theory. We also compare the Transformer-NLC with digital back-propagation (DBP) under different transmission scenarios in order to demonstrate the flexibility and generalizability of the proposed data-driven solution.</description>

Abstract: A different method of discovering how neurons are connected to process information is presented here: Design a simple logic circuit that can perform a single, biologically advantageous function. Engineering concepts can be helpful in choosing the function and in designing the logic circuit. Several implementations of the method are reviewed to demonstrate how a biologically advantageous function can be chosen, how one simple network can generate major phenomena that are widely considered unrelated, and how one network design can lead to others that explain entirely different aspects of the brain. These results show that the method can benefit neuromorphic engineering as well as neuroscience, and that some brain functions can be carried out remarkably simply, at least in principle if not in the details.</description>

Abstract: In-band full-duplex (IBFD) is a theoretically effective solution to increase the overall throughput for the future wireless communications system by enabling transmission and reception over the same time-frequency resources. However, reliable source reconstruction remains a great challenge in the practical IBFD systems due to the non-ideal elimination of the self-interference and the inherent limitations of the separate source and channel coding methods. On the other hand, artificial intelligence-enabled semantic communication can provide a viable direction for the optimization of the IBFD system. This article introduces a novel IBFD paradigm with the guidance of semantic communication called semantics-division duplexing (SDD). It utilizes semantic domain processing to further suppress self-interference, distinguish the expected semantic information, and recover the desired sources. Further integration of the digital and semantic domain processing can be implemented so as to achieve intelligent and concise communications. We present the advantages of the SDD paradigm with theoretical explanations and provide some visualized results to verify its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</title>

Abstract: Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

      <title>Joint Resource-Power Allocation and UE Rank Selection in Multi-User MIMO Systems with Linear Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16483</link>

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks aim to deliver data speeds much faster than 5G. This requires base stations with lots of antennas and a large operating bandwidth. These advanced base stations are expected to serve several multiantenna user-equipment (UEs) simultaneously on the same time-frequency resources on both the uplink and the downlink. The UE data rates are affected by the following three main factors: UE rank, which refers to the number of data layers used by each UE, UE frequency allocation, which refers to the assignment of slices of the overall frequency band to use for each UE in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, and UE power allocation/control, which refers to the allocation of power by the base station for data transmission to each UE on the downlink or the power used by each UE to send data on the uplink. Since multiple UEs are to be simultaneously served, the type of precoder used for downlink transmission and the type of receiver used for uplink reception predominantly influence these three aforementioned factors and the resulting overall UE throughput. This paper addresses the problem of jointly selecting these three parameters specifically when zero-forcing (ZF) precoders are used for downlink transmission and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) receivers are employed for uplink reception.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Functional Insufficiencies and Triggering Conditions to Improve the SOTIF of an MPC-based Trajectory Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated and autonomous driving has made a significant technological leap over the past decade. In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</description>
