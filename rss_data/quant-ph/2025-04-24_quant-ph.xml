      <title>Comment on "Provably Trainable Rotationally Equivariant Quantum Machine Learning"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We comment on the article by West {et al.}, ``Provably Trainable Rotationally Equivariant Quantum Machine Learning'' [PRX Quantum , 030320 (2024)]. While the general framework is insightful, we identify a key inconsistency in the construction of the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA). Specifically, the fixed controlled-Z (CZ) gates applied to all nearest-neighbor qubits are treated as if they were parameterized gates, with generators expressed in terms of combinations of Pauli operators. We discuss the implications of this inclusion and encourage the authors to revisit their analysis using a corrected DLA formulation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization group for matrix product density operators (MPDOs) provides a powerful framework for describing one-dimensional mixed-state phases of matter and the renormalization fixed points (RFPs) are representative states for analyzing nontrivial phases. Recently, it was found that anomalous symmetries can provide a fundamental obstruction for certain short-range correlated mixed states to be efficiently prepared. In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and represent a distinct class of MPDO RFPs from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.</description>

      <title>Quantum Randomness through Emergent Confinement Mechanism in Measured Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, arising from the measurement process that collapses superpositions into definite outcomes according to Born's rule. Generating large-scale random quantum states is crucial for quantum computing and many-body physics, yet remains a key challenge. We present a practical method based on local measurements of random Tensor Networks, focusing on random Matrix Product States (MPS) generated by two distinct quantum circuit architectures, both feasible on near-term devices. We certify the emergent quantum randomness using the frame potential and establish a mapping between its behavior and the statistical mechanics of a domain wall particle model. In both architectures, the effect of quantum measurements induces a nontrivial confinement mechanism, where domain walls are either trapped by an external potential or bound in pairs to form meson-like excitations. Our results, supported by both exact analytical calculations and numerical simulations, suggest that confinement is a general mechanism underlying random state generation in broader settings with local measurements, including quantum circuits and chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning to decode logical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of quantum hardware bringing the error-corrected quantum circuits to the near future, the lack of an efficient polynomial-time decoding algorithms for logical circuits presents a critical bottleneck. While quantum memory decoding has been well-studied, inevitable correlated errors introduced by entangling logical gates prevent the straightforward generalization of quantum memory decoders. We introduce a data-centric modular decoder framework, Multi-Core Circuit Decoder (MCCD), consisting of decoder modules corresponding to each logical operation supported by the quantum hardware. The MCCD handles both single-qubit and entangling gates within a unified framework. We train MCCD using mirror-symmetric random Clifford circuits, demonstrating its ability to effectively learn correlated decoding patterns. Through extensive testing on circuits significantly deeper than those used in training, we show that MCCD maintains high logical accuracy while exhibiting competitive polynomial decoding time across increasing circuit depths and code distances. When compared with conventional decoders like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), Most Likely Error (MLE), and Belief Propagation with Ordered Statistics Post-processing (BP-OSD), MCCD achieves competitive accuracy with substantially better time efficiency, particularly for circuits with entangling gates. Our approach represents a noise-model agnostic solution to the decoding challenge for deep logical quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Solitons in arbitrary dimensions stabilized by photon-mediated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate solitons in arbitrary dimensions, in a matter-wave interferometer, without the need of quantum degeneracy. In our setting, solitons emerge by balancing the single-particle dispersion with engineered cavity-mediated exchange interactions between two wave packets, which, at the appropriate conditions, remain bound to each other and dispersion-free. For detection in thermal gases, we propose an interferometric probing scheme instead of traditional time-of-flight imaging.</description>

      <title>Surface-code Superconducting Quantum Processors: From Calibration To Logical Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum processors are fragile, noisy and fairly limited in both quantity and quality with tens of qubits and physical error rates of around 10^-3. To realize practical quantum applications, however, error rates need to be below 10^-15 across millions of qubits. To bridge this gap and fully harness the potential of quantum computers, quantum error correction (QEC) is essential. QEC codes are designed to protect quantum information by redundantly encoding it onto multiple physical qubits. This encoding allows for the detection and correction of local errors affecting individual qubits, e.g., through stabilizer measurements. Importantly, if the physical error rates are below a specific threshold, QEC codes can exponentially suppress logical error rates by increasing the number of physical qubits involved. This is essential for achieving fault-tolerant computations, which are key to unlocking the full potential of quantum computers. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the implementation and optimization of small-scale QEC experiments using the surface code and flux-tunable superconducting qubits (Transmons). It addresses several key challenges: enhancing two-qubit gate fidelity in Surface-4 (Chapter 2), implementing an error-detection code with Surface-7 (Chapter 3), automating the calibration and benchmarking of the building blocks in Surface-17 (Chapter 4), reducing leakage into higher excited states with leakage reduction units (Chapter 5), assessing and enhancing the performance of logical qubits (Chapters 7 and 8).</description>

      <title>Construction of Boolean Logic Gates Using QFT-Based Adder Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we construct the quantum reversible counterparts of the logical AND, OR, XOR, NOR, and NAND gates. We utilize a quantum Fourier transform (QFT)-based adder circuit that replicates the functionality of a digital half-adder, which computes the sum and carry of two input bits using XOR and AND gates, respectively. To realize different logic gate operations, we apply pre- and post-processing to the QFT-adder using quantum gates, leveraging Boolean algebra properties to enable conversions between various logical functions. Although the number of elementary quantum logic gates increases for a small number of inputs-making the approach appear inefficient at first glance-the overall required qubit count is reduced compared to non-QFT-based designs as the number of inputs increases.</description>

      <title>OneAdapt: Adaptive Compilation for Resource-Constrained Photonic One-Way Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), a.k.a. one-way quantum computing (1WQC), is a universal quantum computing model, which is particularly well-suited for photonic platforms. In this model, computation is driven by measurements on an entangled state, which serves as an intermediate representation (IR) between program and hardware. However, compilers on previous IRs lacks the adaptability to the resource constraint in photonic quantum computers. In this work, we propose a novel IR with new optimization passes. Based on this, it realizes a resource-adaptive compiler that minimizes the required hardware size and execution time while restricting the requirement for fusion devices within an adaptive limit. Moreover, our optimization can be integrated with Quantum Error Correction (QEC) to improve the efficiency of photonic fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC).</description>

      <title>Biasing quantum trajectories for enhanced sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum continuous measurement strategies consist an essential element in many modern sensing technologies leading to potentially enhanced estimation of unknown physical parameters. In such schemes, continuous monitoring of the quantum system which encodes the parameters of interest, gives rise to different quantum trajectories conditioned on the measurement outcomes which carry information on the parameters themselves. Importantly, different trajectories carry different amount of information i.e they are more or less sensitive to the unknown parameters of interest. In this work, we propose a novel approach on how to systematically engineer the quantum open-system dynamics in order to increase the probability of obtaining trajectories of high sensitivity. We focus on the simplest case scenario of a single two level system interacting with ancillas which are in turn measured consisting the discretized version of continuous monitoring. We analyze the performance of our protocol and demonstrate that it may lead to a substantial enhancement of sensitivity, as quantified by the classical Fisher information, even when applied to such small system sizes, holding the promise of direct implementation to state-of-the-art experimental platforms and to large, complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Technologies for Beyond 5G and 6G Networks: Applications, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the world prepares for the advent of 6G networks, quantum technologies are becoming critical enablers of the next generation of communication systems. This survey paper investigates the convergence of quantum technologies and 6G networks, focusing on their applications, opportunities and challenges. We begin with an examination of the motivations for integrating quantum technologies into 6G, investigating the potential to overcome the limits of classical computing and cryptography. We then highlight key research gaps, particularly in quantum communication, quantum computing integration and security enhancement. A comprehensive overview of quantum technologies relevant to 6G, including quantum communication devices, quantum computing paradigms, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches is provided. A particular focus is on the role of quantum technologies in enhancing 6G Radio Access Networks (RAN), 6G core and edge network optimization, and 6G security. The survey paper also explores the application of quantum cryptography with a focus on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC) and quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms and assesses their implementation challenges and potential impact on 6G networks. We also discuss the significant challenges associated with integrating quantum technologies into existing communications infrastructures, including issues of technological maturity, standardization, and economic considerations. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from current research and outline future research directions to guide the ongoing development of quantum-enabled 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Broadband Kinetic-Inductance Parametric Amplifiers with Impedance Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband quantum-limited parametric amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in quantum information science and technology. Impedance-engineered resonator-based PAs and traveling-wave PAs are the primary approaches to overcome the gain-bandwidth constraint. While the former PAs are simpler to fabricate, the target characteristic impedance Z_\text{NR} of the nonlinear resonator has been restricted to be below 10 \Omega, requiring large capacitance. Moreover, these PAs have only been implemented with aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs), hindering their operation at high temperatures or strong magnetic fields. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage impedance-transformer scheme, showcased with a 20-nm-thick, 250-nm-wide high-kinetic-inductance niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN) film. Our scheme enables Z_\text{NR} up to several tens of ohms--a tenfold improvement over conventional designs, achieved through an additional quarter-wavelength transmission line with the characteristic impedance of 180 \Omega. Our kinetic-inductance impedance-engineered parametric amplifiers (KIMPA), featuring a 330-fF shunt capacitor, demonstrate a phase-preserving amplification with a 450-MHz bandwidth at 17-dB gain, and an added noise ranging from 0.5-1.3 quanta near the center frequency of 8.4 GHz. Due to the high critical current of the NbTiN nanowire, the KIMPA also achieves a saturation power of up to -68\pm3 dBm, approximately 30-dB higher than that of JJ-based PAs. This scheme also opens new possibilities for other three-wave-mixing building blocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Change Detection and Joint Communication-Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quick detection of transmittance changes in optical channel is crucial for secure communication. We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using two-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency compared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The change detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative entropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise, suggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore the fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection latency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.</description>

      <title>Quantum stream cipher and Quantum block cipher -The Era of 100 Gbit/sec real-time encryption-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the part-II of the previous paper and introduces the world of Yuen's concept. In the theory of cryptology, the Shannon impossibility theorem states that the upper bound of the security of a plaintext against a ciphertext-only attack is the entropy of the secret key. At the same time, it gives the upper bound of the unicity distance against a known plaintext attack. Hence the development of a new symmetric key cipher requires finding a way to undo or lift this theorem. Such challenges have been attempted with quantum stream cipher and quantum data locking as block cipher. Both ciphers are designed by means of differentiating the receiving performance of Bob with key and Eve without key according to the principle of quantum communication theory. Thus, the origin of security of both ciphers come from the principle of keyed communication in quantum noise (KCQ) proposed by Yuen. In this paper, we explain and compare the principles and features of both cipher and assist to improve the quantum data locking scheme. Then we will introduce experimental research on quantum stream cipher towards commercialization, which has performance superior to conventional cipher.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective Optimization for Robust Holonomic Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust pulses have been widely used to reduce the sensitivity of quantum gate operations against various systematic errors due to the imperfections in practical quantum control. Yet, the typical optimization focuses on minimizing one type of errors serving as the one-objective algorithm, which arises a more susceptible sensitivity to other error sources. Optimizing multiple conflicting objectives of errors simultaneously remains a big challenge in quantum computing. Here, we propose a multiobjective optimization algorithm to achieve nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates with enhanced robustness. We show that by considering the amplitude error, the detuning error and the decoherence of the Rydberg state as three individual objectives to be minimized, this algorithm can effectively balance multiple competing objectives, giving rise to a set of Pareto optimal solutions. We apply the Entropy Weight method to select the best solution that implements the robust holonomic gates, outperforming existing optimal gates with one-objective by having both higher gate fidelity and stronger robustness. This numerical approach of optimizing gates with multiple objectives can be readily applied to other gate protocols featuring a promising advance in fault-tolerant quantum computing with Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Multipartite continuous-variable quantum nondemolition interaction and entanglement certification and monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied quantum measurement procedures. Usually, such process involves the coupling of a single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that the relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by observing the probe system. Here, we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings among the signal and probe modes with ancillary modes prepared off-line in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed by homodyne detections and feedforward modulations. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for post-modulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.</description>

      <title>Computing-heightened low-cost high-dimensional controlled-SUM gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qudit-based quantum gates offer several advantages over qubit-based counterparts, such as higher information density, the ability to address more complex problems, and richer quantum operations. In this paper, we present three realistic protocols for implementing a 4$\times$4-dimensional (16D) two-qudit controlled-SUM (CSUM) gate, where the 4D control qudit and 4D target qudit are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom (DoF) and spatial DoF of two photons, respectively. The first protocol is implemented exclusively using linear optical elements without auxiliary resources, making it feasible with current optical technologies and achieving an efficiency of 1/9. The second protocol utilizes photon scattering by a microcavity-quantum-dot system, enabling the 16D CSUM gate to operate deterministically without postselection. The third protocol introduces an error-heralded mechanism based on the second protocol, theoretically achieving unity fidelity. Moreover, all protocols operate without ancillary photons, offering the advantages of compact circuits and low cost while further promoting the development of high-dimensional quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Mach-Zehnder atom interferometry with non-interacting trapped Bose Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent manipulation of a quantum wave is at the core of quantum sensing. For instance, atom interferometers require linear splitting and recombination processes to map the accumulated phase shift into a measurable population signal. Although Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) are the archetype of coherent matter waves, their manipulation between trapped spatial modes has been limited by the strong interparticle collisions. Here, we overcome this problem by using BECs with tunable interaction trapped in an innovative array of double-well potentials and exploiting quantum tunneling to realize linear beam splitting. We operate several Mach-Zehnder interferometers in parallel, canceling common-mode potential instabilities by a differential analysis, thus demonstrating a trapped-atom gradiometer. Furthermore, by applying a spin-echo protocol, we suppress additional decoherence sources and approach unprecedented coherence times of one second. Our interferometer will find applications in precision measurements of forces with a high spatial resolution and in linear manipulation of quantum entangled states for sensing with sub shot-noise sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Classical Estimation of the Free Energy and Quantum Gibbs Sampling from the Markov Entropy Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Markov Entropy Decomposition, a classical convex relaxation algorithm introduced by Poulin and Hastings to approximate the free energy in quantum spin lattices. We identify a sufficient condition for its convergence, namely the decay of the effective interaction. We prove that this condition is satisfied for systems in 1D at any temperature as well as in the high-temperature regime under a certain commutativity condition on the Hamiltonian. This yields polynomial and quasi-polynomial time approximation algorithms in these settings, respectively. Furthermore, the decay of the effective interaction implies the decay of the conditional mutual information for the Gibbs state of the system. We then use this fact to devise a rounding scheme that maps the solution of the convex relaxation to a global state and show that the scheme can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, thus proving efficiency of quantum Gibbs sampling under our assumption of decay of the effective interaction.</description>

      <title>Leakage at zero temperature from changes in chemical potential in Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer requires physical qubits with exceptionally low error rates. Majorana-based tetron qubits are predicted to exhibit error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and length of each topological superconducting wire in the tetron. In contrast to this prediction, we show that errors arising from small variations in the chemical potential grow linearly with tetron length at zero temperature. These errors stem from leakage into excited quasiparticle states, which ultimately poison Majorana modes at opposite ends of the tetron, causing errors. We further demonstrate that the dynamics of this leakage is captured by the half Landau-Zener effect, which dictates its dependence on key system parameters such as the superconducting gap, chemical potential variations, and dynamic changes in the spatial profile of Majorana modes. These results motivate further investigations into the impact of leakage on qubit performance and potential mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Magic state distillation without measurements and post-selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state distillation (MSD) is a quantum algorithm that enables performing logical non-Clifford gates with in principle arbitrarily low noise level. It is herein typically assumed that logical Clifford gates can be executed without noise. Therefore, MSD is a standard subroutine to obtain a fault-tolerant universal set of quantum gate operations on error-corrected logical qubits. Well-known schemes conventionally rely on performing operator measurements and post-selection on the measurement result, which makes distillation protocols non-deterministic in the presence of noise. In this work, we adapt the 15-to-1 MSD protocol such that it deterministically suppresses noise by using a coherent feedback network on the output states without the need to perform individual qubit measurements. These advantages over textbook MSD come at the price of reducing the noise suppression per round from $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$. Our technique can be applied to any MSD protocol with an acceptance rate of 1 in the absence of noise. It may be desirable to use our scheme if the coherent feedback network can be executed faster and more reliably than the measurements and/or if logical clock cycles in the quantum processor should be kept synchronous at all times. Our result broadens the path of potential experimental realizations of MSD in near-term devices and advances the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with practical use.</description>

      <title>Quantum Autoencoder for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a hybrid evolutionary algorithm to minimize the depth of circuits in quantum computing. More specifically, we evaluate two different variants of the algorithm. In the first approach, we combine the evolutionary algorithm with an optimization subroutine to optimize the parameters of the rotation gates present in the quantum circuit. In the second, the algorithm solely relies on evolutionary operations (i.e., mutations and crossover). We approach the problem from two sides: (1) constructing circuits from the ground up by starting with random initializations and (2) initializing individuals with a target circuit in order to optimize it further according to the fitness function. We run experiments on random circuits with 4 and 6 qubits varying in circuit depth. Our results show that the proposed methods are able to significantly reduce the depth of circuits while still retaining a high fidelity to the target state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Known protocols for secure delegation of quantum computations from a client to a server in an information theoretic setting require quantum communication. In this work, we investigate methods to reduce communication overhead. First, we establish an impossibility result by proving that server-side local processes cannot decrease quantum communication requirements of secure delegation protocols. We develop no-go results that prohibit such processes within an information theoretic framework. Second, we present a possibility result by introducing Selectively Blind Quantum Computing (SBQC), a novel functionality that allows the client to hide one among a known set of possible computations. We characterize how differences between computations in the protected set influence the number of qubits sent during our SBQC implementation, yielding a communication-optimal protocol. This approach reduces qubit communication drastically and demonstrates the trade-off between information leaked to the server and communication cost.</description>

      <title>Extending quantum correlations to arbitrary distances via parallel repetition of routed Bell tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications such as Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (DIQKD) require loophole-free certification of long-distance quantum correlations. However, these distances remain severely constrained by detector inefficiencies and unavoidable transmission losses. To overcome this challenge, we consider parallel repetitions of the recently proposed routed Bell experiments, where transmissions from the source are actively directed either to a nearby or a distant measurement device. We analytically show that the threshold detection efficiency of the distant device--needed to certify non-jointly-measurable measurements, a prerequisite of secure DIQKD--decreases exponentially, optimally, and robustly, following $\eta^*=1/2^N$, with the number $N$ of parallel repetitions.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation, Zero Modes, and Collective Bound States in Constrained Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained models were originally introduced to capture slow relaxation in glassy systems, where dynamics are hindered by local constraints instead of energy barriers. Their quantum counterparts have recently drawn attention for exhibiting highly degenerate eigenstates at zero energy -- known as zero modes -- stemming from chiral symmetry. Yet, the structure and implications of these zero modes remain poorly understood. In this work, we focus on the properties of the zero mode subspace in quantum kinetically constrained models with a $U(1)$ particle-conservation symmetry. We use the $U(1)$ East, which lacks inversion symmetry, and the inversion-symmetric $U(1)$ East-West models to illustrate our two main results. First, we observe that the simultaneous presence of constraints and chiral symmetry generally leads to a parametric increase in the number of zero modes due to the fragmentation of the many-body Hilbert space into disconnected sectors. Second, we generalize the concept of compact localized states from single particle physics and introduce the notion of collective bound states. We formulate sufficient criteria for their existence, arguing that the degenerate zero mode subspace plays a central role, and demonstrate bound states in both example models. Our results motivate a systematic study of bound states and their relation to ergodicity breaking, transport, and other properties of quantum kinetically constrained models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring energy levels in quantum systems via Hamiltonian control parameters is essential for designing quantum thermodynamic devices and materials. However, conventional methods for manipulating finite-size systems, such as tuning external fields or system size, typically lead to uniform spectral shifts, limiting precise control. A recently introduced technique, called the size-invariant shape transformation, overcomes this by introducing a new control parameter that deforms the potential landscape without altering system size, enabling nonuniform level scaling. This shape parameter gives rise to quantum shape effects in confined systems, conceptually distinct from quantum size effects. We explore the limits of this phenomenon by asking: what is the minimal system in which such spectral behavior can emerge? We show that even a two-level system can exhibit thermodynamic consequences of quantum shape effects, including spontaneous transitions into lower-entropy states, a feature absent in classical thermodynamics for non-interacting systems. We identify the origin as geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling, where the ground-state energy and level spacing respond oppositely to shape changes. This extends to many-level systems, where the thermally averaged level spacing and ground-state energy evolve in opposite directions. We construct spontaneity maps revealing energy- and entropy-driven spontaneous processes. These behaviors emerge under quasistatic, isothermal deformations and show how geometry alone can induce thermodynamic effects typically exclusive to interacting or open systems. Our results offer a broadly applicable route to spectral gap control in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving emerges as a valuable technique for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, enhancing quantum technology applications. In this context, counterdiabatic quantum computing represents a new paradigm with the potential to achieve quantum advantage for industrial problems. This work investigates the production of quantum coherence in adiabatic evolution accelerated by counterdiabatic driving within the framework of counterdiabatic quantum computing. Specifically, we analyze different orders in the nested commutator expansion for approximated counterdiabatic drivings for three cases: a weighted max-cut problem, a 4-local Hamiltonian, and a non-stoquastic Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that the hierarchy introduced by coherence production correlates with the success probability in the impulse regime. This suggests that protocols increasing coherence during evolution enhance performance in adiabatic evolution driven by counterdiabatic techniques. We show that large quantum coherence also means large energy fluctuation during evolution, which is associated with the speed of evolution, paving the way for designing superior algorithms in counterdiabatic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Near-Term Pseudorandom and Pseudoresource Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pseudorandom quantum state (PRS) is an ensemble of quantum states indistinguishable from Haar-random states to observers with efficient quantum computers. It allows one to substitute the costly Haar-random state with efficiently preparable PRS as a resource for cryptographic protocols, while also finding applications in quantum learning theory, black hole physics, many-body thermalization, quantum foundations, and quantum chaos. All existing constructions of PRS equate the notion of efficiency to quantum computers which runtime is bounded by a polynomial in its input size. In this work, we relax the notion of efficiency for PRS with respect to observers with near-term quantum computers implementing algorithms with runtime that scales slower than polynomial-time. We introduce the $\mathbf{T}$-PRS which is indistinguishable to quantum algorithms with runtime $\mathbf{T}(n)$ that grows slower than polynomials in the input size $n$. We give a set of reasonable conditions that a $\mathbf{T}$-PRS must satisfy and give two constructions by using quantum-secure pseudorandom functions and pseudorandom functions. For $\mathbf{T}(n)$ being linearithmic, linear, polylogarithmic, and logarithmic function, we characterize the amount of quantum resources a $\mathbf{T}$-PRS must possess, particularly on its coherence, entanglement, and magic. Our quantum resource characterization applies generally to any two state ensembles that are indistinguishable to observers with computational power $\mathbf{T}(n)$, giving a general necessary condition of whether a low-resource ensemble can mimic a high-resource ensemble, forming a $\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair. We demonstate how the necessary amount of resource decreases as the observer's computational power is more restricted, giving a $\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair with larger resource gap for more computationally limited observers.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization of Adversarially Trained Quantum Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate their input classical or quantum data. A promising countermeasure is adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as $1/\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding. For quantum binary classifiers employing \textit{rotation embedding}, we find that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\mathbf{x}$, the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\mathbf{x}$. In contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction with Girth-16 Non-Binary LDPC Codes via Affine Permutation Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on non-binary low-density parity-check codes with girth 16. In conventional constructions using circulant permutation matrices, the girth is upper-bounded by 12, which limits the suppression of harmful short cycles. Our construction employs affine permutation matrices and a randomized sequential selection procedure designed to eliminate short cycles, which are known to limit decoding performance.
  Joint belief propagation decoding is applied over depolarizing channels. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed codes reduce the number of low-weight codewords in $C_X \setminus C_Z^\perp$ and $C_Z \setminus C_X^\perp$, and thus have the potential to suppress error floors. In addition, we obtain a significantly improved upper bound on the minimum distance, which we conjecture to be tight.</description>

      <title>Scientific Spirit of Chien-Shiung Wu: From Quantum Entanglement to Parity Nonconservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1950, Chien-Shiung Wu and her student published a coincidence experiment on entangled photon pairs that were created in electron-positron annihilation. This experiment precisely verified the prediction of quantum electrodynamics. Additionally, it was also the first instance of a precisely controlled quantum entangled state of spatially separated particles, although Wu did not know about this at the time. In 1956, Wu initiated and led the so-called Wu experiment, which discovered parity nonconservation, becoming one of the greatest experiments of the 20th century. As Chen Ning Yang said, Wu's experiments were well known for their precision and accuracy. Experimental precision and accuracy manifested Wu's scientific spirit, which we investigate here in some detail. This paper is the translated transcript of the speech the author made at the International Symposium Commemorating the 110th Anniversary of the Birth of Chien-Shiung Wu, on May 31, 2022. The above abstract is the translation of the original abstract of the speech.</description>

      <title>Stamps of state on structure: Probing the state of ultralight dark matter via its density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) candidates with very small masses, and correspondingly large number densities, have gained significant interest in recent years. These DM candidates are typically said to behave "classically". More specifically, they are often assumed to reside in an ensemble of coherent states. One notable exception to this scenario is when isocurvature fluctuations of the DM are produced during inflation (or more generally by any Bogoliubov transformation). In such contexts, the ultralight DM instead resides in a squeezed state. In this work, we demonstrate that these two scenarios can be distinguished via the statistics of the DM density fluctuations, such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. This provides a probe of the DM state which persists in the limit of large particle number and does not rely on any non-gravitational interactions of the DM. Importantly, the statistics of these two states differ when the modes of the squeezed state are all in-phase, as is the case at the end of inflation. Later cosmological dynamics may affect this configuration. Our work motivates future numerical studies of how cosmological dynamics may impact the initial squeezed state and the statistics of its density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Bosonic vs. Fermionic Matter in Quantum Simulations of $2+1$D Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum link models extend lattice gauge theories beyond the traditional Wilson formulation and present promising candidates for both digital and analog quantum simulations. Fermionic matter coupled to $U(1)$ quantum link gauge fields has been extensively studied, revealing a phase diagram that includes transitions from the columnar phase in the quantum dimer model to the resonating valence bond phase in the quantum link model, potentially passing through a disordered liquid-like phase. In this study, we investigate the model coupled to hardcore bosons and identify a similar phase structure, though with a more intricate mixture of phases around the transition. Our analysis reveals that near the transition region, a narrow and distinct ordered phase emerges, characterized by gauge fields forming plaquette configurations with alternating orientations, which is then followed by a thinner, liquid-like regime. This complexity primarily stems from the differences in particle statistics, which manifest prominently when the matter degrees of freedom become dynamic. Notably, our findings suggest that bosons can effectively replace fermions in lattice gauge theory simulations, offering solutions to the challenges posed by fermions in both digital and analog quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian phase transitions on a generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the emergence of non-Hermitian phase transitions on a quantum wormhole surface. We consider a single fermion whose dynamics are governed by the Dirac equation confined to move on a quantum wormhole surface. The effects of the geometry are taken into account using the tetrad formalism and the spin connection. The Dirac equation gives rise to two coupled first-order differential equations for each spinor component. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for each spinor component are computed numerically, and the non-Hermitian phase transitions are investigated in terms of the geometric features of the wormhole and the magnitude of the imaginary component of the mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate engineering of a narrow microwave transition between trappable states in radio-frequency-dressed $^{87}$rubidium, reducing the static field dependence. A single-frequency, off-resonant microwave field allows for the suppression of the differential Zeeman shift arising from the nuclear magnetic moment to at least first order. The field dependence can be suppressed further with additional dressing fields, which we demonstrate experimentally with two microwave frequencies. The engineered transition can thus be used in a range of cold atom schemes that rely on coherent state superpositions.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>

Abstract: These lectures present a brief introduction to measurement theory for QFT in possibly curved spacetimes introduced by the author and R. Verch [Comm. Math. Phys. 378 (2020) 851-889]. Topics include: a brief introduction to algebraic QFT, measurement schemes in QFT, state updates, multiple measurements and the resolution of Sorkin's "impossible measurement" problem. Examples using suitable theories based on Green hyperbolic operators are given, and the interpretational significance of the framework is briefly considered. The basic style is to give details relating to QFT while taking for granted various facts from the theory of globally hyperbolic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent GW via conservation of spectral moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand on a recently introduced alternate framework for $GW$ simulation of charged excitations [Scott et. al., J. Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based around the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW self-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule, finding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a description of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of CO$_2$ chemisorption in an amine-functionalized metal-organic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a series of calculations using simulated QPUs, accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, focusing on a molecular analog of an amine-functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF) -- a promising class of materials for CO2 capture. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique is employed, utilizing the unitary coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (UCCSD) within active spaces extracted from the larger material system. We explore active spaces of (6e,6o), (10e,10o), and (12e,12o), corresponding to 12, 20, and 24 qubits, respectively, and simulate them using CUDA-Q's GPU-accelerated state-vector simulator. Notably, the 24-qubit simulations -- among the largest of their kind to date -- are enabled by gate fusion optimizations available in CUDA-Q. While these active space sizes are among the largest reported in the context of CO2 chemisorption, they remain insufficient for a fully accurate study of the system. This limitation arises from necessary simplifications and scalability challenges of VQE, particularly the barren plateau problem. Nonetheless, this work demonstrates the application of VQE to a novel material system using large-scale simulated QPUs and offers a blueprint for future quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation for almost-bosonic anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the $N$-body Hamiltonian describing the microscopic structure of a quantum gas of almost-bosonic anyons. This description includes both extended magnetic flux and spin-orbit/soft-disk interaction between the particles which are confined in a scalar trapping potential. We study a physically well-motivated ansatz for a sequence of trial states, consisting of Jastrow repulsive short-range correlations and a condensate, with sufficient variational freedom to approximate the ground state (and possibly also low-energy excited states) of the gas. In the limit $N \to \infty$, while taking the relative size of the anyons to zero and the total magnetic flux $2\pi\beta$ to remain finite, we rigorously derive the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger/average-field-Pauli effective energy density functional for the condensate wave function. This includes a scalar self-interaction parameter $\gamma$ which depends both on $\beta$, the diluteness of the gas, and the spin-orbit coupling strength $g$, but becomes independent of these microscopic details for a particular value of the coupling $g=2$ in which supersymmetry is exhibited (on all scales, both microscopic and mesoscopic) with $\gamma=2\pi|\beta|$. Our findings confirm and clarify the predictions we have found in the physics literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a graphene Josephson junction where the inner graphene layer is subjected to spin-orbit coupling by proximity effect. This could be achieved, for example, by growing the graphene layer on top of a transition metal dichalcogenide, such as WS$_2$. Here, we focus on the ballistic, wide, and short junction limits and study the effects of the spin-orbit interaction on the supercurrent. In particular, we analyze the current phase relation using an analytical approach based on the continuum model. We find combinations of types of spin-orbit coupling that significantly suppress the supercurrent by opening a gap in the graphene band structure. At the same time, other combinations enhance it, acting as an effective spin-valley resolved chemical potential. Moreover, we find that a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling leads to a junction with a highly voltage tunable harmonic content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics in ensembles of positionally disordered interacting quantum spins based on the statistical properties, such as mean and variance, of the underlying disorder distribution. Our framework is validated through extensive exact numerical calculations and we use it to disentangle and understand the importance of dimensionality and interaction range for the observation of glassy (i.e., sub-exponential) decay dynamics. Leveraging the deterministic control of qubit positioning enabled by modern tweezer array architectures, we also introduce a method (``J-mapping'') that can be used to emulate the relaxation dynamics of a disordered system with arbitrary dimensionality and interaction range in bespoke one-dimensional arrays. Our approach paves the way towards tunable relaxation dynamics that can be explored in quantum simulators based on arrays of neutral atoms and molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model for a transversally driven Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity. We focus on the interplay between different coherent couplings, which can trigger a structural phase transition, known as the superradiant phase transition. Our approach, based on band structure theory and a mean-field description, enables a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the system's excited modes, precursing the phase transitions. By incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find non-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model allows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the cavity deviating from $90^\circ$. This offers us a unified perspective on the plethora of different implementations of such systems.</description>

Abstract: Driven-dissipative quantum systems can undergo transitions from stationary to dynamical phases, reflecting the emergence of collective non-equilibrium behavior. We study such a transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity and develop a cavity-assisted Bragg spectroscopy technique to resolve its collective modes. We observe dissipation-induced synchronization at the quasiparticle level, where two roton-like modes coalesce at an exceptional point. This reveals how dissipation microscopically drives collective dynamics and signals a precursor to a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical memories: Simulating quantum LDPC codes with local gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant-rate low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are promising candidates for constructing efficient fault-tolerant quantum memories. However, if physical gates are subject to geometric-locality constraints, it becomes challenging to realize these codes. In this paper, we construct a new family of $[[N,K,D]]$ codes, referred to as hierarchical codes, that encode a number of logical qubits $K = \Omega(N/\log(N)^2)$. The N-th element of this code family is obtained by concatenating a constant-rate quantum LDPC code with a surface code; nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions are sufficient to implement the corresponding syndrome-extraction circuit and achieve a threshold. Below threshold the logical failure rate vanishes superpolynomially as a function of the distance $D(N)$. We present a bilayer architecture for implementing the syndrome-extraction circuit, and estimate the logical failure rate for this architecture. Under conservative assumptions, we find that the hierarchical code outperforms the basic encoding where all logical qubits are encoded in the surface code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is a constrained combinatorial optimization problem that is generally considered a complex computational problem. In this paper, we first present a binary encoding of MSA and devise a corresponding soft-constrained cost-function that enables a Hamiltonian formulation and implementation of the MSA problem with the variational Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Through theoretical analysis, a bound on the ratio of the number of feasible states to the size of the Hilbert space is determined. Furthermore, we consider a small instance of our QAOA-MSA algorithm in both a quantum simulator and its performance on an actual quantum computer. While the ideal solution to the instance of MSA investigated is shown to be the most probable state sampled for a shallow p&lt;5 quantum circuit in the simulation, the level of noise in current devices is still a formidable challenge for the kind of MSA-QAOA algorithm developed here. In turn, we are not able to distinguish the feasible solutions from other states in the quantum hardware output data at this point. This indicates a need for further investigation into both the strategy utilized for compiling the quantum circuit, but also the possibility of devising a more compact ansatz, as one might achieve through constraint-preserving mixers for QAOA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum repeater protocol for distributing entanglement over long distances, where a dedicated communication stage enables trial rates not limited by the travel time between repeater nodes. To accomplish this, each node contains several qubits that can couple to one single-photon emitter. Photons from the emitters generate heralded entanglement between qubits in neighboring nodes. The protocol leaves the emitters disentangled from the rest of the system immediately after emitting the photons, thus allowing them to be reused to entangle other qubits without waiting for the repeater link round-trip time. This time multiplexing increases the protocol trial rate by up to an order of magnitude. The protocol is then combined with conventional deterministic entanglement swapping and heralded entanglement purification to extend the entanglement distance and reduce the entanglement error, respectively. We perform a complete protocol analysis by considering all relevant error sources, such as initialization, two-qubit gate, and qubit measurement errors, as well as the exponential decoherence of the qubits with time. The latter is particularly important since we analyze the protocol performance for a broad range of experimental parameters and obtain secret key rates ranging from $1 \rightarrow 1000$ Hz at a distance of $1000$ km. Our results suggest that it is important to reach a qubit memory coherence time of around one second, and two-qubit gate and measurement errors in the order of $10^{-3}$ to obtain reasonable secret key rates over distances longer than achievable with direct transmission. While this work focuses on optimizing secret key rates, the protocol can also be used for EPR pair generation and is thus also relevant for, e.g., distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16570v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-copy activation of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a phenomenon whereby multiple copies of biseparable but fully inseparable states can exhibit GME. This was shown to be generically possible in finite dimensions. Here, we extend this analysis to infinite dimensions. We provide examples of GME-activatable non-Gaussian states. For Gaussian states, we apply a necessary biseparability criterion for the covariance matrix and show that it cannot detect GME activation. We further identify fully inseparable Gaussian states that satisfy the criterion but show that multiple and, in some cases, even single copies are GME. Thus, we show that the covariance-matrix biseparability criterion is not sufficient even for Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Identification is Pointless: Quantum Coordinates, Localisation of Events, and the Quantum Hole Argument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of quantum reference frames (QRFs) is motivated by the idea of taking into account the quantum properties of the reference frames used, explicitly or implicitly, in our description of physical systems. Like classical reference frames, QRFs can be used to define physical quantities relationally. Unlike their classical analogue, they relativise the notions of superposition and entanglement. Here, we explain this feature by examining how configurations or locations are identified across different branches in superposition. We show that, in the presence of symmetries, whether a system is in "the same" or "different" configurations across the branches depends on the choice of QRF. Hence, sameness and difference -- and thus superposition and entanglement -- lose their absolute meaning. We apply these ideas to the context of semi-classical spacetimes in superposition and use coincidences of four scalar fields to construct a comparison map between spacetime points in the different branches. This reveals that the localisation of an event is frame-dependent. We discuss the implications for indefinite causal order and the locality of interaction and conclude with a generalisation of Einstein's hole argument to the quantum context.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Quantum Subspace Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this approach can be substantially alleviated in a parameter-free way.</description>

      <title>Classifying Density Matrices of 2 and 3 Qubit States Up To LU Equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a modified version of the proof given Jing-Yang-Zhao's paper titled "Local Unitary Equivalence of Quantum States and Simultaneous Orthogonal Equivalence," which established the correspondance between local unitary equivalence and simultaneous orthogonal equivalence of $2$-qubits. Our modified proof utilizes a hypermatrix algebra framework, and through this framework we are able to generalize this correspondence to $3$-qubits. Finally, we apply a generalization of Specht's criterion (first proved in "Specht's Criterion for Systems of Linear Mappings" by V. Futorney, R. A. Horn, and V. V. Sergeichuk) to reduce the problem of local unitary equivalence of $3$-qubits to checking trace identities and a few other easy-to-check properties. We also note that all of these results can be extended to $2$ and $3$ qudits if we relax the notion of LU equivalence to quasi-LU equivalence, as defined in the aforementioned paper by Jing et. al.</description>

      <title>Causal and Non-Causal Revivals of Information: A New Regime of Non-Markovianity in Quantum Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of information revivals, witnessing the violation of certain data-processing inequalities, has provided an important paradigm in the study of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes. Although often used interchangeably, we argue here that the notions of ``revivals'' and ``backflows'', i.e., flows of information from the environment back into the system, are distinct: an information revival can occur without any backflow ever taking place. In this paper, we examine in detail the phenomenon of non-causal revivals and relate them to the theory of short Markov chains and squashed non-Markovianity. We also provide an operational condition, in terms of system-only degrees of freedom, to witness the presence of genuine backflow that cannot be explained by non-causal revivals. As a byproduct, we demonstrate that focusing on processes with genuine backflows, while excluding those with only non-causal revivals, resolves the issue of non-convexity of Markovianity, thus enabling the construction of a convex resource theory of genuine quantum non-Markovianity.</description>

Abstract: Bound entanglement is a special form of quantum entanglement that cannot be used for distillation, i.e., the local transformation of copies of arbitrarily entangled states into a smaller number of approximately maximally entangled states. Implying an inherent irreversibility of quantum resources, this phenomenon highlights the gaps in our current theory of entanglement. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the key findings on bipartite bound entanglement. We focus on systems of finite dimensions, an area of high relevance for many quantum information processing tasks. We elucidate the properties of bound entanglement and its interconnections with various facets of quantum information theory and quantum information processing. The article illuminates areas where our understanding of bound entangled states, particularly their detection and characterization, is yet to be fully developed. By highlighting the need for further research into this phenomenon and underscoring relevant open questions, this article invites researchers to unravel its relevance for our understanding of entanglement in Nature and how this resource can most effectively be used for applications in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Pauli path simulations of noisy quantum circuits beyond average case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For random quantum circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $\Theta(\log n)$ with depolarizing noise, the task of sampling from the output state can be efficiently performed classically using a Pauli path method [Aharonov et al. Proceedings of the 55th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. 2023] . This paper aims to study the performance of this method beyond random circuits. We first consider the classical simulation of local observables in circuits composed of Clifford and T gates $\unicode{x2013}$ going beyond the average case analysis, we derive sufficient conditions for simulatability in terms of the noise rate and the fraction of gates that are T gates, and show that if noise is introduced at a faster rate than T gates, the simulation becomes classically easy. As an application of this result, we study 2D QAOA circuits that attempt to find low-energy states of classical Ising models on general graphs. There, our results shows that for hard instances of the problem, which correspond to Ising model's graph being geometrically non-local, a QAOA algorithm mapped to a geometrically local circuit architecture using SWAP gates does not have any asymptotic advantage over classical algorithms if depolarized at a constant rate. Finally, we illustrate instances where the Pauli path method fails to give the correct result, and also initiate a study of the trade-off between fragility to noise and classical complexity of simulating a given quantum circuit.</description>

Abstract: We propose a class of metrological resource states whose quantum Fisher information scales optimally in both system size and noise rate. In these states, qubits are partitioned into sensing groups with relatively large correlations within a group but small correlations between groups. The states are obtainable from local Hamiltonian evolution, and we design a metrologically optimal and efficient measurement protocol utilizing time-reversed dynamics and single-qubit on-site measurements. Using quantum domino dynamics, we also present a protocol free of the time-reversal step that has an estimation error roughly twice the best possible value. Finally, we show that spin squeezed states are also optimal for noisy metrology under general conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic characterisation of when a quantum spin model admits an exact solution via a mapping to free parafermions. Our characterisation is based on the concept of a frustration graph, which represents the commutation relations between Weyl operators of a Hamiltonian. We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.</description>

      <title>Code switching revisited: Low-overhead magic state preparation using color codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to prepare a high-fidelity magic state on a two-dimensional (2D) color code using a three-dimensional (3D) color code. Our method modifies the known code switching protocol with (i) a recently discovered transversal gate between the 2D and the 3D code and (ii) a judicious use of flag-based postselection. We numerically demonstrate that these modifications lead to a significant improvement in the fidelity of the magic state. For instance, subjected to a uniform circuit-level noise of $10^{-3}$ (excluding idling noise), our code switching protocol yields a magic state encoded in the distance-$3$ 2D color code with a logical infidelity of $4.6\times 10^{-5}\pm 1.6 \times 10^{-5}$ (quantified by an error-corrected logical state tomography) with an $84\%$ of acceptance rate. Used in conjunction with a postselection approach, extrapolation from a polynomial fit suggests a fidelity improvement to $5.1 \times 10^{-7}$ for the same code. Our protocol is aimed for architectures that allow nonlocal connectivity and should be readily implementable in near-term devices. Finally, we also present a simulation technique akin to an extended stabilizer simulator which effectively incorporates the non-Clifford $T$-gate, that permits to simulate the protocol without resorting to a resource intensive state-vector simulation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum repeaters have promised efficient scaling of quantum networks for over two decades. Despite numerous platforms proclaiming functional repeaters, the realization of large-scale networks remains elusive, indicating that the resources required to do so were thus far underestimated. Here, we investigate the dependence of resource scaling of networks on realistic experimental errors. Using a nested repeater protocol based on the purification protocol by Bennett et. al., we provide an analytical approximation of the polynomial degree of the resources consumed by entanglement routing. Our error model predicts substantially stricter thresholds for efficient network operation than previously suggested, requiring two-qubit gate errors below 1.3% for resource scaling with polynomial degree below 10. The analytical model presented here provides insight into the reason why previous experimental implementations of quantum repeaters failed to scale efficiently and inform the development of truly scalable systems, highlighting the need for high-fidelity local two-qubit gates. We employ our analytical approximation of the scaling exponent as a figure of merit to compare different platforms and find that trapped ions and color centers in diamond currently provide the best route towards large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Perfect State Transfer in Spin Chains via Parametrization of On-Site Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Monogamy of Entanglement Bounds and Improved Approximation Algorithms for Qudit Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new monogamy of entanglement bounds for two-local qudit Hamiltonians of rank-one projectors without one-local terms. In particular, we certify the ground state energy in terms of the maximum matching of the underlying interaction graph via low-degree sum-of-squares proofs. Algorithmically, we show that a simple matching-based algorithm approximates the ground state energy to at least $1/d$ for general graphs and to at least $1/d + \Theta(1/D)$ for graphs with bounded degree, $D$. This outperforms random assignment, which, in expectation, achieves energy of only $1/d^2$ of the ground state energy for general graphs. Notably, on $D$-regular graphs with degree, $D \leq 5$, and for any local dimension, $d$, we show that this simple matching-based algorithm has an approximation guarantee of $1/2$. Lastly, when $d=2$, we present an algorithm achieving an approximation guarantee of $0.595$, beating that of [PT22, arXiv:2206.08342] (which gave a tight approximation guarantee of $1/2$).</description>

      <title>Exponential Separations between Quantum Learning with and without Purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum learning tasks, quantum memory can offer exponential reductions in statistical complexity compared to any single-copy strategies, but this typically necessitates at least doubling the system size. We show that such exponential reductions can also be achieved by having access to the purification of the target mixed state. Specifically, for a low-rank mixed state, only a constant number of ancilla qubits is needed for estimating properties related to its purity, cooled form, principal component and quantum Fisher information with constant sample complexity, which utilizes single-copy measurements on the purification. Without access to the purification, we prove that these tasks require exponentially many copies of the target mixed state for any strategies utilizing a bounded number of ancilla qubits, even with the knowledge of the target state's rank. Our findings also lead to practical applications in areas such as quantum cryptography. With further discussions about the source and extent of the advantages brought by purification, our work uncovers a new resource with significant potential for quantum learning and other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how to use quantum linear algebra to simulate a physically realistic model of disordered non-interacting electrons. The physics of disordered electrons outside of one dimension challenges classical computation due to the critical nature of the Anderson localization transition or the presence of large localization lengths, while the atypical distribution of the local density of states limits the power of disorder averaged approaches. Starting from the block-encoding of a disordered non-interacting Hamiltonian, we describe how to simulate key physical quantities, including the reduced density matrix, Green's function, and local density of states, as well as bulk-averaged observables such as the linear conductivity, using the quantum singular value transformation, quantum amplitude estimation, and trace estimation. We further discuss a quantum advantage that scales polynomially with system size and exponentially with lattice dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple argument to derive the transformation of quantum stochastic calculus formalism between inertial observers, and derive the quantum open system dynamics for a system moving in a vacuum (more generally coherent) quantum field under the usual Markov approximation. We argue that for uniformly accelerated open systems, however, the formalism must breakdown as we move from a Fock representation over the algebra of field observables over all Minkowski space to the restriction to the algebra of observables over a Rindler wedge. This leads to quantum noise having a unitarily inequivalent non-Fock representation - in particular, the latter is a thermal representation at the Unruh temperature. The unitary inequivalence ultimately being a consequence of the underlying flat noise spectrum approximation for the fundamental quantum stochastic processes. We derive the quantum stochastic limit for a uniformly accelerated (two-level) detector and establish an open systems description of the relaxation to thermal equilibrium at the Unruh temperature.er is a thermal representation at the Unruh temperature. The unitary inequivalence ultimately being a consequence of the underlying flat noise spectrum approximation for the fundamental quantum stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Floquet driven long-range interactions induce super-extensive scaling in quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in energy storage and power extraction is a primary objective in the design of quantum-based batteries. We explore how long-range (LR) interactions in conjunction with Floquet driving can improve the performance of quantum batteries, particularly when the battery is initialized in a fully polarized state. In particular, we analytically prove that the upper bound of the instantaneous power obtained through this system-charger duo scales quadratically with moderate system-size. By optimizing the driving frequency, we demonstrate that the maximum average power which is a lower bound of the instantaneous power can achieve the super-extensive scaling with system-size, thereby providing genuine quantum advantage. Further, we illustrate that the inclusion of either two-body or many-body interaction terms in the LR charging Hamiltonian leads to a scaling benefit. We also discover that a super-linear scaling in power results from increasing the strength of interaction compared to the transverse magnetic field and the range of interaction with low fall-off rate, highlighting the advantageous role of long-range interactions in optimizing quantum battery charging.</description>

      <title>The surface code beyond Pauli channels: Logical noise coherence, information-theoretic measures, and errorfield-double phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large-scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Secure Quantum Key Distribution Using a Room-Temperature Quantum Emitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-demand generation of single photons from solid-state quantum emitters is essential to build practical quantum networks and QKD systems by potentially enabling higher secure key rates (SKR) and lower quantum bit error rates (QBER) in short-range distances. Room-temperature operation is particularly important as it eliminates the need for bulky cryogenic setups, reducing complexity and cost for real-world applications. In this work, we showcase the versatility of defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) at room temperature by implementing the B92 protocol. Our experiments yield a sifted key rate (SiKR) of 17.5 kbps with a QBER of 6.49% at a dynamic polarization encoding rate of 40 MHz, and finite-key analysis provides a SKR of 7 kbps, one of the highest achieved for a room-temperature single photon source. We analyzed the non-decoy efficient BB84 using our hBN emitter and other promising quantum dot source for QKD, and compare their key performance with a single quantum repeater scenario. We also explore potential applications of hBN defects beyond QKD and analyze scenarios that could outperform conventional point-to-point QKD schemes. These results underscore the promise of hBN emitters for advancing quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>A quantum speedup algorithm for TSP based on quantum dynamic programming with very few qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08853v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard problem that plays a crucial role in combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we are interested in the quantum search framework for the TSP because it has robust theoretical guarantees. However, we need to first search for all Hamiltonian cycles from a very large solution space, which greatly weakens the advantage of quantum search algorithms. To address this issue, one can first prepare a superposition state of all feasible solutions, and then amplify the amplitude of the optimal solution from it. We propose a quantum algorithm to generate the uniform superposition state of all N-length Hamiltonian cycles as an initial state within polynomial gate complexity based on pure quantum dynamic programming with very few ancillary qubits, which achieves exponential acceleration compared to the previous initial state preparation algorithm. As a result, we realized the theoretical minimum query complexity of quantum search algorithms for a general TSP. Compared to some algorithms that theoretically have lower query complexities but lack practical implementation solutions, our algorithm has feasible circuit implementation. Our work provides a meaningful research case on how to fully utilize the structures of specific problems to unleash the acceleration capability of the quantum search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method that generates ground-state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables and correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Shor algorithm for discrete logarithm problems with comprehensive pairs of modulo p and order q</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over finite fields, commonly used in classical cryptography, has no known polynomial-time algorithm on classical computers. However, Shor has provided its polynomial-time algorithm on quantum computers. Nevertheless, there are only few examples simulating quantum circuits that operate on general pairs of modulo $p$ and order $q$. In this paper, we constructed such quantum circuits and solved DLPs for all 1,860 possible pairs of $p$ and $q$ up to 32 qubits using a quantum simulator with PRIMEHPC FX700. From this, we obtained and verified values of the success probabilities, which had previously been heuristically analyzed by Eker\r{a}. As a result, the detailed waveform shape of the success probability of Shor's algorithm for solving the DLP, known as a periodic function of order $q$, was clarified. Additionally, we generated 1,015 quantum circuits for larger pairs of $p$ and $q$, extrapolated the circuit sizes obtained, and compared them for $p=2048$ bits between safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups. While in classical cryptography, the cipher strength of safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups is the same if $p$ is equal, we quantitatively demonstrated how much the strength of the latter decreases to the bit length of $p$ in the former when using Shor's quantum algorithm. In particular, it was experimentally and theoretically shown that when a ripple carry adder is used in the addition circuit, the cryptographic strength of a Schnorr group with $p=2048$ bits under Shor's algorithm is almost equivalent to that of a safe-prime group with $p=1024$ bits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum statistics dictate how particles exchange and correlate-but in two-dimensional systems, these rules extend beyond bosons and fermions to anyons, quasiparticles with continuously tunable exchange phases. Here, we develop a Lindblad framework for anyonic oscillators and show that fractional statistics enable statistical control of decoherence in open quantum systems. By varying the anyonic phase and environmental correlations, we demonstrate tunable mode protection, identify exceptional points in the dissipative spectrum, and reveal temperature-dependent coherence bifurcations. Using coherent multidimensional spectroscopy as a probe, we show that statistical phases leave distinct fingerprints in the third-order response, opening new routes to detect and manipulate topological excitations. These results establish the exchange phase as a functional control parameter for engineering dissipation-resilient quantum states.</description>

Abstract: When excited states decay the time evolution operator $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$ does not obey $U^{\dagger}(t)U(t)=I$. Nonetheless, probability conservation is not lost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different form. Specifically, if the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian is complete, then due to $CPT$ symmetry, a symmetry that holds for all physical systems, there must exist an operator $V$ that effects $VHV^{-1}=H^{\dagger}$, so that $V^{-1}U^{\dagger}(t)VU(t)=I$. In consequence, the time delay associated with decay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation. Thus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from the excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all.</description>

      <title>Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with asymmetric sources</title>

Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which eliminates all the attacks from the eavesdropper to the measurement party, has been one of the most promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the performance when any two MDI users in networks communicates using asymmetric sources in distinct single or multiple temporal modes. As a specific application, we model to obtain the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare the performance to the cases with symmetric (i.e. identical) sources. The result demonstrates that the actual performance does not degrade due to the asymmetry of sources. In contrary, it maintains at a good level over the entire distance we study. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources, and thus paving the way for the practical deployment of completely asymmetric MDI-QKD networks.</description>

      <title>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferromagnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states and recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>

Abstract: Daniel McNulty et.al (2024 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. submitted) voiced suspicions to the Lemma 11(v) Part 6 in Chen and Yu (2017 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50 475304) and three theorems derived in later publications (Liang et al 2019 Quantum Inf. Process. 18 352; Liang et al 2019 Linear Multilinear Algebra 69 2908-25; Chen et al 2021 Quantum Inf. Process. 20 353). For these suspicions, we reprove that any complex Hadamard matrix of order-six whose number of real elements more than 22 does not belong to a set of four mutually unbiased bases. We show that the number of complex Hadamard submatrices of order-two of any H2-reducible matrix is not 10,...,16,18. We also put forward some possible directions for further development.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Sampling Random Spanning Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for sampling random spanning trees from a weighted graph in $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{mn})$ time, where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Our algorithm has sublinear runtime for dense graphs and achieves a quantum speedup over the best-known classical algorithm, which runs in $\widetilde{O}(m)$ time. The approach carefully combines, on one hand, a classical method based on ``large-step'' random walks for reduced mixing time and, on the other hand, quantum algorithmic techniques, including quantum graph sparsification and a sampling-without-replacement variant of Hamoudi's multiple-state preparation. We also establish a matching lower bound, proving the optimality of our algorithm up to polylogarithmic factors. These results highlight the potential of quantum computing in accelerating fundamental graph sampling problems.</description>

      <title>Pareto-optimality of pulses for robust population transfer in a ladder-type qutrit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-modulation schemes have recently emerged as alternatives to standard Rabi pulses for realizing robust quantum operations. In this work, we investigate short-duration population transfer between the ground and first excited states of a ladder-type qutrit, with the goal of minimizing leakage into the second excited state. Our multiobjective approach seeks to reduce the maximum transient second-state population and maximize detuning robustness. Inspired by two-state models, such as the Allen-Eberly and Hioe-Carroll models, we extend these concepts to our system, exploring a range of pulse families, including those with super-Gaussian envelopes and polynomial detuning functions. We identify Pareto fronts for pulse models constructed from one of two envelope functions paired with one of four detuning functions. We then analyze how each Pareto-optimal pulse parameter influences the two Pareto objectives and amplitude robustness.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of strong coupling Bose polarons: From repulsive polarons to non-Gaussian many-body bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the Bose polaron problem of a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a host Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through a Feshbach resonance. On the repulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct polaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it remains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges resulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing) impurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson interactions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary theoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that combines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states, including up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact non-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state. This variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities arising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced instability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in a discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies between the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit strong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum correlations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their characterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable molecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques. This work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Effective Equilibrium Theory of Quantum Light-Matter Interaction in Cavities: Extended Systems and the Long Wavelength Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When light and matter interact strongly, the resulting hybrid system inherits properties from both constituents, allowing one to modify material behavior by engineering the surrounding electromagnetic environment. This concept underlies the emerging paradigm of cavity materials engineering, which aims at the control of material properties via tailored vacuum fluctuations of dark photonic environments. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging due to the combined complexity of extended electronic states and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here, we derive an effective, non-perturbative theory for low-dimensional crystals embedded in a Fabry-P\'erot resonator, within the long-wavelength limit. Our approach incorporates the multimode and dispersive nature of the cavity field and reduces it to an effective single-mode description by imposing the condition of negligible momentum transfer from light to matter. Importantly, the resulting effective mode is characterized by a finite mode volume-even in the limit of extended cavities-which is directly linked to realistic cavity parameters. This ensures that the light-matter coupling remains finite in bulk systems. By explicitly accounting for the finite reflectivity of cavity mirrors, our theory also avoids double counting the contribution from free-space light-matter coupling. Overall, our results provide a robust and realistic framework for describing cavity-matter interactions at the Hamiltonian level, incorporating the electromagnetic environment beyond the idealized perfect-mirror approximation.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement and Bell non-locality in loop-induced Higgs boson decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum entanglement properties of the three-body $H\to\gamma l\bar{l}$ decays (for $l=e,\mu,\tau$) within the context of the Standard Model augmented with CP-violating interactions in the lepton Yukawa sector. Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry plays a significant role in scientific research and technological applications. While position-momentum phase-space squeezing has been demonstrated to increase the coherence of atom sources by reducing momentum spread, we theoretically investigate the potential advantages of the opposite squeezing. As a case study, we analytically and numerically examine its effect on point source atom interferometry (PSI) for rotation sensing. Our analysis reveals that this squeezed PSI (SPSI) approach can significantly improve sensitivity and dynamic range while enabling shorter cycle times and higher repetition rates. Through simulations, we identify parameter spaces where sensitivity and dynamic range are enhanced by orders of magnitude. Under a specific definition of compactness, our calculations show that SPSI outperforms standard PSI by over four orders of magnitude. These theoretical findings suggest that SPSI could either enhance performance in standard-sized devices or maintain performance in miniaturized chip-scale devices, potentially paving the way for new practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to investigate spin chirality in molecular quantum systems. Focusing on a minimal three-spin-center model with antiferromagnetic exchange and symmetry breaking driven by an electric-field-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and applied magnetic fields-give rise to chiral ground states characterized by nonzero scalar spin chirality, $\chi = \textbf{S}_1\cdot(\textbf{S}_r\times \textbf{S}_2)$. The emergent chiral qubits naturally suppress always-on interactions that can not be switched off in weakly coupled qubits, as demonstrated through Liouville-von Neumann dynamics, which reveal phase difference in superposition states that form chiral qubits. To validate this framework, we examine realistic lanthanide complexes with radical-bridged magnetic centers, where spin-orbit coupling and asymmetric exchange facilitate chirality. Our findings establish spin chirality engineering as a promising strategy for mitigating always-on interaction in entangling two chiral qubits in molecular quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We review the formulation of a Lorentz-covariant bispinorial wave function and wave equation for a single photon on a flat background. We show the existence of a 10-dimensional set of conservation laws for this equation, and prove that 8 of these can be used to obtain global, gauge-invariant, ADM-like quantities that together define a covariantly constant self-dual bispinor.</description>

      <title>Time delay of mean field interaction in thermal Rydberg atomic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean field theory is commonly employed to study nonequilibrium dynamics in hot Rydberg atomic ensembles, but the fundamental mechanism behind the generation of the mean-field interactions remains poorly understood. In this work, we experimentally observe a time-delay effect in the buildup of mean-field interaction, which reveals the key role of collision ionization. We analyze the relevant collision channels and propose a microscopic mechanism that quantitatively explains the hysteresis window observed in optical bistability. Then, using square-wave modulation spectroscopy (SMS) to monitor the growth of the mean-field interaction, we experimentally demonstrate a delay in its dynamical buildup following the initial Rydberg excitation. Finally, we demonstrate how this delay effect may help understand the recently observed self-sustained oscillations in thermal Rydberg gases. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the contribution of ionization processes in the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal Rydberg gas, a system of growing interest for quantum sensing and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Long-term excitation energy transfer predicted by a modified convolutional neural networks in the FMO complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In machine learning (ML), the risk of recursive strategies overfitting historical data has driven the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. In this work, we propose an efficient CNNs scheme incorporating novel redundant time-functions to predict 100 picosecond (ps) excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, in which the original time $t$ is normalized by mapping it to the [0, 1] range, allowing different functions focus on distinct time intervals, thereby effectively capturing the multi-timescale characteristics of EET dynamics. This method simplifies optimization and enhances learning efficiency, and demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in predicting quantum dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Field-tunable spin disordered phase in the triangular-lattice delafossite TlYbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice compound TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around ~ 30 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.</description>

      <title>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proposed recently by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates (2022) was supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (2023). In the present paper it is demonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity arises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding experimental data in the "strange metal" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as reviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the "strange metal" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by L.Li et al. (2010) in the "strange metal" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a possible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$ cuprates in the "strange metal" phase of their phase diagram. We believe , these results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model of the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin: Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</description>

      <title>More on genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.</description>
