      <title>The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Andreev versus Tunneling Spectroscopy of Unconventional Flat Band Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: STM experiments in the tunneling and Andreev regimes on graphene-based moire superconductors (SC) show two distinct energy scales whose origin is mysterious. We express the conductance of a normal-SC interface in terms of Green's functions, which allows us to sharpen the issues in two ways. First, we show that the two distinct energy scales cannot be understood in terms of a pseudogap in tunneling and a superconducting gap in the Andreev spectra. Second, the large Fermi velocity vF mismatch between the STM tip and the at band SC renormalizes a transparent interface towards the tunneling regime, and the ballistic Andreev regime cannot be realized in moire SCs. We also discuss self energy corrections to vF that determines the conductance. Finally, we offer a resolution to these problems by modeling the Andreev experiment as a circular metallic disc embedded in an unconventional SC. We show that with strong vF mismatch the low bias conductance is dominated by Andreev bound states induced by the tip at the interface with the unconventional SC. The ABS give rise to the low energy scale seen in Andreev experiments, smaller than the SC gap in tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>Semiconducting character in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate Y$_{0.5}$Sr$_{2.5}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the discovery of superconductivity under pressure in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer La$_3$Ni$^{2.5+}_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$^{2.66+}_3$O$_{10}$, a new field of nickelate superconductors opened up. In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-\delta}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phases and electron-phonon coupling in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent reports of pressure-induced superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we present a comprehensive investigation into the structural, electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties of this compound across a pressure range of 0 to 29.5 GPa. DFT+U calculations reveal that the A-type antiferromagnetic ground state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ persists throughout the studied pressure range. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni-$d_{xy}$ and Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level in both the $Fmmm$ and $Amam$ phases of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Phonon dispersion calculations for the $Fmmm$ phase reveal no imaginary modes from 12 to 29.5 GPa, confirming its dynamical stability in this pressure range. The vibrational frequencies of O atoms are substantially higher than those of Ni and La atoms, primarily due to the lower mass of oxygen. At 29.5 GPa, the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ for the $Fmmm$ phase is calculated to be 0.13. This small value suggests that conventional electron-phonon coupling is insufficient to explain the reported superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, indicating a potentially unconventional mechanism. The study offers nuanced, actionable insights that can strategically inform and direct subsequent experimental investigations into the design and optimization of nickel-based superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Spin supercurrent in parity mixed superconductors with structural chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral materials exhibit a spin filtering effect, so-called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). A recent observation of spin accumulation at the ends of a chiral-structured superconductor has opened up a new pathway for studying the CISS effect in superconductors. In chiral-structured superconductors, the admixture of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet order parameters significantly influences the properties of superconductivity. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between the superconducting order parameter and supercurrent-induced spin current, namely, the superconducting CISS effect. In weakly party-mixed superconductors, the spin current, which is predominantly temperature-independent, is carried by spin-polarized Cooper pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum. In contrast, in strongly party-mixed superconductors the temperature-dependent spin current is also carried by electrons with opposite momentum and antiparallel spins forming a Cooper pair. Chiral-structured superconductors will offer a novel platform for exploring the CISS effect and may provide deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms related to the parity-mixed order parameter.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect with Andreev and Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrids are useful for realizing the Josephson diode effect, where nonreciprocity in the supercurrents occurs due to the interplay of the Josephson effect and applied magnetic fields. These junctions can host Andreev and Majorana states with the same ingredients, though their interplay with the Josephson diode effect is unclear. In this work, we consider short Josephson junctions based on superconductor-semiconductor systems under homogeneous Zeeman fields and investigate the Josephson diode effect in the presence of Andreev and Majorana states. Under generic conditions, the Zeeman field component parallel to the spin-orbit axis promotes an asymmetric low-energy energy spectrum as a function of the superconducting phase, which persists in the trivial and topological phases hosting Andreev and Majorana bound states, respectively. Interestingly, this asymmetry creates supercurrents that are not odd functions of the phase difference, leading to a nonreciprocal behaviour and the Josephson diode effect. We show that the Josephson diode effect is particularly promoted under the presence of both zero-energy Andreev and Majorana bound states, revealing that Josephson diodes can be realized in the trivial and topological phases of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. We then demonstrate that the Zeeman field evolution of the diode's efficiencies can map the topological phase transition and the formation of Majorana bound states via an oscillatory behavior that becomes more visible in long superconductors. While Josephson diodes generally exist in the trivial and topological phases of Josephson junctions, we discover that in the tunneling regime only a Josephson diode effect in the topological phase remains due to the finite contribution of Majorana bound states. Our findings clarify the Josephson diode effect and aid in realizing Majorana-only Josephson diodes.</description>

      <title>Kramers nodal lines in intercalated TaS$_2$ superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kramers degeneracy is one fundamental embodiment of the quantum mechanical nature of particles with half-integer spin under time reversal symmetry. Under the chiral and noncentrosymmetric achiral crystalline symmetries, Kramers degeneracy emerges respectively as topological quasiparticles of Weyl fermions and Kramers nodal lines, anchoring the Berry phase-related physics of electrons. However, an experimental demonstration for ideal Kramers nodal lines (KNLs) well isolated at the Fermi level is lacking. Here, we establish a class of noncentrosymmetric achiral intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors with large Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, represented by In$_x$TaS$_2$, to host an ideal KNL phase. We provide evidence from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with spin resolution, angle-dependent quantum oscillation (QO) measurements, and ab-initio calculations. Our work not only provides a realistic platform for realizing and tuning KNLs in layered materials, but also paves the way for exploring the interplay between KNLs and superconductivity, as well as applications pertaining to spintronics, valleytronics, and nonlinear transport.</description>

      <title>Two key factors to superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: enhanced quasi-particle weight and strong local spin fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we systematically studies film bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (2222-La327), hybrid monolayer-bilayer La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ (1212-La5311), and La$_2$NiO$_4$ under doping or high-pressure conditions. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, suggesting that they are key to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into a phase diagram with local spin moment as a parameter, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism (SDW/AFM), superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished surprisingly. At last, we predict a promising candidate of superconducting RP nickelate, which is constructed in a ``bilayer-trilayer'' stacking sequence.</description>

      <title>Transitional supersolidity in ion doped helium droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $^4$He nanodroplets doped with an alkali ion feature a snowball of crystallized layers surrounded by superfluid helium. For large droplets, we predict that a transitional supersolid layer can form, bridging between the solid core and the liquid bulk, where the $^4$He density displays modulations of icosahedral group symmetry. To identify the different phases, we combine density functional theory with the semiclassical Gaussian time-dependent Hartree method for localized many-body systems. This hybrid approach can handle large particle numbers and provides insight into the physical origin of the supersolid layer. For small droplets, we verify that the predictions of our approach are in excellent agreement with Path-Integral Monte Carlo calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful way to guarantee the absence of a sign problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations is imposing a particular type of anti-unitary symmetries. It is shown that these same symmetries give rise to constraints on correlation functions, which can be used to identify local operators whose correlations upper bound those of a large class of physically relevant operators, including for example superconducting order parameters. Our results also help understand why it is difficult to realize generic finite-momentum orders in sign problem-free models.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Coulomb repulsion and oxygen level on charge distribution and superconductivity in the Emery model for cuprates superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Emery model (aka the three-band Hubbard model) offers a simplified description of the copper-oxide planes that form the building blocks of high-temperature superconductors. By contrast with the even simpler one-band Hubbard model, it differentiates between copper and oxygen orbitals and thus between oxygen occupation ($n_p$) and copper occupation ($n_d$). Here we demonstrate, using cluster dynamical mean field theory, how the two occupations are related to the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ on the copper orbital and to the energy difference $\epsilon_p$ between oxygen and copper orbitals. Since the occupations ($n_p$ and $n_d$) have been estimated from NMR for a few materials (LCO, YBCO and NCCO), this allows us to estimate the value of $U-\epsilon_p$ for these materials, within this model. We compute the density of states for these and the effect of $(U,\epsilon_p)$ on the $n_d$-$n_p$ curve, superconductivity, and antiferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Mitigating transients in flux-control signals in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux-tunable qubits and couplers are common components in superconducting quantum processors. However, dynamically controlling these elements via current pulses poses challenges due to distortions and transients in the propagating signals. In particular, long-time transients can persist, adversely affecting subsequent qubit control operations. We model the flux control line as a first-order RC circuit and introduce a class of pulses designed to mitigate long-time transients. We theoretically demonstrate the robustness of these pulses against parameter mischaracterization and provide experimental evidence of their effectiveness in mitigating transients when applied to a flux-tunable qubit coupler. The proposed pulse design offers a practical solution for mitigating long-time transients, enabling efficient and reliable experiment tune-ups without requiring detailed flux line characterization.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals arise in a variety of platforms for strongly correlated electrons, ranging from the cuprates, heavy fermions to flat band systems. Motivated by recent experiments in kagome metals, we study a Hubbard model on a kagome lattice whose noninteracting limit contains flat bands. A Kondo lattice description is constructed, in which the correlation effects are captured by symmetry preserving and exponentially localized molecular orbitals. These compact molecular orbitals represent the local degrees of freedom that emerge from topological flat bands. We identify a quantum critical point at which quasiparticles are lost and strange metallicity emerges. Our theoretical work opens up a new route for realizing beyond-Landau quantum criticality, as well as the associated strange metallicity and emergent quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

      <title>Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit-flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors and Andreev spin qubits results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit-flip code. The electrodynamics of the many-body spin states also respect these stabilizers, and we show how reflectometry off a single coupled resonator can thereby accomplish their projective measurement. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of single- and two-module logical quantum gates. The concept, which we dub the Ising molecule qubit (or Isene), is experimentally feasible and provides a path for compact noise-biased qubits.</description>

      <title>Inductively coupled Josephson junctions: a platform for rich neuromorphic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are by nature neuromorphic hardware devices capable of mimicking excitability and spiking dynamics. When coupled together or combined with other superconducting elements, they can emulate additional behaviors found in biological neurons. From a technological point of view, JJ-based neuromorphic systems are particularly appealing since they present THz-speed processing and they operate with near-zero power dissipation. In this work we study a system of inductively coupled JJs and focus on the nonlinear dynamical aspects of its neurocomputational properties. In particular, we report on spiking behavior related to a saddle-node off invariant cycle bifurcation and excitability type 2, synchronization, first spike latency effects, and multistability. Special emphasis is placed on the bursting dynamics the system is capable of reproducing, and a new underlying mechanism is proposed beyond the approach followed in prior works.</description>
