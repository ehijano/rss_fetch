      <title>A novel scalable high performance diffusion solver for multiscale cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based cellular models simulate tissue evolution by capturing the behavior of individual cells, their interactions with neighboring cells, and their responses to the surrounding microenvironment. An important challenge in the field is scaling cellular resolution models to real-scale tumor simulations, which is critical for the development of digital twin models of diseases and requires the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) since every time step involves trillions of operations. We hereby present a scalable HPC solution for the molecular diffusion modeling using an efficient implementation of state-of-the-art Finite Volume Method (FVM) frameworks. The paper systematically evaluates a novel scalable Biological Finite Volume Method (BioFVM) library and presents an extensive performance analysis of the available solutions. Results shows that our HPC proposal reach almost 200x speedup and up to 36% reduction in memory usage over the current state-of-the-art solutions, paving the way to efficiently compute the next generation of biological problems.</description>

      <title>Towards Advancing Research with Workflows: A perspective from the Workflows Community Summit -- Amsterdam, 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific workflows have become essential for orchestrating complex computational processes across distributed resources, managing large datasets, and ensuring reproducibility in modern research. The Workflows Community Summit 2025, held in Amsterdam on June 6th, 2025, convened international experts to examine emerging challenges and opportunities in this domain. Participants identified key barriers to workflow adoption, including tensions between system generality and domain-specific utility, concerns over long-term sustainability of workflow systems and services, insufficient recognition for those who develop and maintain reproducible workflows, and gaps in standardization, funding, training, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, the summit proposed action lines spanning technology, policy, and community dimensions: shifting evaluation metrics from raw computational performance toward measuring genuine scientific impact; formalizing workflow patterns and community-driven benchmarks to improve transparency, reproducibility, and usability; cultivating a cohesive international workflows community that engages funding bodies and research stakeholders; and investing in human capital through dedicated workflow engineering roles, career pathways, and integration of workflow concepts into educational curricula and long-term training initiatives. This document presents the summit's findings, beginning with an overview of the current computing ecosystem and the rationale for workflow-centric approaches, followed by a discussion of identified challenges and recommended action lines for advancing scientific discovery through workflows.</description>

      <title>ORACL: Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications are moving away from monolithic designs to microservice and serverless architectures, where fleets of lightweight and independently deployable components run on public clouds. Autoscaling serves as the primary control mechanism for balancing resource utilization and quality of service, yet existing policies are either opaque learned models that require substantial per-deployment training or brittle hand-tuned rules that fail to generalize. We investigate whether large language models can act as universal few-shot resource allocators that adapt across rapidly evolving microservice deployments.
  We propose ORACL, Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices, a framework that leverages prior knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning to diagnose performance regressions and recommend resource allocations. ORACL transforms runtime telemetry, including pods, replicas, CPU and memory usage, latency, service-level objectives, and fault signals, into semantic natural-language state descriptions and invokes an LLM to produce an interpretable intermediate reasoning trace. This reasoning identifies likely root causes, prunes the action space, and issues safe allocation decisions under policy constraints. Experiments on representative open-source microservice workloads show that ORACL improves root-cause identification accuracy by 15 percent, accelerates training by up to 24x, and improves quality of service by 6 percent in short-term scenarios, without deployment-specific retraining.</description>

      <title>Proteus: Append-Only Ledgers for (Mostly) Trusted Execution Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed ledgers are increasingly relied upon by industry to provide trustworthy accountability, strong integrity protection, and high availability for critical data without centralizing trust. Recently, distributed append-only logs are opting for a layered approach, combining crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus with hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for greater resiliency. Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs. Proteus carefully embeds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol inside of a CFT protocol with no additional messages. This is made possible through careful refactoring of both the CFT and BFT protocols such that their structure aligns. Proteus achieves performance in line with regular TEE-enabled consensus protocols, while guaranteeing integrity in the face of TEE platform compromises.</description>

      <title>Reaching Univalency with Subquadratic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dolev-Reischuk lower bound establishes that any deterministic Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol for $n$ processors tolerating $f$ faults requires $\Omega(f^2+n)$ messages. But what exactly does this quadratic cost pay for? Even the minimal requirement that every correct processor \emph{receive at least one message} already necessitates $\Omega(f^2 + n)$ messages. This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward?
  We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $\epsilon$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $\epsilon$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \log n)$ communication complexity when $f &lt; n(1/3 - \epsilon)$. Crucially, any $\epsilon$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $\epsilon$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $\epsilon$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency. We also define Extractable BA for authenticated settings, capturing when processors collectively hold enough signed messages to determine the agreed value, and show it can be solved with communication complexity $O(f \log f)$.</description>

      <title>TimelyFreeze: Adaptive Parameter Freezing Mechanism for Pipeline Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pipeline parallelism enables training models that exceed single-device memory, but practical throughput remains limited by pipeline bubbles. Although parameter freezing can improve training throughput by adaptively skipping backward computation, existing methods often over-freeze parameters, resulting in unnecessary accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose TimelyFreeze, which models the pipeline schedule as a directed acyclic graph and solves a linear program to compute optimal freeze ratios that minimize batch execution time under accuracy constraints. Experiments show that TimelyFreeze achieves up to 40% training throughput improvement on LLaMA-8B with comparable accuracy. Overall, it enables faster large-scale model training without compromising convergence and generalizes across diverse pipeline-parallel settings.</description>

      <title>Location-Aware Dispersion on Anonymous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-studied DISPERSION problem is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed robotics, where a set of mobile robots must relocate so that each occupies a distinct node of a network. DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\sf{col}(v) \in C = \{c_1, \dots, c_t\}, t\leq n$. A set $R = \{r_1, \dots, r_k\}$ of $k \leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\mathsf{col}(r_i) \in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$.
  Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Kubernetes Performance for GenAI Inference: From Automatic Speech Recognition to LLM Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI), particularly inference, rapidly emerges as a dominant workload category, the Kubernetes ecosystem is proactively evolving to natively support its unique demands. This industry paper demonstrates how emerging Kubernetes-native projects can be combined to deliver the benefits of container orchestration, such as scalability and resource efficiency, to complex AI workflows. We implement and evaluate an illustrative, multi-stage use case consisting of automatic speech recognition and summarization. First, we address batch inference by using Kueue to manage jobs that transcribe audio files with Whisper models and Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) to increase parallel job execution. Second, we address a discrete online inference scenario by feeding the transcripts to a Large Language Model for summarization hosted using llm-d, a novel solution utilizing the recent developments around the Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE) for optimized routing of inference requests. Our findings illustrate that these complementary components (Kueue, DAS, and GAIE) form a cohesive, high-performance platform, proving Kubernetes' capability to serve as a unified foundation for demanding GenAI workloads: Kueue reduced total makespan by up to 15%; DAS shortened mean job completion time by 36%; and GAIE improved Time to First Token by 82\%.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Error Mitigation: Global and Local ZNE encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Errors are the primary bottleneck preventing practical quantum computing. This challenge is exacerbated in the distributed quantum computing regime, where quantum networks introduce additional communication-induced noise. While error mitigation techniques such as Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) have proven effective for standalone quantum processors, their behavior in distributed architectures is not yet well understood. We investigate ZNE in this setting by comparing Global optimization (ZNE is applied prior to circuit partitioning), against Local optimization (ZNE is applied independently to each sub-circuit). Partitioning is performed on a monolithic circuit, which is then transformed into a distributed implementation by inserting noisy teleportation-based communication primitives between sub-circuits. We evaluate both approaches across varying numbers of quantum processing units (QPUs) and under heterogeneous local and network noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that Global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving error reductions of up to $48\%$ across six QPUs. Moreover, we observe counterintuitive noise behavior, where increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead. These findings highlight fundamental trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation and raise new questions regarding the interplay between circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise.</description>

      <title>From Sequential to Parallel: Reformulating Dynamic Programming as GPU Kernels for Large-Scale Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major bottleneck in scenario-based Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming (SP) is the cost of solving an exact second-stage problem for every scenario, especially when each scenario contains an NP-hard combinatorial structure. This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization.</description>

      <title>Emergence-as-Code for Self-Governing Reliable Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SLO-as-code has made per-service} reliability declarative, but user experience is defined by journeys whose reliability is an emergent property of microservice topology, routing, redundancy, timeouts/fallbacks, shared failure domains, and tail amplification. As a result, journey objectives (e.g., "checkout p99 &lt; 400 ms") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs.</description>

      <title>Sovereign-by-Design A Reference Architecture for AI and Blockchain Enabled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital sovereignty has emerged as a central concern for modern software-intensive systems, driven by the dominance of non-sovereign cloud infrastructures, the rapid adoption of Generative AI, and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems. The proposed reference architecture provides a principled starting point for future research and practice at the intersection of software architecture, Generative AI, and digital sovereignty.</description>

      <title>Smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid for problems with heterogeneous and anisotropic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a material-aware strength-of-connection measure for smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid methods, aimed at improving robustness for scalar partial differential equations with heterogeneous and anisotropic material properties. Classical strength-of-connection measures typically rely only on matrix entries or geometric distances, which often fail to capture weak couplings across material interfaces or align with anisotropy directions, ultimately leading to poor convergence. The proposed approach directly incorporates material tensor information into the coarsening process, enabling a reliable detection of weak connections and ensuring that coarse levels preserve the true structure of the underlying problem. As a result, smooth error components are represented properly and sharp coefficient jumps or directional anisotropies are handled consistently. A wide range of academic tests and real-world applications, including thermally activated batteries and solar cells, demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robustness across material contrasts, anisotropies, and mesh variations. Scalability and parallel performance of the algebraic multigrid method highlight the suitability for large-scale, high-performance computing environments.</description>

      <title>FedRandom: Sampling Consistent and Accurate Contribution Values in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Message Complexity of Distributed Wake-Up with Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the distributed wake-up problem with advice, where nodes are equipped with initial knowledge about the network at large. After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $\alpha$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max\{\lfloor (\alpha-1)/2 \rfloor},0\}}}\cdot\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $\Omega( \frac{n^2}{2^\alpha} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $\Omega( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.</description>

      <title>Opt4GPTQ: Co-Optimizing Memory and Computation for 4-bit GPTQ Quantized LLM Inference on Heterogeneous Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) on heterogeneous computing platforms poses significant challenges to achieving high inference efficiency. To address these efficiency bottlenecks across diverse platforms, this paper proposes Opt4GPTQ, a practical optimization method designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering Optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches frequently accessed data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading Optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly Optimization (ILA-Opt), which directly leverages hardwarenative vector half-precision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves performance across various models while maintaining original model accuracy, achieving throughput gains of up to 84.42%. This work highlights the critical role of platformlevel engineering in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging architectures and provides valuable methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.</description>

      <title>Device Association and Resource Allocation for Hierarchical Split Federated Learning in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6G facilitates deployment of Federated Learning (FL) in the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN), yet FL confronts challenges such as resource constrained and unbalanced data distribution. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Split Federated Learning (HSFL) framework and derives its upper bound of loss function. To minimize the weighted sum of training loss and latency, we formulate a joint optimization problem that integrates device association, model split layer selection, and resource allocation. We decompose the original problem into several subproblems, where an iterative optimization algorithm for device association and resource allocation based on brute-force split point search is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively balance training efficiency and model accuracy for FL in SAGIN.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Analysis of Decentralized Gossip Averaging under Varying Threat Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving differential privacy (DP) guarantees in fully decentralized machine learning is challenging due to the absence of a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. We present a framework for DP analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging algorithms with additive node-level noise, from arbitrary views of nodes in a graph. We present an analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately characterizes privacy leakage between nodes. Our main contribution is showing that the DP guarantees are those of a Gaussian mechanism, where the growth of the squared sensitivity is asymptotically $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of training rounds, similarly as in the case of central aggregation. As an application of the sensitivity analysis, we show that the excess risk of decentralized private learning for strongly convex losses is asymptotically similar as in centralized private learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose VibeCodeHPC, an automatic tuning system for HPC programs based on multi-agent LLMs for code generation. VibeCodeHPC tunes programs through multi-agent role allocation and iterative prompt refinement. We describe the system configuration with four roles: Project Manager (PM), System Engineer (SE), Programmer (PG), and Continuous Delivery (CD). We introduce dynamic agent deployment and activity monitoring functions to facilitate effective multi-agent collaboration. In our case study, we convert and optimize CPU-based matrix-matrix multiplication code written in C to GPU code using CUDA. The multi-agent configuration of VibeCodeHPC achieved higher-quality code generation per unit time compared to a solo-agent configuration. Additionally, the dynamic agent deployment and activity monitoring capabilities facilitated more effective identification of requirement violations and other issues.</description>

      <title>Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</description>

      <title>Fancy Some Chips for Your TeaStore? Modeling the Control of an Adaptable Discrete System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When designing new web applications, developers must cope with different kinds of constraints relative to the resources they rely on: software, hardware, network, online micro-services, or any combination of the mentioned entities. Together, these entities form a complex system of communicating interdependent processes, physical or logical. It is very desirable that such system ensures its robustness to provide a good quality of service. In this paper we introduce Chips, a language that aims at facilitating the design of models made of various entwined components. It allows the description of applications in the form of functional blocks. Chips mixes notions from control theory and general purpose programming languages to generate robust component-based models. This paper presents how to use Chips to systematically design, model and analyse a complex system project, using a variation of the Adaptable TeaStore application as running example.</description>

      <title>Horizon-LM: A RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.</description>
