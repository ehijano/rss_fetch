      <title>Multimodal Language Models with Modality-Specific Experts for Financial Forecasting from Interleaved Sequences of Text and Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text and time series data offer complementary views of financial markets: news articles provide narrative context about company events, while stock prices reflect how markets react to those events. However, despite their complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal and multimodal baselines. We develop an interpretability method that reveals insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these improvements translate to meaningful economic gains in investment simulations.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Dependence in Financial Markets: Empirical Evidence and Generative Modeling Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive empirical investigation of the presence of long-range dependence (LRD) in the dynamics of major U.S. stock market indexes--S\&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq--at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. We employ three distinct methods: the classical rescaled range (R/S) analysis, the more robust detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and a sophisticated ARFIMA--FIGARCH model with Student's $t$-distributed innovations. Our results confirm the presence of LRD, primarily driven by long memory in volatility rather than in the mean returns. Building on these findings, we explore the capability of a modern deep learning approach, Quant generative adversarial networks (GANs), to learn and replicate the LRD observed in the empirical data. While Quant GANs effectively capture heavy-tailed distributions and some aspects of volatility clustering, they suffer from significant limitations in reproducing the LRD, particularly at higher frequencies. This work highlights the challenges and opportunities in using data-driven models for generating realistic financial time series that preserve complex temporal dependencies.</description>

      <title>Roughness Analysis of Realized Volatility and VIX through Randomized Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel distribution-based estimator for the Hurst parameter of log-volatility, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to assess the scaling behavior of entire distributions rather than individual moments. To address the temporal dependence of financial volatility, we propose a random permutation procedure that effectively removes serial correlation while preserving marginal distributions, enabling the rigorous application of the KS framework to dependent data. We establish the asymptotic variance of the estimator, useful for inference and confidence interval construction. From a computational standpoint, we show that derivative-free optimization methods, particularly Brent's method and the Nelder-Mead simplex, achieve substantial efficiency gains relative to grid search while maintaining estimation accuracy. Empirical analysis of the CBOE VIX index and the 5-minute realized volatility of the S&amp;P 500 reveals a statistically significant hierarchy of roughness, with implied volatility smoother than realized volatility. Both measures, however, exhibit Hurst exponents well below one-half, reinforcing the rough volatility paradigm and highlighting the open challenge of disentangling local roughness from long-memory effects in fractional modeling.</description>

      <title>Error Propagation in Dynamic Programming: From Stochastic Control to Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates theoretical and methodological foundations for stochastic optimal control (SOC) in discrete time. We start formulating the control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing of American options.</description>
