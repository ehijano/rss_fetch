      <title>Uncertainty-aware t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding for Single-cell RNA-seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear data visualization using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) enables the representation of complex single-cell transcriptomic landscapes in two or three dimensions to depict biological populations accurately. However, t-SNE often fails to account for uncertainties in the original dataset, leading to misleading visualizations where cell subsets with noise appear indistinguishable. To address these challenges, we introduce uncertainty-aware t-SNE (Ut-SNE), a noise-defending visualization tool tailored for uncertain single-cell RNA-seq data. By creating a probabilistic representation for each sample, Our Ut-SNE accurately incorporates noise about transcriptomic variability into the visual interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data, revealing significant uncertainties in transcriptomic variability. Through various examples, we showcase the practical value of Ut-SNE and underscore the significance of incorporating uncertainty awareness into data visualization practices. This versatile uncertainty-aware visualization tool can be easily adapted to other scientific domains beyond single-cell RNA sequencing, making them valuable resources for high-dimensional data analysis.</description>

      <title>Supervised machine learning for microbiomics: bridging the gap between current and best practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is set to accelerate innovations in clinical microbiomics, such as in disease diagnostics and prognostics. This will require high-quality, reproducible, interpretable workflows whose predictive capabilities meet or exceed the high thresholds set for clinical tools by regulatory agencies. Here, we capture a snapshot of current practices in the application of supervised ML to microbiomics data, through an in-depth analysis of 100 peer-reviewed journal articles published in 2021-2022. We apply a data-driven approach to steer discussion of the merits of varied approaches to experimental design, including key considerations such as how to mitigate the effects of small dataset size while avoiding data leakage. We further provide guidance on how to avoid common experimental design pitfalls that can hurt model performance, trustworthiness, and reproducibility. Discussion is accompanied by an interactive online tutorial that demonstrates foundational principles of ML experimental design, tailored to the microbiomics community. Formalizing community best practices for supervised ML in microbiomics is an important step towards improving the success and efficiency of clinical research, to the benefit of patients and other stakeholders.</description>
