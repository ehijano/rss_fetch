      <title>Forward operator monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies collections of Hilbert space operators which possess a strict monoid structure under composition. These collections can be thought of as discrete unital semigroups for which no subset of the collection is closed under composition (apart from the trivial subset containing only the identity). We call these collections $\textit{forward operator monoids}$. Although not traditionally painted in this light, monoids of this flavor appear in many areas of analysis; as we shall see, they are intimately linked to several well-known problems. The main aim of this work is to study three classes of vectors associated to a given operator monoid: cyclic vectors, generalized inner vectors, and vectors which are both cyclic and inner (we refer to this last class as aleph vectors). We show, when they exist, aleph vectors are unique up to a multiplicative constant. We also show, under the lens of a least-squares problem, how an aleph vector can be used to characterize all cyclic and inner vectors. As an application of this theory, we consider monoids related to the Periodic Dilation Completeness Problem and the Riemann Hypothesis. After recovering some known results, we conclude by giving a further reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis based on works of B\'{a}ez-Duarte and Noor.</description>

      <title>Extending Mercer's expansion to indefinite and asymmetric kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mercer's expansion and Mercer's theorem are cornerstone results in kernel theory. While the classical Mercer's theorem only considers continuous symmetric positive definite kernels, analogous expansions are effective in practice for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. In this paper we extend Mercer's expansion to continuous kernels, providing a rigorous theoretical underpinning for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. We begin by demonstrating that Mercer's expansion may not be pointwise convergent for continuous indefinite kernels, before proving that the expansion of continuous kernels with bounded variation uniformly in each variable separably converges pointwise almost everywhere, almost uniformly, and unconditionally almost everywhere. We also describe an algorithm for computing Mercer's expansion for general kernels and give new decay bounds on its terms.</description>

      <title>Twisted Roe algebras and $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of twisted Roe algebras and a twisted coarse Baum-Connes conjecture. We study the basic properties of twisted Roe algebras, including a coarse analogue of the imprimitivity theorem for metric spaces with a structure of coarse fibrations. We show that the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a metric space with a coarse fibration structure when the base space and the fiber satisfy the twisted coarse Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients. As an application, the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a finitely generated group which is an extension of coarsely embeddable groups.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Peter--Weyl Truncations of Compact Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coamenable compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ as a compact quantum metric space if its function algebra $\mathrm{C}(\mathbb{G})$ is equipped with a Lip-norm. By using a projection $P$ onto direct summands of the Peter--Weyl decomposition, the $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra $\mathrm{C}(\mathbb{G})$ can be compressed to an operator system $P\mathrm{C}(\mathbb{G})P$, and there are induced left and right coactions on this operator system. Assuming that the Lip-norm on $\mathrm{C}(\mathbb{G})$ is bi-invariant in the sense of Li, there is an induced bi-invariant Lip-norm on the operator system $P\mathrm{C}(\mathbb{G})P$ turning it into a compact quantum metric space. Given an appropriate net of such projections which converges strongly to the identity map on the Hilbert space $\mathrm{L}^2(\mathbb{G})$, we obtain a net of compact quantum metric spaces. We prove convergence of such nets in terms of Kerr's complete Gromov--Hausdorff distance. An important tool is the choice of an appropriate state whose induced slice map gives an approximate inverse of the compression map $\mathrm{C}(\mathbb{G}) \ni a \mapsto PaP$ in Lip-norm.</description>

Abstract: If $T$ is a compactly supported distribution on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, then the Fourier transform of $T$ is $p$-th power integrable if and only if the Weyl transform of $T$ is $p$-th power traceable, and the Fourier transform of $T$ vanishes at infinity if and only if the Weyl transform of $T$ is a compact operator.</description>

      <title>Functional Integral Construction of Topological Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce regular stratified piecewise linear manifolds to describe lattices and investigate the lattice model approach to topological quantum field theory in all dimensions. We introduce the unitary $n+1$ alterfold TQFT and construct it from a linear functional on an $n$-dimensional lattice model on an $n$-sphere satisfying three conditions: reflection positivity, homeomorphic invariance and complete finiteness. A unitary spherical $n$-category is mathematically defined and emerges as the local quantum symmetry of the lattice model. The alterfold construction unifies various constructions of $n+1$ TQFT from $n$-dimensional lattice models and $n$-categories. In particular, we construct a non-invertible unitary 3+1 alterfold TQFT from a linear functional and derive its local quantum symmetry as a unitary spherical 3-category of Ising type with explicit 20j-symbols, so that the scalar invariant of 2-knots in piecewise linear 4-manifolds could be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Weighted shifts on directed forests and hyponormality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a paper from 2012 Jab{\l}o\'nski, Jung and Stochel introduced the weighted shifts on directed trees, a generalisation of well known weighted shift operators on $\ell^2$. In the last decade this class has proven itself handy for finding counterexamples in operator theory. Properties of underlying graph structure had essential influence on the operator. It appears that a slight generalisation of the class, namely weighted shifts on directed forests, shows even deeper relations between graph theory and functional analysis. Several operations on directed forests have their natural operator-theoretic counterparts. This paper is meant to present advantages of the directed forest approach. As an application of the interrelation between graphs and operators we provide full characterisation of directed forests on which every hyponormal bounded weighted shift is power hyponormal.</description>

      <title>On the strongly subdifferentiable points in Lipschitz-free spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present some sufficient conditions on a metric space $M$ for which every molecule is a strongly subdifferentiable (SSD, for short) point in the Lipschitz-free space $\mathcal{F}(M)$ over $M$. Our main result reads as follows: if $(M,d)$ is a metric space and $\gamma &gt; 0$, then there exists a (not necessarily equivalent) metric $d_{\gamma}$ in $M$ such that every finitely supported element in $\mathcal{F}(M, d_{\gamma})$ is an SSD point. As an application of the main result, it follows that if $M$ is uniformly discrete and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is given, there exists a metric space $N$ and a $(1+\varepsilon)$-bi-Lipschitz map $\phi: M \rightarrow N$ such that the set of all SSD points in $\mathcal{F}(N)$ is dense.</description>

      <title>The sharp constants in the real anisotropic Littlewood's $\boldsymbol{4 / 3}$ inequality and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real anisotropic Littlewood's $4 / 3$ inequality is an extension of a famous result obtained in 1930 by J. E. Littlewood. It asserts that, for $a , b \in ( 0 , \infty )$, the following conditions are equivalent:
  $\bullet$ There is an optimal constant $\mathsf{L}_{ a , b }^{ \mathbb{R} } \in [ 1 , \infty )$ such that
  \[ \Biggl ( \, \sum_{ k = 1 }^{ \infty } \biggl ( \, \sum_{ j = 1 }^{ \infty } \bigl \lvert A \bigl ( \boldsymbol{e}^{ (k) } , \boldsymbol{e}^{ (j) } \bigr ) \bigr \rvert^a \biggr )^{ \frac{b}{a} } \Biggr )^{ \frac{1}{b} } \leq \mathsf{L}_{ a , b }^{ \mathbb{R} } \cdot \lVert A \rVert \]
  for every continuous bilinear form $A \colon c_0 \times c_0 \to \mathbb{R}$.
  $\bullet$ The values $a , b$ satisfy $a , b \geq 1$ and $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \leq \frac{3}{2}$.
  Several authors have obtained the values of $\mathsf{L}_{ a , b }^{ \mathbb{R} }$ for diverse pairs $( a , b )$. In this paper we provide the complete list of such optimal values, as well as new estimates for $\mathsf{L}_{ a , b }^{ \mathbb{C} }$ (the analog for continuous $\mathbb{C}$-bilinear forms), which are exact in several cases. As an application we prove, in terms of the values $\mathsf{L}_{ 1 , r }^{ \mathbb{C} }$, a variant of Khinchin's inequality for Steinhaus variables, and we determine all the optimal $( q , s )$-cotype constants of the spaces $\ell_1 ( \mathbb{K} )$ (with $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) in terms of the values $\mathsf{L}_{ 1 , q }^{ \mathbb{R} }$.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Estimates for Maxwell's Equations in the Exterior of a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to establish general principles for high frequency dispersive estimates for Maxwell's equation in the exterior of a perfectly conducting ball. We construct entirely new generalized eigenfunctions for the corresponding Maxwell propagator. We show that the propagator corresponding to the electric field has a global rate of decay in $L^1-L^{\infty}$ operator norm in terms of time $t$ and powers of $h$. In particular we show that some, but not all, polarizations of electromagnetic waves scatter at the same rate as the usual wave operator. The Dirichlet Laplacian wave operator $L^1-L^{\infty}$ norm estimate should not be expected to hold in general for Maxwell's equations in the exterior of a ball because of the Helmholtz decomposition theorem.</description>
