      <title>Winding quotients for virtual period maps of rank 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate a rank 1 model of virtual period maps and their associated winding quotient, where the winding quotient is a new phenomenon appeared in a recent study of virtual period maps and it requires a reformulation of the classical inversion problem for the period maps. We answer to the new inversion problem by introducing the q-multiplicatively periodic function, whose pull-back to the winding covering space is the Weierstrass p-function up to a correction by Eisenstein series E2, and which was used in recent mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>On rigid $q$-plurisubharmonic functions and $q$-pseudoconvex tube domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of Lelong and Bochner, we show that an upper semi-continuous function defined on a open tube set $\Omega=\omega + i\mathbb{R}^n$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$, where $\omega$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and which is invariant in its imaginary part, is $q$-plurisubharmonic on $\Omega$ (in the sense of Hunt and Murray) if and only if it is real $q$-convex on $\omega$, i.e., it admits the local maximum property with respect to affine linear functions on real $(q+1)$-dimensional affine subspaces. From this, we conclude that, for $a&gt;0$, the set $\omega+i(-a,a)^n$ is $q$-pseudoconvex in $\mathbb{C}^n$ if and only if $\omega$ is a real $q$-convex set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e., $\omega$ admits a real $q$-convex exhaustion function on $\omega$. We apply these results to complements of graphs of affine linear maps and to Reinhardt domains.</description>

      <title>Indeterminate Jacobi operators II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Jacobi operator (T,D(T)) associated with an indeterminate Hamburger moment problem, and present countable subsets S of the domain D(T) such that span(S) is dense in \ell^2. As an example we have S={(p_n(u))+B(u)(p_n(0)):D(u)=0}, where (p_n) denotes the orthonormal polynomials of the moment problem and B,D are two of the Nevanlinna functions. It is also proved that sets like S are optimal in the sense that if one vector is removed, then the span is no longer dense.</description>

      <title>Unbranched Riemann domains over Stein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1800</link>
      <description>arXiv:0911.1800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show that if $\Pi: X\rightarrow \Omega$ is an unbranched Riemann domain with $\Omega$ Stein and $\Pi$ a locally 1-complete morphism, then $X$ is Stein. This gives in particular a positive answer to the local Steiness problem, namely if $X$ is a Stein space and, if $\Omega$ is a locally Stein open set in $X$, then $\Omega$ is Stein.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimates for mappings admitting general Poisson representations in the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $1&lt;p\leq\infty$ and $\varphi\in L^{p}(\mathbb{B}^{n},\mathbb{R}^{n}).$ In this note, we use H\"{o}lder inequality and some basic properties of hypergeometric functions to establish the sharp constant $C_{p}$ and function $C_{p}(x)$ in the following inequalities $$|u(x)|\leq \frac{C_{p}}{(1-|x|^{2})^{(n-1)/p}}\cdot||\varphi||_{L^{p}}$$
  and
  $$|u(x)|\leq \frac{C_{p}(x)}{(1-|x|^{2})^{(n-1)/p}}\cdot||\varphi||_{L^{p}},$$
  where $u$ are those mapping from the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^{n}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ admitting general Poisson representations. The obtained results generalize and extend some known results from harmonic mappings (\cite[Proposition 6.16]{ABR92} and \cite[Theorems 1.1 and 1.2]{DM12}) and hyperbolic harmonic mappings (\cite[Theorems 1.1 and 1.2]{CJLK20}).</description>

      <title>A Formula for the Pluricomplex Green Function of the Bidisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a formula for the pluricomplex Green function of the bidisk with two poles of equal weights. In 2017, Kosi\'nski, Thomas, and Zwonek proved the Lempert function and the pluricomplex Green function are equal on the bidisk, and their description of Lempert function was pivotal in computing the formula for the pluricomplex Green function. We divide the bidisk into two open regions, where the formula is found explicitly on the first region, and the other region is the union of a family of hypersurfaces. On each hypersurface, the formula is explicit up to a unimodular constant that is the root of a sixth degree polynomial. This derived formula for the bidisk leads to an explicit formula for the Carath\'eodory metric on the symmetrized bidisk up to a fourth degree polynomial. In 2004, Agler and Young found a formula for Carath\'eodory metric for the symmetrized bidisk that involves a supremum over the unimodular constants. The formula derived in this paper matches Agler and Young's formula, but the unimodular constant is determined by a 4th degree polynomial instead of the before mentioned supremum.</description>

      <title>Bicomplex Hardy Classes of Solutions to Beltrami Equations and the Schwarz Boundary Value Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions on the complex unit disk which solve bicomplex versions of the Beltrami and related equations. Using representations in terms of their complex-valued counterparts, we show these bicomplex-valued functions recover the boundary behavior associated with the classic holomorphic Hardy spaces. This work generalizes known results for complex-valued functions and continues recent work in the setting of bicomplex analogues of Hardy spaces of both holomorphic and generalized analytic functions. Also, we show Schwarz and Dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the bicomplex Beltrami equation are solvable and provide solution formulas.</description>

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of the Bigolin complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a compact complex manifold, we study the cohomology and the Hodge theory for the elliptic complex of differential forms defined by Bigolin in 1969 and recently referred to as the Schweitzer complex. Recall that the double complex of a compact complex manifold decomposes into a direct sum of so-called squares and zigzags, and the zigzags are the only components contributing to cohomology. The main result of this paper states that in complex dimension 3, the multiplicities of zigzags in this decomposition are completely characterised by Betti, Hodge, Aeppli numbers plus Bigolin numbers, namely the dimensions of the Bigolin cohomology. The result is sharp, meaning that if we remove Hodge or Bigolin numbers from the previous statement then it becomes false. In addition, we compute the Bigolin cohomology on the small deformations of the complex structure of the Iwasawa manifold, and then apply the main theorem to fully describe the double complexes of all the small deformations. We also prove a Hodge decomposition for Bigolin harmonic forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds of any dimension. Finally, we partially extend the definition of this complex on almost complex manifolds, providing a cohomological invariant on $1$-forms which is finite when the manifold is compact.</description>

      <title>Bounded symbols of Toeplitz operators on Paley-Wiener spaces and a weak factorization theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical result by R. Rochberg says that every bounded Toeplitz operator $T$ on the Hilbert Paley-Wiener space $\mathrm{PW}_a^2$ admits a bounded symbol $\varphi$. We generalize this result to Toeplitz operators on the Banach Paley-Wiener spaces $\mathrm{PW}_a^p$, $1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$. The Toeplitz commutator theorem describes the integral identity that must hold for a bounded operator $T$ on $\mathrm{PW}_a^p$ to be a Toeplitz operator on $\mathrm{PW}_a^p$. We prove this theorem in the continuous case, thus extending the result previously obtained by D. Sarason in the discrete case. Upon combining the results, we establish the weak factorization theorem, namely, for $p,q&gt;1$, $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$, any function $h$ belonging to $\mathrm{PW}^1_{2a}$ can be represented as $$h=\sum_{k\geqslant 0}f_k\bar{g}_k,\qquad f_k\in\mathrm{PW}_a^p,\,g_k\in\mathrm{PW}_a^q.$$</description>
