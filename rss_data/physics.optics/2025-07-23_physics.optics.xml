      <title>Hyperparameter-free minimum-lengthscale constraints for topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric constraints of Zhou et al. (2015) are a widely used technique in topology/freeform optimization to impose minimum lengthscales for manufacturability. However, its efficacy degrades as design binarization is increased, and it requires heuristic tuning of multiple hyperparameters. In this work, we derive analytical hyperparameters from first principles, depending only on the target lengthscale. We present results for both conic and PDE-based filtering schemes, showing that the latter is less robust due to the singularity of its underlying Green's function. To address this, we also introduce a double-filtering approach to obtain a well-behaved PDE-based filter. Combined with our derived hyperparameters, we obtain a straightforward strategy for enforcing lengthscales using geometric constraints, with minimal hyperparameter tuning. A key enabling factor is the recent subpixel-smooth projection (SSP) method (Hammond et al. 2025), which facilitates the rapidly-converging optimization of almost-everywhere binary designs. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated for several photonics and heat-transfer inverse-design problems.</description>

      <title>1T'-MoTe$_2$ as an integrated saturable absorber for photonic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the saturable absorption behavior of a 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer integrated with a silicon nitride waveguide for applications in photonic neural networks. Using experimental transmission measurements and theoretical modeling, we characterize the nonlinear response of the material. Our model, incorporating quasi-Fermi level separation and carrier dynamics, successfully explains these behaviors and predicts the material's absorption dependence on the carrier density. Furthermore, we demonstrate a coupling efficiency of up to 20% between the 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer and the silicon nitride waveguide, with saturation achievable at input powers as low as a few uW. These results suggest that 1T'-MoTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for implementing nonlinear functions in integrated photonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Broadband coherent Raman spectroscopy based on single-pulse spectral-domain ghost imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy plays a vital role in chemical sensing and label-free vibrational imaging, yet conventional methods suffer from limited acquisition speeds and complex detection schemes. Here, we demonstrate high-speed broadband CARS enabled by nonlinear spectral ghost imaging combined with time-stretch dispersive Fourier-transform spectroscopy (TS-DFT). We exploit modulation instability to generate a stochastic supercontinuum as the Stokes source and a synchronized narrowband pulse as the pump. Reference Stokes spectra are captured at 60.5 MHz via TS-DFT, while anti-Stokes signals are detected using a single non-spectrally resolving photodetector. Correlating these signals enables broadband CARS spectral reconstruction across the fingerprint (600-1600 cm-1) and C-H stretching (2600-3400 cm-1) regions with 13 cm-1 resolution and microsecond-scale acquisition times. Our method enables robust signal recovery without the need for spectral resolution in the detection path, facilitating measurements in complex biological and chemical environments.</description>

      <title>Broadband Emission via a Photon Avalanche in a Lanthanide-Trimesic Acid Metal-Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared-triggered photon upconversion in porous materials presents intriguing prospects for combined functionalities such as molecular sponge, energy harvesting and conversion functionalities. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most versatile classes of porous crystals. So far only two-photon upconverting processes have been realized in MOFs both by ligand based triplet-triplet annihilation and directly in lanthanide ions. Here we report on Yb3+/Er3+-trimesate-based MOFs that exhibit photon avalanche (PA) characteristics. The PA process conventionally occurs through cross-relaxation within the lanthanide emitter manifold. In contrast, here PA proceeds in the organic molecule part and relies on a cooperative process, involving multiple emission centers. The IR photons are first absorbed and upconverted into high energy electronic population by the action of the lanthanide ions (Yb3+ and Er3+ are the sensitizer and the activator, respectively). Subsequently, the electrons are funneled into electronically coupled triplet states of the trimesate ligand, enabling accumulation in the organic matrix. This reservoir acts as source for a highly nonlinear spectrally broadband emission, arising mainly from ligand triplet states. The nonlinearity factor is comparable with the well-established PA inorganic nanoparticles. We prove that the PA is strongly related to the degree of crystallinity of the MOF: not well-formed frameworks support only the characteristic Er3+ emission with only linear increase as a function of the excitation power. Our work paves a path towards vastly expanding the range of materials exhibiting PA, well beyond a limited set of lanthanide ions. Moreover, it provides a path for much broader control of the PA emission characteristics.</description>

      <title>A phase-modulation interferometer for intense, ultrashort, near infrared laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of coherent phenomena in strong-field processes requires interferometric measurement schemes with high selectivity to disentangle the complex nonlinear response of the system. Interferometers combining acousto-optical phase modulation with lock-in detection feature excellent dynamic range and highly selective detection, thus providing a promising solution. However, acousto-optical modulators (AOMs) cause several issues when operated with intense, ultrashort, near infrared (NIR) laser pulses. The AOMs introduce temporal and angular dispersion, self-phase modulation and reduced acousto-optic efficiency at NIR wavelengths. Here, we present an acousto-optical phase modulation interferometer design that solves these issues. The presented solutions pave the way for the investigation of strong-field processes with phasemodulated interferometry and are also useful to improve the performance of phase-modulation interferometers in other applications.</description>

      <title>Modulation of sub-optical cycle photocurrents in an ultrafast near-infrared scanning tunnelling microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightwave-driven scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) at near-IR frequencies promises an unprecedented combination of atomic spatial resolution and temporal resolution approaching the attosecond range. To achieve this goal, high-sensitivity optical control and detection of sub-cycle tunnelling currents must be achieved at the STM junction. Here, we demonstrate the generation and detection of coherent ultrafast currents across the junction of an STM illuminated by near-infrared single-cycle pulses. We introduce a novel modulation scheme that avoids time-dependent thermal loading while selectively isolating carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-dependent photocurrents. All artifacts arising from periodic modulation of laser power and thermal coupling are efficiently suppressed, enabling a clean readout of the coherent portion of the ultrafast tunneling current.</description>

      <title>Single-layer silicon metalens for broadband achromatic focusing and wide field of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving simultaneous broadband achromatic focusing and a wide field of view remains a significant challenge for metalenses. In this work, we begin with a quadratic phase profile, enabling full field-of-view designs, and apply dispersion engineering to minimize variations of the focal length across wavelengths, thereby substantially reducing both longitudinal and transverse chromatic aberrations. This is accomplished using only the propagation phase in waveguide-like rectangular meta-atoms, without relying on geometric phase contributions. The fabricated singlet metalens experimentally demonstrates a field of view of 86{\textdegree}, along with a tenfold reduction in focal length variations with wavelength compared to a conventional quadratic metalens, achieving a measured relative shift as low as 1.3% across the 1.5 $\mu$m - 1.6 $\mu$m range (limited by our experimental setup). This improvement also leads to a twofold increase in focusing efficiency relative to the reference metalens. These experimental results validate the effectiveness of our design strategy in simultaneously enhancing the operational bandwidth and field of view of metalenses. The demonstrated performance can directly benefit beam steering applications in the near-infrared wavelength range and provides a path toward achromatic, wide field-of-view metalenses in the visible range for imaging systems</description>

      <title>Rough Fabry-Perot cavity: a vastly multi-scale numerical problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A commercial Fabry-Perot laser diode is characterized by highly disproportionate dimensions, which poses a significant numerical challenge, even for state-of-the-art tools. This challenge is exacerbated when one of the cavity mirrors is rough-ened, as is the case when fabricating random laser diodes. Such a system involves length scales from several hundred mi-crometres (length) to a few nanometres (roughness) all of which are relevant when studying optical properties in the visi-ble. While involving an extreme range of dimensions, these cavities cannot be treated through statistical approaches such as those used with self-similar fractal structures known to show well-studied properties. Here we deploy numerical meth-ods to compute cavity modes and show how random corrugations of the Fabry-Perot cavity wall affect statistical proper-ties of their spectral features. Our study constitutes a necessary first step in developing technologically essential devices for photonic computation and efficient speckle-free illumination.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Super-Resolution Imaging Chip based on Miniaturized Full-frequency Encoded-illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A miniaturized full-frequency encoded illumination (mini-FEI) chip is presented for high-throughput super-resolution imaging using the spatial frequency shift (SFS) effect. A tunable full SFS scheme is achieved through propagating and evanescent wave. The multi-illumination modes are precisely and flexibly modulated by an encoded LED array. The light travels to the sample via a set of prisms, producing the super-resolution images with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Mini-FEI super-resolution imaging reaches a resolution of 333 nm (~{\lambda}/4NA), close to the theoretical limit, while maintaining a large field of view (FOV) of ~1 mm2. The method is validated on label-free samples including USAF Target, Star Target, and onion root tip cells, all of which could be successfully reconstructed. Through the introduction of integrated LED arrays for evanescent wave excitation, expensive laser systems can be avoided and the system significantly miniaturized. The mini-FEI super-resolution imaging chip is simple and cost effective to fabricate and can be used in conjunction with any inverted brightfield microscope frame and thus has great potential for widespread use in scientific and industrial research environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonparaxial, monochromatic light the electric and magnetic fields generally have different energy densities, different singularities and different polarisation structures. A topological picture of the electric field or magnetic field in isolation cannot capture the elusive topology of nonparaxial light that exists in the spatially dependent relationship between the two fields: the degree to which light breaks fundamental symmetries (parity, duality, time-reversal). With this work a new ellipse is introduced that resides not in real space, but in electric-magnetic (EM) space, and whose geometry depends on these broken symmetries. The EM ellipse has circular and linear polarisation singularities and may be organised into particle-like textures. These thus-far hidden topologies are present even in rudimentary structured waves, for a second-order EM-space meron is shown to be present in a focussed linearly polarised vortex beam.</description>

      <title>Tunneling driven by quantum light described via field Bohmian trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent realization of an intense quantum light, namely bright squeezed vacuum, opened a new perspective on quantum light-matter interaction. Several theoretical works have appeared based on coherent state expansions of quantum state of light to investigate non-classical driving of high-harmonic generation in atomic gases and solids, or free-electron dynamics, but their predictions surprisingly coincide with what one could expect from essentially classical interpretations of the light statistics. A deeper theoretical insight into the underlying physics is necessary for understanding of observed experimental findings and predicting emerging effects relying on this new configuration. Here we present a theoretical framework to describe tunneling driven by quantum light, where the properties of such light are captured by a statistical ensemble of classical fields via a hydrodynamic, also referred to as Bohmian, formulation. Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling driven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of tunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one realization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on the measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian trajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the electron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical) real classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical approach. To illustrate this, we consider BSV-induced electron transport from the tip to the surface in the tunneling microscope configuration demonstrating the transition from the multiphoton to the direct tunneling regime.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in continuous waves, dark solitons, and vortices in linearly coupled bimodal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model governing the copropagation of two components which represent circular polarizations of light in the optical fiber with relative strength g = 2 of the nonlinear repulsion between the components, and linear coupling between them. A more general system of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations, with g =/= 2 and the linear mixing between the components, is considered too. The latter system is introduced in its one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) forms. A new finding is the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of bimodal CW (continuous-wave) states in the case of g &gt; 1 (in the absence of the linear coupling, it corresponds to the immiscibility of the nonlinearly interacting components). The SSB is represented by an exact asymmetric CW solution. An exact solution is also found, in the case of g = 3, for stable dark solitons (DSs) supported by the asymmetric CW background. For g =/= 3, numerical solutions are produced for stable DSs supported by the same background. Moreover, we identify a parameter domain where the fully miscible (symmetric) CW background maintains stable DSs with the inner SSB (separation between the components) in its core. In 2D, the GP system produces stable vortex states with a shift between the components and broken isotropy. The vortices include ones with the inter-component shift imposed by the asymmetric CW background, and states supported by the symmetric background, in which the intrinsic shift (splitting) is exhibited by vortical cores of the two components.</description>

      <title>Engineering Non-Hermitian Quantum Evolution Using a Hermitian Bath Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering quantum bath networks through non-Hermitian subsystem Hamiltonians has recently emerged as a promising strategy for qubit cooling, state stabilization, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, scaling these systems while maintaining precise control over their complex interconnections, especially in the optical domain, poses significant challenges in both theoretical modeling and physical implementation. In this work, drawing on principles from quantum and mathematical physics, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing non-Hermitian subsystems within entirely Hermitian photonic platforms. In particular, controlled exponential decay without actual absorption loss is realized in finite 1-D waveguide chains through discrete-to-continuum coupling and Lanczos transformations. Using this new methodology, we implement parity-time symmetric quantum systems and experimentally demonstrate that these artificial bath environments accurately replicate the dynamics of non-Hermitian arrangements in both single- and multi-photon excitation regimes. Since the non-Hermitian subsystem response deterministically arises from an artificially built Hermitian bath, the quantum evolution can be monitored via post-selection in this fully conservative configuration. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental realizations, thus paving the way for exploiting quantum bath engineering in advanced information processing and emerging quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: The concept of pseudo-spin provides a general framework for describing physical systems featuring two-component spinors, including light polarization, sublattice degrees of freedom in bipartite lattices, and valley polarization in 2D materials. In all cases, the pseudo-spin can be mapped to a Stokes vector on the Poincar\'e sphere. Stokes polarimeters for measuring the polarization of light are a powerful tool with a wide range of applications both in classical and quantum science. Generalizing Stokes polarimetry to other spinor degrees of freedom is thus a challenge of prime importance. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a Stokes polarimeter for the sublattice polarization in a bipartite photonic lattice. Our method relies on k-space photoluminescence intensity measurements under controlled phase shifts and attenuations applied independently to each sublattice. We implement our method using honeycomb arrays of coupled microcavities realizing photonic analogs of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. Using our sublattice polarimeter, we reconstruct the Bloch modes in amplitude and phase across the Brillouin zone, achieving sub-linewidth precision in the determination of their eigenenergies, including near band touching points. This enables full access to the system Bloch Hamiltonian and quantum geometric tensor. Our approach can readily be extended to more complex systems with additional internal degrees of freedom, enabling experimental investigations of trigonal warping, Chern insulating phases, and Euler-class topology in multigap systems.</description>

      <title>Probing subradiant dynamics in cold atomic ensembles via population and emitted light measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we report on the time- and space-resolved measurement of subradiant excited state population in an ultra-cold atomic cloud of 174Yb atoms. We use a depletion imaging technique that exploits the V-type internal energy structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms to directly observe the time-resolved spatial distribution of excited state population. We characterize the decay dynamics of the subradiant modes using both the excited state population and scattered light intensity, finding good quantitative agreement with numerical predictions from simulations of two-level atomic ensembles.</description>

      <title>Chemical Treatment-Induced Indirect-to-Direct Bandgap Transition in MoS2: Impact on Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique electrical and optical properties of emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichal-cogenides (TMDs) present compelling advantages over conventional semiconductors, including Si, Ge, and GaAs. Nevertheless, realising the full potential of TMDs in electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as transistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and photodetectors, is con-strained by high contact resistance. This limitation arises from their low intrinsic carrier concen-trations and the current insufficiency of doping strategies for atomically thin materials. Notably, chemical treatment with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) has been demonstrated as an effective post-growth method to enhance the n-type electrical conductivity of TMDs. Despite the well-documented electrical improvements post-DCE treatment, its effects on optical properties, specifically the retention of optical characteristics and excitonic behaviour, are not yet clearly under-stood. Here, we systematically investigate the layer- and time-dependent optical effects of DCE on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. Our PL results reveal a rapid reduction in the indirect bandgap transition, with the direct transition remaining unaffected. DFT confirms that chlorine (Cl) atoms bind to sulphur vacancies, creating mid-gap states that facilitate non-radiative recom-bination, explaining the observed indirect PL suppression. This work demonstrates DCE's utility not only for n-type doping but also for optical band structure engineering in MoS2 by selec-tively suppressing indirect transitions, potentially opening new avenues for 2D optoelectronic device design.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable, low-error dynamic polarization encoding of deterministically generated single photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to inscribe information on single photons at high speeds is a crucial requirement for quantum applications such as quantum communication and measurement-based photonic quantum computation. Nowadays, most experimental implementations employ phase modulators in single-pass, Mach-Zehnder interferometer or Michelson interferometer configurations to encode information on photonic qubits. However, these approaches are intrinsically sensitive to environmental influences, limiting the achievable quantum error rates in practice. We report on the first demonstration of a polarization encoder for single-photon qubits based on a free-space Sagnac interferometer, showcasing inherent phase stability and overcoming previous error rate limitations. Telecom-wavelength single photons emitted by a quantum dot are modulated by the encoder under a repetition rate of 152 MHz. A quantum bit error rate of 0.69(2)% is achieved, marking the lowest error rate reported to date for high-speed information encoding on single photons. This work represents a key advance towards robust, scalable, and low-error quantum information processing with single photon sources.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional perfect absorption induced by chiral coupling in spin-momentum locked waveguide magnonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral coupling opens new avenues for controlling and exploiting light-matter interactions. We demonstrate that chiral coupling can be utilized to achieve unidirectional perfect absorption. In our experiments, chiral magnon-photon coupling is realized by coupling the magnon modes in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres with spin-momentum-locked waveguide modes supported by spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). These photon modes exhibit transverse spin, with the spin direction determined by the propagation direction. Due to the intrinsic spin properties of the magnon mode, it exclusively couples with microwaves traveling in one direction, effectively suppressing the reflection channel. Under the critical coupling condition, transmission is also eliminated, resulting in unidirectional perfect absorption. By incorporating additional YIG spheres, bidirectional and multi-frequency perfect absorption can be achieved. Our work introduces a novel platform for exploring and harnessing chiral light-matter interactions within spin-momentum locked devices, offering a paradigm for unidirectional signal processing and energy harvesting technologies.</description>

      <title>Self-Accelerating Topological Edge States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge states emerging at the boundaries of materials with nontrivial topology are attractive for many practical applications due to their remarkable robustness to disorder and local boundary deformations, which cannot result in scattering of the energy of the edge states impinging on such defects into the bulk of material, as long as forbidden topological gap remains open in its spectrum. The velocity of the such states traveling along the edge of the topological insulator is typically determined by their Bloch momentum. In contrast, here, using valley Hall edge states forming at the domain wall between two honeycomb lattices with broken inversion symmetry, we show that by imposing Airy envelope on them one can construct edge states which, on the one hand, exhibit \textit{self-acceleration} along the boundary of the insulator despite their fixed Bloch momentum and, on the other hand, \textit{do not diffract} along the boundary despite the presence of localized features in their shapes. We construct both linear and nonlinear self-accelerating edge states, and show that nonlinearity considerably affects their envelopes. Such self-accelerating edge states exhibit self-healing properties typical for nondiffracting beams. Self-accelerating valley Hall edge states can circumvent sharp corners, provided the oscillating tail of the self-accelerating topological state is properly apodized by using an exponential function. Our findings open new prospects for control of propagation dynamics of edge excitations in topological insulators and allow to study rich phenomena that may occur upon interactions of nonlinear envelope topological states.</description>

      <title>Uncovering hidden resonances in non-Hermitian systems with scattering thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The points where diffraction orders emerge or vanish in the propagating spectrum of periodic non-Hermitian systems are referred to as scattering thresholds. Close to these branch points, resonances from different Riemann sheets can tremendously impact the optical response. However, these resonances are so far elusive for two reasons. First, their contribution to the signal is partially obscured, and second, they are inaccessible for standard computational methods. Here, the interplay of scattering thresholds with resonances is explored and a multi-valued rational approximation is introduced to access the hidden resonances. The theoretical and numerical approach is used to analyze the resonances of a plasmonic line grating. This work elegantly explains the occurrence of pronounced spectral features at scattering thresholds applicable to many nanophotonic systems of contemporary and future interest.</description>

      <title>Wide-Angle, Multiplexed Backscatter Communications Using a Dynamic Metasurface-Backed Luneburg Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backscatter communications is attractive for its low power requirements due to the lack of actively radiating components; however, commonly used devices are typically limited in range and functionality. Here, we design and demonstrate a backscatter device consisting of a flattened Luneburg lens combined with a spatially-tunable dynamic metasurface. Using quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO), we design a flattened, additively manufactured Luneburg lens that focuses incoming waves over a wide field-of-view onto its flattened focal plane. When a reflective surface is placed at the focal plane, the flattened Luneburg lens retroreflects, enabling long-range backscatter communications over an extremely large field-of-view ($\pm30\degree$) and bandwidth. The dynamic metasurface is designed to modulated the reflected phase across the S-band (2-4 GHz) with fine spatial control. Thus, when combined with the flattened Luneburg lens, the device is able to modulate the retroreflected signal to achieve backscatter communications. We experimentally demonstrate full phase control of the backscattered signal across a range of incidence angles, spatial multiplexing, and secure communications against eavesdroppers by actively suppressing or randomizing signals in unwanted directions. The metasurface-backed Luneburg lens device offers a low-power solution for long-range wireless networks with advanced capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and demonstrate a first-principles approach, based on the nonlinear Maxwell-Bloch equations and steady-state ab-initio laser theory (SALT), for inverse design of nanostructured lasers, incorporating spatial hole-burning corrections, threshold effects, out-coupling efficiency, and gain diffusion. The resulting figure of merit exploits the high-$Q$ regime of optimized laser cavities to perturbatively simplify the nonlinear model to a single linear ''reciprocal'' Maxwell solve. The consequences for laser-cavity design, and in particular the strong dependence on the nature of the gain region, are demonstrated using topology optimization of both 2d and full 3d geometries.</description>
