      <title>Reaching New Heights in Multi-Agent Collective Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for multi-agent collective construction, based on the idea of reversible ramps. Our ReRamp algorithm utilizes reversible side-ramps to generate construction plans for ramped block structures higher and larger than was previously possible using state-of-the-art planning algorithms, given the same building area. We compare the ReRamp algorithm to similar state-of-the-art algorithms on a set of benchmark instances, where we demonstrate its superior computational speed. We also establish in our experiments that the ReRamp algorithm is capable of generating plans for a single-story house, an important milestone on the road to real-world multi-agent construction applications.</description>

      <title>DeepVoting: Learning Voting Rules with Tailored Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregating the preferences of multiple agents into a collective decision is a common step in many important problems across areas of computer science including information retrieval, reinforcement learning, and recommender systems. As Social Choice Theory has shown, the problem of designing algorithms for aggregation rules with specific properties (axioms) can be difficult, or provably impossible in some cases. Instead of designing algorithms by hand, one can learn aggregation rules, particularly voting rules, from data. However, the prior work in this area has required extremely large models, or been limited by the choice of preference representation, i.e., embedding. We recast the problem of designing a good voting rule into one of learning probabilistic versions of voting rules that output distributions over a set of candidates. Specifically, we use neural networks to learn probabilistic social choice functions from the literature. We show that embeddings of preference profiles derived from the social choice literature allows us to learn existing voting rules more efficiently and scale to larger populations of voters more easily than other work if the embedding is tailored to the learning objective. Moreover, we show that rules learned using embeddings can be tweaked to create novel voting rules with improved axiomatic properties. Namely, we show that existing voting rules require only minor modification to combat a probabilistic version of the No Show Paradox.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Collaboration of LLM based Agents for Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interactions between multiple agents within Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of programming and coding tasks. We utilize the AutoGen framework to facilitate communication among agents, evaluating different configurations based on the success rates from 40 random runs for each setup. The study focuses on developing a flexible automation framework for applying the Finite Element Method (FEM) to solve linear elastic problems. Our findings emphasize the importance of optimizing agent roles and clearly defining their responsibilities, rather than merely increasing the number of agents. Effective collaboration among agents is shown to be crucial for addressing general FEM challenges. This research demonstrates the potential of LLM multi-agent systems to enhance computational automation in simulation methodologies, paving the way for future advancements in engineering and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Training for Enhanced Multi-task Generalization in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving multi-task generalization to diverse agents and objectives presents significant challenges. Existing online MARL algorithms primarily focus on single-task performance, but their lack of multi-task generalization capabilities typically results in substantial computational waste and limited real-life applicability. Meanwhile, existing offline multi-task MARL approaches are heavily dependent on data quality, often resulting in poor performance on unseen tasks. In this paper, we introduce HyGen, a novel hybrid MARL framework, Hybrid Training for Enhanced Multi-Task Generalization, which integrates online and offline learning to ensure both multi-task generalization and training efficiency. Specifically, our framework extracts potential general skills from offline multi-task datasets. We then train policies to select the optimal skills under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm (CTDE). During this stage, we utilize a replay buffer that integrates both offline data and online interactions. We empirically demonstrate that our framework effectively extracts and refines general skills, yielding impressive generalization to unseen tasks. Comparative analyses on the StarCraft multi-agent challenge show that HyGen outperforms a wide range of existing solely online and offline methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Target Assignment and Path Finding for Intelligent Warehouse: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent target assignment and path planning (TAPF) are two key problems in intelligent warehouse. However, most literature only addresses one of these two problems separately. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously solve target assignment and path planning from a perspective of cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the TAPF problem for intelligent warehouse to cooperative multi-agent deep RL, and the first to simultaneously address TAPF based on multi-agent deep RL. Furthermore, previous literature rarely considers the physical dynamics of agents. In this study, the physical dynamics of the agents is considered. Experimental results show that our method performs well in various task settings, which means that the target assignment is solved reasonably well and the planned path is almost shortest. Moreover, our method is more time-efficient than baselines.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Control in Standard Borel Spaces: Centralized MDP Reductions, Near Optimality of Finite Window Local Information, and Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized stochastic control problems are intrinsically difficult to study because of the inapplicability of standard tools from centralized control such as dynamic programming and the resulting computational complexity. In this paper, we address some of these challenges for decentralized stochastic control with Borel spaces under three different but tightly related information structures under a unified theme: the one-step delayed information sharing pattern, the K-step periodic information sharing pattern, and the completely decentralized information structure where no sharing of information occurs. We will show that the one-step delayed and K-step periodic problems can be reduced to a centralized MDP, generalizing prior results which considered finite, linear, or static models, by addressing several measurability questions. The separated nature of policies under both information structures is then established. We then provide sufficient conditions for the transition kernels of both centralized reductions to be weak-Feller, which facilitates rigorous approximation and learning theoretic results. We will then show that for the completely decentralized control problem finite memory local policies are near optimal under a joint conditional mixing condition. This is achieved by obtaining a bound for finite memory policies which goes to zero as memory size increases. We will also provide a performance bound for the K-periodic problem, which results from replacing the full common information by a finite sliding window of information. The latter will depend on the condition of predictor stability in expected total variation, which we will establish. We finally show that under the periodic information sharing pattern, a quantized Q-learning algorithm converges asymptotically towards a near optimal solution. Each of the above, to our knowledge, is a new contribution to the literature.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles and robot swarms hold transformative potential for enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability in the transportation and manufacturing sectors. Extensive testing and validation of these technologies is crucial for their deployment in the real world. While simulations are essential for initial testing, they often have limitations in capturing the complex dynamics of real-world interactions. This limitation underscores the importance of small-scale testbeds. These testbeds provide a realistic, cost-effective, and controlled environment for testing and validating algorithms, acting as an essential intermediary between simulation and full-scale experiments. This work serves to facilitate researchers' efforts in identifying existing small-scale testbeds suitable for their experiments and provide insights for those who want to build their own. In addition, it delivers a comprehensive survey of the current landscape of these testbeds. We derive 62 characteristics of testbeds based on the well-known sense-plan-act paradigm and offer an online table comparing 22 small-scale testbeds based on these characteristics. The online table is hosted on our designated public webpage www.cpm-remote.de/testbeds, and we invite testbed creators and developers to contribute to it. We closely examine nine testbeds in this paper, demonstrating how the derived characteristics can be used to present testbeds. Furthermore, we discuss three ongoing challenges concerning small-scale testbeds that we identified, i.e., small-scale to full-scale transition, sustainability, and power and resource management.</description>

      <title>Locally Differentially Private Distributed Online Learning with Guaranteed Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed online learning is gaining increased traction due to its unique ability to process large-scale datasets and streaming data. To address the growing public awareness and concern on privacy protection, plenty of algorithms have been proposed to enable differential privacy in distributed online optimization and learning. However, these algorithms often face the dilemma of trading learning accuracy for privacy. By exploiting the unique characteristics of online learning, this paper proposes an approach that tackles the dilemma and ensures both differential privacy and learning accuracy in distributed online learning. More specifically, while ensuring a diminishing expected instantaneous regret, the approach can simultaneously ensure a finite cumulative privacy budget, even in the infinite time horizon. To cater for the fully distributed setting, we adopt the local differential-privacy framework, which avoids the reliance on a trusted data curator that is required in the classic "centralized" (global) differential-privacy framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that successfully ensures both rigorous local differential privacy and learning accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using machine learning tasks, including logistic regression on the the "mushrooms" datasets and CNN-based image classification on the "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10" datasets.</description>

      <title>Keeping the Harmony Between Neighbors: Local Fairness in Graph Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating indivisible resources under the connectivity constraints of a graph $G$. This model, initially introduced by Bouveret et al. (published in IJCAI, 2017), effectively encompasses a diverse array of scenarios characterized by spatial or temporal limitations, including the division of land plots and the allocation of time plots. In this paper, we introduce a novel fairness concept that integrates local comparisons within the social network formed by a connected allocation of the item graph. Our particular focus is to achieve pairwise-maximin fair share (PMMS) among the "neighbors" within this network. For any underlying graph structure, we show that a connected allocation that maximizes Nash welfare guarantees a $(1/2)$-PMMS fairness. Moreover, for two agents, we establish that a $(3/4)$-PMMS allocation can be efficiently computed. Additionally, we demonstrate that for three agents and the items aligned on a path, a PMMS allocation is always attainable and can be computed in polynomial time. Lastly, when agents have identical additive utilities, we present a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for a $(3/4)$-PMMS allocation, irrespective of the underlying graph $G$. Furthermore, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for obtaining a PMMS allocation when $G$ is a tree.</description>

      <title>Combining Safe Intervals and RRT* for Efficient Multi-Robot Path Planning in Complex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of Multi-Robot Path Planning (MRPP) in continuous space to find conflict-free paths. The difficulty of the problem arises from two primary factors. First, the involvement of multiple robots leads to combinatorial decision-making, which escalates the search space exponentially. Second, the continuous space presents potentially infinite states and actions. For this problem, we propose a two-level approach where the low level is a sampling-based planner Safe Interval RRT* (SI-RRT*) that finds a collision-free trajectory for individual robots. The high level can use any method that can resolve inter-robot conflicts where we employ two representative methods that are Prioritized Planning (SI-CPP) and Conflict Based Search (SI-CCBS). Experimental results show that SI-RRT* can find a high-quality solution quickly with a small number of samples. SI-CPP exhibits improved scalability while SI-CCBS produces higher-quality solutions compared to the state-of-the-art planners for continuous space. Compared to the most scalable existing algorithm, SI-CPP achieves a success rate that is up to 94% higher with 100 robots while maintaining solution quality (i.e., flowtime, the sum of travel times of all robots) without significant compromise. SI-CPP also decreases the makespan up to 45%. SI-CCBS decreases the flowtime by 9% compared to the competitor, albeit exhibiting a 14% lower success rate.</description>

      <title>Compressed Federated Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently gained unprecedented popularity, yet it still grapples with sample inefficiency. Addressing this challenge, federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) has emerged, wherein agents collaboratively learn a single policy by aggregating local estimations. However, this aggregation step incurs significant communication costs. In this paper, we propose CompFedRL, a communication-efficient FedRL approach incorporating both \textit{periodic aggregation} and (direct/error-feedback) compression mechanisms. Specifically, we consider compressed federated $Q$-learning with a generative model setup, where a central server learns an optimal $Q$-function by periodically aggregating compressed $Q$-estimates from local agents. For the first time, we characterize the impact of these two mechanisms (which have remained elusive) by providing a finite-time analysis of our algorithm, demonstrating strong convergence behaviors when utilizing either direct or error-feedback compression. Our bounds indicate improved solution accuracy concerning the number of agents and other federated hyperparameters while simultaneously reducing communication costs. To corroborate our theory, we also conduct in-depth numerical experiments to verify our findings, considering Top-$K$ and Sparsified-$K$ sparsification operators.</description>
