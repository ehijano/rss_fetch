      <title>Proposal for realizing quantum-spin systems on a two-dimensional square lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by the Floquet engineering using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis loops in spinor BECs subject to synthetic gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the hysteretic dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms loaded in static 2D ring geometries and subjected to varying synthetic magnetic fields. Electrically neutral, pseudo-spin-$1/2$ condensates are probed by one-component weak-link potentials that make available paths for the transit of vortices into and out of the ring in both components, and thus can control the number of flux quanta threading the ring hole. For perpendicular fields, domain walls that are dynamically generated in the relative phase of the spin components are shown to play a key role in driving the hysteretic behaviour of the whole system through changes in the net magnetic flux. In the presence of spin-orbit-coupling, hysteresis is exhibited around the phase transitions found by the metastable current states for varying fields.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $s$-wave scattering length between metastable helium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental determination of the interspecies $s$-wave scattering length\,($a_{34}$) between the $2\,^3S_1\,(F=3/2,m_F=3/2)$ state of $^3$He$^*$ and the $2\,^3S_1\,(m_J=1)$ state of $^4$He$^*$. We determine $a_{34}$ by inducing oscillations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate of $^4$He$^*$ and measuring the damping rate of these oscillations due to the presence of $^3$He$^*$ atoms. The deduced value of $a_{34}=29\pm3$\,nm is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The knowledge of this scattering length is important for many fundamental experiments between these helium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Exotic Kondo effect in two one dimensional spin 1/2 chains coupled to two localized spin 1/2 magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an exotic Kondo effect in a system consisting of two one-dimensional XX Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin $1/2$ chains (denoted by $\alpha = u, d$ for up and down chains) coupled to a quantum dot consisting of two localized spin $1/2$ magnets. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian of the two chains, this system can be expressed in terms of non-interacting spinless fermionic quasiparticles. As a result, the Hamiltonian of the whole system is expressed as an Anderson model for spin 1/2 fermions interacting with a spin-1/2 impurity. Thus, we study the scattering of fermionic quasiparticles (propagating along spin chains) by a pair of localized magnetic impurities. At low temperature, the localized spin $1/2$ magnets are shielded by the chain `spins' via the Kondo effect. We calculate the Kondo temperature $T_K$ and derive the temperature dependence of the entropy, the specific heat, the specific heat and the `magnetic susceptibility' of the dot for $T \gg T_K$. Our results can be generalized to the case of anti-ferromagnetic XX chains.</description>

      <title>Extracting Off-Diagonal Order from Diagonal Basis Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy has developed into a powerful tool to explore strongly correlated quantum systems. However, discerning phases with topological or off-diagonal long range order requires the ability to extract these correlations from site-resolved measurements. Here, we show that a multi-scale complexity measure can pinpoint the transition to and from the bond ordered wave phase of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model with an off-diagonal order parameter, sandwiched between diagonal charge and spin density wave phases, using only diagonal descriptors. We study the model directly in the thermodynamic limit using the recently developed variational uniform matrix product states algorithm, and draw our samples from degenerate ground states related by global spin rotations, emulating the projective measurements that are accessible in experiments. Our results will have important implications for the study of exotic phases using optical lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson junctions and synchronized precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>

      <title>Probing Penrose-type singularities in sonic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing the general question whether Penrose singularities physically exist inside black holes, we investigate the problem in the context of an analogue system, a flowing laboratory liquid, for which the governing equations are at least in principle known to all relevant scales, and in all regions of the effective spacetime. We suggest to probe the physical phenomena taking place close to the singularity in the interior of a $2+1$D analogue black hole arising from a polytropic, inviscid, irrotational, and axisymmetric steady flow, and propose to this end an experimental setup in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Our study provides concrete evidence, for a well understood dynamical system, that the Einstein equations are not necessary for a singularity to form, demonstrating that Penrose-type spacetime singularities can potentially also exist in non-Einsteinian theories of gravity. Finally, we demonstrate how the singularity is physically avoided in our proposed laboratory setup.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram with the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>
