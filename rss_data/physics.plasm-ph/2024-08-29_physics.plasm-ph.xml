      <title>Diffusive transport of a 2-D magnetized dusty plasma cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty plasma medium turns out to be an ideal system for studying the strongly coupled behavior of matter. The large size and slow response make their dynamics suitable to be captured through simple diagnostic tools. Furthermore, as the charge on individual particles is significantly higher than the electronic charge, the interaction amongst them can be in a strong coupling regime even at room temperatures and normal densities. Such charged dust particles are often present in several industrial plasma-based processes and can have a detrimental influence. For instance, in magnetrons, the sputtering phenomena may be affected by the accumulation of charged impurity clusters. The objective here is to understand the transport behavior of these particles in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. For this purpose, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed using an open-source large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS). The dependence of the transport coefficient on the applied magnetic field and prevalent collisional processes has been discerned through simulations in detail.</description>

      <title>Electron Acceleration at Quasi-parallel Non-relativistic Shocks: A 1D Kinetic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a survey of 1D kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-parallel non-relativistic shocks to identify the environments favorable for electron acceleration. We explore an unprecedented range of shock speeds $v_{\rm sh}\approx 0.067-0.267\,c$, Alfv\'{e}n Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A} = 5-40$, sonic Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}_{\rm s} = 5-160$, as well as the proton-to-electron mass ratios $m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm e}=16-1836$. We find that high Alfv\'{e}n Mach number shocks can channel a large fraction of their kinetic energy into nonthermal particles, self-sustaining magnetic turbulence and acceleration to larger and larger energies. The fraction of injected particles is $\lesssim 0.5\%$ for electrons and $\approx 1\%$ for protons, and the corresponding energy efficiencies are $\lesssim 2\%$ and $\approx 10\%$, respectively. The extent of the nonthermal tail is sensitive to the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number; when $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A}\lesssim 10$, the nonthermal electron distribution exhibits minimal growth beyond the average momentum of the downstream thermal protons, independently of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Acceleration is slow for shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, yet nonthermal electrons still achieve momenta exceeding the downstream thermal proton momentum when the shock Alfv\'{e}n Mach number is large enough. We provide simulation-based parametrizations of the transition from thermal to nonthermal distribution in the downstream (found at a momentum around $p_{\rm i,e}/m_{\rm i}v_{\rm sh} \approx 3\sqrt{m_{\rm i,e}/m_{\rm i}}$), as well as the ratio of nonthermal electron to proton number density. The results are applicable to many different environments and are important for modeling shock-powered nonthermal radiation.</description>

      <title>Validation of Thin-foil proton recoil neutron spectrometer prototype for application in high yield DT fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Thin-foil Proton Recoil (TPR) spectrometers for application in neutron spectroscopy is of high relevance for future fusion devices such as ITER, where neutron spectroscopy will play a crucial role in fuel content monitoring. Existing research based on simulations of the performance of TPR spectrometers at ITER has demonstrated positive results. However, experimental validation of the simulations would greatly benefit the reliability of conclusions. In this study, we designed and constructed a prototype TPR neutron spectrometer and employed a DT neutron generator as a neutron source to perform measurements. We compared the experimental results with the simulation results using the Geant4 model of the experiment. The simulation and experimental results match within silicon detector intrinsic energy resolution. This approach ensures the experimental validation of the Geant4 based simulations of the TPR spectrometer. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing nuclear reactions measured in silicon detectors, specifically $^{28}$Si(n,d) and $^{28}$Si(n,$\alpha$), for energy calibration purposes. A comparison of the experiment and the simulation shows that the mean peak energy and full width at half maximum are within 150 keV. The calculated detector efficiency underestimates the experimentally determined efficiency up to 33\%. Discrepancies in the measured energy spectrum indicate the need for a more refined model and experiment control. Overall, the successful validation of the developed Geant4 simulation model against the experimentally measured energy spectra increases confidence in the applicability of such simulation results in other devices. The demonstrated energy calibration highlights new possibilities for neutron spectrometer monitoring during operation at ITER.</description>

      <title>Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter and Hot Dense Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity", that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</description>

      <title>Direct Microstability Optimization of Stellarator Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent transport is regarded as one of the key issues in magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, both for tokamaks in stellarators. In this work, we show that a significant decrease in a microstability-based proxy, as opposed to a geometric one, for the turbulent heat flux, namely the quasilinear heat flux, can be obtained in an efficient manner by coupling stellarator optimization with linear gyrokinetic simulations. This is accomplished by computing the quasi-linear heat flux at each step of the optimization process, as well as the deviation from quasisymmetry, and minimizing their sum, leading to a balance between neoclassical and turbulent transport proxy.</description>

      <title>Inertial range of magnetorotational turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion disks around compact stars are formed due to turbulence driven by magnetorotational instability. Despite over thirty years of numerous computational studies on magnetorotational turbulence, the properties of fluctuations in the inertial range -- where cross-scale energy transfer dominates over energy injection -- have remained elusive, primarily due to insufficient numerical resolution. Here, we report the highest-resolution simulation of magnetorotational turbulence ever conducted. Our simulations reveal a constant cross-scale energy flux, a hallmark of the inertial range. We found that as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the inertial range, the kinetic and magnetic energies tend toward equipartitioning with the same spectral slope, and slow-magnetosonic fluctuations dominate over Alfv\'enic fluctuations, possessing twice the energy. These findings align remarkably with the theoretical expectations from the reduced magnetohydrodynamic model, which assumes a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field. Our results provide important implications for interpreting the radio observations by the Event Horizon Telescope.</description>

      <title>A new formulation of strong-field magnetohydrodynamics for neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>
