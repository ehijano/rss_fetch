      <title>Madgraph on GPUs and vector CPUs: towards production (The 5-year journey to the first LO release CUDACPP v1.00.00)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effort to speed up the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO generator by exploiting CPU vectorization and GPUs, which started at the beginning of 2020, has delivered the first production release of the code for leading-order (LO) processes in October 2024. To achieve this goal, many new features, tests and fixes have been implemented in recent months. This process benefitted also from the early feedback of the CMS experiment. In this contribution, we report on these activities and on the status of the LO software at the time of CHEP2024.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based parametrization of the resolution function for the first experimental area (EAR1) of the n_TOF facility at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses a challenge of parametrizing a resolution function of the neutron beam from the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN. A difficulty stems from a fact that a resolution function exhibits rather strong variations in shape, over approximately 10 orders of magnitude in neutron energy. In order to avoid a need for a manual identification of the appropriate analytical forms - hindering past attempts at its parametrization - we take advantage of the versatile machine learning techniques. In particular, we parametrize it by training a multilayer feedforward neural network, relying on a key idea that such networks act as the universal approximators. The proof of concept is presented for a resolution function for the first experimental area of the n_TOF facility, from the third phase of its operation. We propose an optimal network structure for a resolution function in question, which is also expected to be optimal or near-optimal for other experimental areas and for different phases of n_TOF operation. In order to reconstruct several resolution function forms in common use from a single parametrized form, we provide a practical tool in the form of a specialized C++ class encapsulating the computationally efficient procedures suited to the task. Specifically, the class allows an application of a user-specified temporal spread of a primary proton beam (from a neutron production process at n_TOF) to a desired resolution function form.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has been widely adopted for computing a small subset of extreme eigenvalues in large sparse matrices. This work introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as R-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while maintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional Chebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates, the R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector products, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized eigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale generalized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where exact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally expensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the matrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage modern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging low-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and thousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$, even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems, where approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to ten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation errors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing environments.</description>

      <title>Dynasor 2: From Simulation to Experiment Through Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions, such as static and dynamic structure factors, offer a versatile approach to analyzing atomic-scale structure and dynamics. By having access to the full dynamics from atomistic simulations, they serve as valuable tools for understanding material behavior. Experimentally, material properties are commonly probed through scattering measurements, which also provide access to static and dynamic structure factors. However, it is not trivial to decode these due to complex interactions between atomic motion and the probe. Atomistic simulations can help bridge this gap, allowing for detailed understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we illustrate how correlation functions provide structural and dynamical insights from simulation and showcase the strong agreement with experiment. To compute the correlation functions, we have updated the Python package dynasor with a new interface and, importantly, added support for weighting the computed quantities with form factors or cross sections, facilitating direct comparison with probe-specific structure factors. Additionally, we have incorporated the spectral energy density method, which offers an alternative view of the dispersion for crystalline systems, as well as functionality to project atomic dynamics onto phonon modes, enabling detailed analysis of specific phonon modes from atomistic simulation. We illustrate the capabilities of dynasor with diverse examples, ranging from liquid Ni3Al to perovskites, and compare computed results with X-ray, electron and neutron scattering experiments. This highlights how computed correlation functions can not only agree well with experimental observations, but also provide deeper insight into the atomic-scale structure and dynamics of a material.</description>

      <title>Ground states of quasi-two-dimensional correlated systems via energy expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Investigation of Auxetic Piezoelectric Effect in Nitride Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently reported auxetic piezoelectric effect, which acts as the electrical counterpart of the negative Poisson's ratio, is of significant technical importance for applications in acoustic wave devices. However, this electric auxetic effect has not yet been reported in perovskite systems. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the piezoelectric properties of six polar nitride perovskites with the chemical formula ABN3 (A = La, Sc, Y; B = W, Mo). Among these, all compounds except ScMoN3 exhibit the auxetic piezoelectric effect, which is characterized by an unusually positive transverse piezoelectric coefficient, along with a positive longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient. This behavior is in sharp contrast to previously reported results in HfO2, where both the longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric coefficients are negative. These unusual positive transverse piezoelectric coefficients originate from the domination of the positive internal-strain contribution. We further confirm the auxetic piezoelectric effect with finite electric field calculations. Our research enriches the understanding of the piezoelectric properties of nitride perovskites and provides a new compositional space for the design of novel auxetic piezoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>A Morphotropic Phase Boundary in MA$_{1-x}$FA$_x$PbI$_3$: Linking Structure, Dynamics, and Electronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the phase behavior of mixed-cation halide perovskites is critical for optimizing their structural stability and optoelectronic performance. Here, we map the phase diagram of MA$_{1-x}$FA$_x$PbI$_3$ using a machine-learned interatomic potential in molecular dynamics simulations. We identify a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) at approximately 27% FA content, delineating the transition between out-of-phase and in-phase octahedral tilt patterns. Phonon mode projections reveal that this transition coincides with a mode crossover composition, where the free energy landscapes of the M and R phonon modes become nearly degenerate. This results in nanoscale layered structures with alternating tilt patterns, suggesting minimal interface energy between competing phases. Our results provide a systematic and consistent description of this important system, complementing earlier partial and sometimes conflicting experimental assessments. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that band edge fluctuations peak near the MPB, indicating an enhancement of electron-phonon coupling and dynamic disorder effects. These findings establish a direct link between phonon dynamics, phase behavior, and electronic structure, providing a further composition-driven pathway for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. By demonstrating that phonon overdamping serves as a hallmark of the MPB, our study offers new insights into the design principles for stable, high-performance perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, 2D materials have rapidly evolved into a diverse and expanding family of material platforms. Many members of this materials class have demonstrated their potential to deliver transformative impact on fundamental research and technological applications across different fields. In this roadmap, we provide an overview of the key aspects of 2D material research and development, spanning synthesis, properties and commercial applications. We specifically present roadmaps for high impact 2D materials, including graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes as well as their heterostructures and moir\'e systems. The discussions are organized into thematic sections covering emerging research areas (e.g., twisted electronics, moir\'e nano-optoelectronics, polaritronics, quantum photonics, and neuromorphic computing), breakthrough applications in key technologies (e.g., 2D transistors, energy storage, electrocatalysis, filtration and separation, thermal management, flexible electronics, sensing, electromagnetic interference shielding, and composites) and other important topics (computational discovery of novel materials, commercialization and standardization). This roadmap focuses on the current research landscape, future challenges and scientific and technological advances required to address, with the intent to provide useful references for promoting the development of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>MixFunn: A Neural Network for Differential Equations with Improved Generalization and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MixFunn, a novel neural network architecture designed to solve differential equations with enhanced precision, interpretability, and generalization capability. The architecture comprises two key components: the mixed-function neuron, which integrates multiple parameterized nonlinear functions to improve representational flexibility, and the second-order neuron, which combines a linear transformation of its inputs with a quadratic term to capture cross-combinations of input variables. These features significantly enhance the expressive power of the network, enabling it to achieve comparable or superior results with drastically fewer parameters and a reduction of up to four orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches. We applied MixFunn in a physics-informed setting to solve differential equations in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving higher accuracy and improved generalization to regions outside the training domain relative to standard machine learning models. Furthermore, the architecture facilitates the extraction of interpretable analytical expressions, offering valuable insights into the underlying solutions.</description>

      <title>Pressure-temperature phase diagram calculations using polynomial machine learning potentials: A comprehensive study based on global structure prediction and self-consistent phonon calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) based on polynomial rotational invariants have been systematically developed for various systems and applied to efficiently predict crystal structures. In this study, we propose a robust methodology founded on polynomial MLPs to comprehensively enumerate crystal structures under high-pressure conditions and to evaluate their phase stability at finite temperatures. The proposed approach involves constructing polynomial MLPs with high predictive accuracy across a broad range of pressures, conducting reliable global structure searches, and performing exhaustive self-consistent phonon calculations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by examining elemental silicon at pressures up to 100 GPa and temperatures up to 1000 K, revealing stable phases across these conditions. The framework established in this study offers a powerful strategy for predicting crystal structures and phase stability under high-pressure and finite-temperature conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer network model recognized for its efficiency in neuromorphic computing, where synapses between neurons are trained linearly. Computations in KAN are performed by generating a polynomial vector from the state vector and layer-wise trained synapses, enabling efficient processing. While KAN can be implemented on quantum computers using block encoding and Quantum Signal Processing, these methods require fault-tolerant quantum devices, making them impractical for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. We propose the Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (EVQKAN) to overcome this limitation, which emulates KAN through variational quantum algorithms. The EVQKAN ansatz employs a tiling technique to emulate layer matrices, leading to significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), even with a smaller number of layers. EVQKAN achieves superior performance with a single-layer architecture, whereas QNN and VQKAN typically struggle. Additionally, EVQKAN eliminates the need for Quantum Signal Processing, enhancing its robustness to noise and making it well-suited for practical deployment on NISQ-era quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Stochastic reduced-order Koopman model for turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stochastic data-driven reduced-order model applicable to a wide range of turbulent natural and engineering flows is presented. Combining ideas from Koopman theory and spectral model order reduction, the stochastic low-dimensional inflated convolutional Koopman model (SLICK) accurately forecasts short-time transient dynamics while preserving long-term statistical properties. A discrete Koopman operator is used to evolve convolutional coordinates that govern the temporal dynamics of spectral orthogonal modes, which in turn represent the energetically most salient large-scale coherent flow structures. Turbulence closure is achieved in two steps: first, by inflating the convolutional coordinates to incorporate nonlinear interactions between different scales, and second, by modeling the residual error as a stochastic source. An empirical dewhitening filter informed by the data is used to maintain the second-order flow statistics within the long-time limit. The model uncertainty is quantified through either Monte Carlo simulation or by directly propagating the model covariance matrix. The model is demonstrated on the Ginzburg-Landau equations, large-eddy simulation (LES) data of a turbulent jet, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) data of the flow over an open cavity. In all cases, the model is predictive over time horizons indicated by a detailed error analysis and integrates stably over arbitrary time horizons, generating realistic surrogate data.</description>

      <title>Predicting rigidity and connectivity percolation in disordered particulate networks using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks can accurately predict the chemical properties of many molecular systems, but their suitability for large, macromolecular assemblies such as gels is unknown. Here, graph neural networks were trained and optimised for two large-scale classification problems: the rigidity of a molecular network, and the connectivity percolation status which is non-trivial to determine for systems with periodic boundaries. Models trained on lattice systems were found to achieve accuracies &gt;95% for rigidity classification, with slightly lower scores for connectivity percolation due to the inherent class imbalance in the data. Dynamically generated off-lattice networks achieved consistently lower accuracies overall due to the correlated nature of the network geometry that was absent in the lattices. An open source tool is provided allowing usage of the highest-scoring trained models, and directions for future improved tools to surmount the challenges limiting accuracy in certain situations are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The high-energy repulsive interaction between nuclei at distances much smaller than the equilibrium bond length is the key quantity determining the nuclear stopping power and atom scattering in keV and MeV radiation events. This interaction is traditionally modeled within orbital-free density functional theory with frozen atomic electron densities, following the Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) model. In this work, we calculate atom pair specific repulsive interatomic potentials with the ZBL model, and compare them to two kinds of quantum chemical calculations - second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory in flexible Gaussian basis sets as well as density functional theory with numerical atomic orbital basis sets - which go well beyond the limitations in the ZBL model, allowing the density to relax in the calculations. We show that the repulsive interatomic potentials predicted by the two quantum chemical models agree within $\sim$ 1% for potential energies above 30 eV, while the ZBL pair-specific potentials and universal ZBL potentials differ much more from either of these calculations. We provide new pair-specific fits of the screening functions in terms of 3 exponentials to the calculations for all pairs $Z_1$-$Z_2$ for $1 \leq Z_i \leq 92$, and show that they agree within $\sim 2$% with the raw data. We use the new potentials to simulate ion implantation depth profiles in single crystalline Si and show very good agreement with experiment. However, we also show that under channeling conditions, the attractive part of the potential can affect the depth profiles. The full data sets of all the calculated interatomic potentials as well as analytic fits to the data are shared as open access.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>

Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>
