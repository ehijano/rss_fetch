      <title>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</description>

      <title>Identifying the onset and decay of quasi-stationary families of almost-invariant sets with an application to atmospheric blocking events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic features of dynamical systems such as almost-invariant sets and coherent sets provide crucial high-level information on how the dynamics organises phase space. We introduce a method to identify time-parameterised families of almost-invariant sets in time-dependent dynamical systems, as well as the families' emergence and disappearance. In contrast to coherent sets, which may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on families of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our straightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for almost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilises the Ulam scheme for the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new methodology is illustrated with an idealised fluid flow and with atmospheric velocity data. We identify atmospheric blocking events in the 2003 European heatwave and compare our technique to existing geophysical methods of blocking diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Natural measures and statistical properties of non-statistical maps with multiple neutral fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we show that a large class of infinite measure preserving dynamical systems that do not admit physical measures nevertheless exhibit strong statistical properties. In particular, we give sufficient conditions for existence of a distinguished natural measure $\nu$ such that the pushforwards of any absolutely continuous probability measure converge to $\nu$. Moreover, we obtain a distributional limit law for empirical measures. We also extend existing results on the characterisation of the set of almost sure limit points for empirical measures. Our results apply to various intermittent maps with multiple neutral fixed points preserving an infinite $\sigma$-finite absolutely continuous measure.</description>

      <title>On Stronger Forms of Expansivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the concept of stronger forms of positively expansive map and name it as $p \:\mathscr{F}-$expansive maps. Here $\mathscr{F}$ is a family of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$. Examples of positively thick expansive and positively syndetic expansive maps are constructed here. Also, we obtain conditions under which a positively expansive map is positively co--finite expansive and positively syndetic expansive maps. Further, we study several properties of $p \:\mathscr{F}-$expansive maps. A characterization of $p \:\mathscr{F}-$expansive maps in terms of $p \:\mathscr{F}^*-$generator is obtained. Here $p \:\mathscr{F}^*$ is dual of $\mathscr{F}$. Considering $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ as a semigroup, we study $\mathscr{F}-$expansive homeomorphism, where $\mathscr{F}$ is a family of subsets of $\mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$. We show that there does not exists an expansive homeomorphism on a compact metric space which is $\mathscr{F}_s-$expansive. Also, we study relation between $\mathscr{F}-$expansivity of $f$ and the shift map $\sigma_f$ on the inverse limit space.</description>

      <title>Dispersal-induced growth or decay in a time-periodic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up to a previous work where we considered populations with time-varying growth rates living in patches and irreducible migration matrix between the patches. Each population, when isolated, would become extinct. Dispersal-induced growth (DIG) occurs when the populations are able to persist and grow exponentially when dispersal among the populations is present. We provide a mathematical analysis of this phenomenon, in the context of a deterministic model with periodic variation of growth rates and migration. The migration matrix can be reducible, so that the results apply in the case, important for applications, where there is migration in one direction in one season and in the other direction in another season. We also consider dispersal-induced decay (DID), where each population, when isolated, grows exponentially, while populations die out when dispersal between populations is present.</description>

      <title>Metric mean dimension via subshifts of compact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the metric mean dimension of subshifts of compact type. We prove that the metric mean dimensions of a continuous map and its inverse limit coincide, generalizing Bowen's entropy formula. Building upon this result, we extend the notion of metric mean dimension to discontinuous maps in terms of suitable subshifts. As an application, we show that the metric mean dimension of the Gauss map and that of induced maps of the Manneville-Pomeau family is equal to the box dimension of the corresponding set of discontinuity points, which also coincides with a critical parameter of the pressure operator associated to the geometric potential.</description>

      <title>Solution space characterisation of perturbed linear discrete and continuous stochastic Volterra convolution equations: the $\ell^p$ and $L^p$ cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we are concerned with characterising when solutions of perturbed linear stochastic Volterra summation equations are $p$-summable along with when their continuous time counterparts, perturbed linear stochastic Volterra integrodifferential equations are $p$-integrable. In the discrete case we find it necessary and sufficient that perturbing functions are $p$-summable in order to ensure paths of the discrete equation are $p$-summable almost surely, while in the continuous case it transpires one can have almost surely $p$-integrable sample paths even with non-integrable perturbation functions. For the continuous equation the main converse is clinched by considering an appropriate discretisation and applying results from the discrete case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a trichotomy for the orbits of a hypercyclic operator $T$ on a separable Banach space $X$: (1) every vector is mean asymptotic to zero; (2) generic vectors are absolutely mean irregular; (3) every hypercyclic vector is mean divergent to infinity. Examples of weighted backward shifts on $\ell^p$ show that all three cases can happen.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of discrete field theories with guaranteed convergence and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method based on Gaussian process regression to identify discrete variational principles from observed solutions of a field theory. The method is based on the data-based identification of a discrete Lagrangian density. It is a geometric machine learning technique in the sense that the variational structure of the true field theory is reflected in the data-driven model by design. We provide a rigorous convergence statement of the method. The proof circumvents challenges posed by the ambiguity of discrete Lagrangian densities in the inverse problem of variational calculus. Moreover, our method can be used to quantify model uncertainty in the equations of motions and any linear observable of the discrete field theory. This is illustrated on the example of the discrete wave equation and Schr\"odinger equation. The article constitutes an extension of our previous article arXiv:2404.19626 for the data-driven identification of (discrete) Lagrangians for variational dynamics from an ode setting to the setting of discrete pdes.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on discrete topologies: from networks to higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature is a blossoming of regular structures, signature of self-organization of the underlying microscopic interacting agents. Turing theory of pattern formation is one of the most studied mechanisms to address such phenomena and has been applied to a widespread gallery of disciplines. Turing himself used a spatial discretization of the hosting support to eventually deal with a set of ODEs. Such an idea contained the seeds of the theory on discrete support, which has been fully acknowledged with the birth of network science in the early 2000s. This approach allows us to tackle several settings not displaying a trivial continuous embedding, such as multiplex, temporal networks, and, recently, higher-order structures. This line of research has been mostly confined within the network science community, despite its inherent potential to transcend the conventional boundaries of the PDE-based approach to Turing patterns. Moreover, network topology allows for novel dynamics to be generated via a universal formalism that can be readily extended to account for higher-order structures. The interplay between continuous and discrete settings can pave the way for further developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Shocks and instability in Brownian last-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi (SHJ) equations, instability points are the space-time locations where two eternal solutions with the same asymptotic velocity differ. Another crucial structure in such equations is shocks, which are the space-time locations where the velocity field is discontinuous. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the structure and relationships between shocks, instability, and competition interfaces in the Brownian last-passage percolation model, which serves as a prototype of a semi-discrete inviscid stochastic HJ equation in one space dimension. Among our findings, we show that the shock trees of the two unstable eternal solutions differ within the instability region and align outside of it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one can reconstruct a skeleton of the instability region from these two shock trees.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Measure Transport and Neural PDE Solvers for Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of sampling from a probability density can be approached as transporting a tractable density function to the target, known as dynamical measure transport. In this work, we tackle it through a principled unified framework using deterministic or stochastic evolutions described by partial differential equations (PDEs). This framework incorporates prior trajectory-based sampling methods, such as diffusion models or Schr\"odinger bridges, without relying on the concept of time-reversals. Moreover, it allows us to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thus sampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalization constant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional and computational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- and discretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leading to significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared to alternative methods. Moreover, they can readily be fine-tuned with Gauss-Newton methods to achieve high accuracy in sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper appears as the confluence of hyperbolic dynamics, symplectic topology and low dimensional topology, etc. We show that composite symplectic Dehn twists have certain form of nonuniform hyperbolicity: it has positive topological entropy as well as two families of local stable and unstable Lagrangian manifolds, which are analogous to signatures of pseudo Anosov mapping classes. Moreover, we show that the rank of the Floer cohomology group of these compositions grows exponentially under iterations, which partially answers a question of Smith concerning the classification of symplectic mapping class group in higher dimensions. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the positive metric entropy of our model and point out its relationship with the standard map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound for the number of Ruelle resonances for Koopman operators associated to real-analytic Anosov diffeomorphisms: in dimension $d$, the number of resonances larger than $r$ is a $\mathcal{O}(|\log r|^d)$ when $r$ goes to $0$. For each connected component of the space of real-analytic Anosov diffeomorphisms on a real-analytic manifold, we prove a dichotomy: either the exponent $d$ in our bound is never optimal, or it is optimal on a dense subset. Using examples constructed by Bandtlow, Just and Slipantschuk, we see that we are always in the latter situation for connected components of the space of real-analytic Anosov diffeomorphisms on the $2$-dimensional torus.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. For a Zariski dense Anosov subgroup $\Gamma&lt;G$ with respect to a parabolic subgroup $P_\theta$, we prove that any $\Gamma$-Patterson-Sullivan measure charges no mass on any proper subvariety of $G/P_\theta$. More generally, we prove that for a Zariski dense $\theta$-transverse subgroup $\Gamma&lt;G$, any $(\Gamma, \psi)$-Patterson-Sullivan measure charges no mass on any proper subvariety of $G/P_\theta$, provided the $\psi$-Poincar\'e series of $\Gamma$ diverges at $s=1$. In particular, our result also applies to relatively Anosov subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ergodic-theoretic properties of coded shift spaces. A coded shift space is defined as a closure of all bi-infinite concatenations of words from a fixed countable generating set. We derive sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of measures of maximal entropy and equilibrium states of Hoelder continuous potentials based on the partition of the coded shift into its concatenation set (sequences that are concatenations of generating words) and its residual set (sequences added under the closure). In this case we provide a simple explicit description of the measure of maximal entropy. We also obtain flexibility results for the entropy on the concatenation and residual sets. Finally, we prove a local structure theorem for intrinsically ergodic coded shift spaces which shows that our results apply to a larger class of coded shift spaces compared to previous works by Climenhaga, Climenhaga and Thompson, and Pavlov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, M. Tsukamoto (New approach to weighted topological entropy and pressure, Ergod. Theory Dyn. Syst. 43 (2023) 1004-1034) used a new approach to define the weighted topological entropy and pressure. Inspired by his ideas, we introduce the relative weighted topological and entropy for factors and establish several variational principles. One of these results answers a question raised by D. Feng and W. Huang (Variational principle for weighted topological pressure, J. Math. Pures Appl. 106 (2016) 411-452) which positively answers that there is a relative version of the weighted variation principle. Furthermore, we generalize the Ledrappier and Walters' type relative variational principle to the weighted version.</description>

Abstract: We prove ergodicity of a class of infinite measure preserving systems, called skew-products. More precisely, we consider systems of the form \[ {T_f}:{[0, 1) \times \mathbb{R}}\to{[0, 1) \times \mathbb{R}},\quad {T_f(x, t)}:={(T(x), t+f(x))}, \] where $T$ is an interval exchange transformation and $f$ is a piece-wise constant function with a finite number of discontinuities. We show that such system is ergodic with respect to ${Leb}_{[0,1)\times \mathbb{R}}$ for a typical choice of parameters of $T$ and $f$.</description>

      <title>FBI Transform in Gevrey Classes and Anosov Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.03610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytic FBI transform is built on compact manifolds without boundary, that satisfies all the expected properties. It enables the study of microlocal analytic and Gevrey regularity on such manifolds. This tool is then used to study the Ruelle spectrum of Anosov flows with Gevrey coefficients. In particular, finite order for the associated dynamical determinant is proved.</description>

      <title>Geometry of transcendental singularities of complex analytic functions and vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On Riemann surfaces $M$, there exists a canonical correspondence between a possibly multivalued function $\Psi_X$ whose differential is single valued ($i.e.$ an additively automorphic singular complex analytic function) and a vector field $X$. From the point of view of vector fields, the singularities that we consider are zeros, poles, isolated essential singularities and accumulation points of the above. The theory of singularities of the inverse function $\Psi_X^{-1}$ is extended from meromorphic functions to additively automorphic singular complex analytic functions. The main contribution is a complete characterization of when a singularity of $\Psi_X^{-1}$ is either algebraic, logarithmic or arises from a zero with nonzero residue of $X$. Relationships between analytical properties of $\Psi_X$, singularities of $\Psi_X^{-1}$ and singularities of $X$ are presented. Families and sporadic examples showing the geometrical richness of vector fields on the neighbourhoods of the singularities of $\Psi_X^{-1}$ are studied. As applications we have; a description of the maximal univalence regions for complex trajectory solutions of a vector field $X$, a geometric characterization of the incomplete real trajectories of a vector field $X$, and a description of the singularities of the vector field associated to the Riemann $\xi$ function.</description>

      <title>The Maslov index, degenerate crossings and the stability of pulse solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the scalar Swift-Hohenberg equation with quadratic-cubic nonlinearity, it is known that symmetric pulse solutions exist for certain parameter regions. In this paper we develop a method to determine the spectral stability of these solutions. We first associate a Maslov index to each solution and then argue that this index coincides with the number of unstable eigenvalues for the linearized evolution equation. This requires extending the method of computing the Maslov index introduced by Robbin and Salamon to so-called degenerate crossings. We extend their formulation of the Maslov index to degenerate crossings of general order. Furthermore, we develop a numerical method to compute the Maslov index associated to symmetric pulse solutions. Finally, we consider several solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation and use our method to characterize their stability.</description>
