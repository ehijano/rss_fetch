      <title>A machine learning approach to predict near-optimal meshes for turbulent compressible flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a methodology to predict a near-optimal spacing function, which defines the element sizes, suitable to perform steady RANS turbulent viscous flow simulations. The strategy aims at utilising existing high fidelity simulations to compute a target spacing function and train an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the spacing function for new simulations, either unseen operating conditions or unseen geometric configurations. Several challenges induced by the use of highly stretched elements are addressed. The final goal is to substantially reduce the time and human expertise that is nowadays required to produce suitable meshes for simulations. Numerical examples involving turbulent compressible flows in two dimensions are used to demonstrate the ability of the trained ANN to predict a suitable spacing function. The influence of the NN architecture and the size of the training dataset are discussed. Finally, the suitability of the predicted meshes to perform simulations is investigated.</description>

      <title>Constructing Boundary-identical Microstructures by Guided Diffusion for Fast Multiscale Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to construct large-scale boundary-identical microstructure datasets with high attribute coverage for highly efficient multiscale design. Central to our technique is using a deep generative model to generate microstructures under the two conditions, including the specified boundary and homogenized elastic tensor. We achieve the desired dataset by alternately adding microstructures with diverse attributes constructed by the deep generative model into the dataset and retraining the deep generative model. Sixteen compatible metamaterial datasets with high attribute coverage are constructed by our method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the obtained datasets over various multiscale design examples. Specifically, in the design of a mechanical cloak, we utilize macrostructures with $30 \times 30$ elements and microstructures filled with $256 \times 256$ elements. The entire reverse design process is completed within one minute, significantly enhancing the efficiency of the multiscale optimization.</description>

      <title>Convolutional neural network based reduced order modeling for multiscale problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with reduced order modeling (ROM) for efficient simulations of multiscale problems. These problems are modeled by partial differential equations with high-dimensional random inputs. The proposed method involves two separate CNNs: Basis CNNs and Coefficient CNNs (Coef CNNs), which correspond to two main parts of ROM. The method is called CNN-based ROM. The former one learns input-specific basis functions from the snapshots of fine-scale solutions. An activation function, inspired by Galerkin projection, is utilized at the output layer to reconstruct fine-scale solutions from the basis functions. Numerical results show that the basis functions learned by the Basis CNNs resemble data, which help to significantly reduce the number of the basis functions. Moreover, CNN-based ROM is less sensitive to data fluctuation caused by numerical errors than traditional ROM. Since the tests of Basis CNNs still need fine-scale stiffness matrix and load vector, it can not be directly applied to nonlinear problems. The Coef CNNs can be applied to nonlinear problems and designed to determine the coefficients for linear combination of basis functions. In addition, two applications of CNN-based ROM are presented, including predicting MsFEM basis functions within oversampling regions and building accurate surrogates for inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A locking-free isogeometric thin shell formulation based on higher order accurate local strain projection via approximate dual splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel isogeometric discretization approach for the Kirchhoff-Love shell formulation based on the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle. For mitigating membrane locking, we discretize the independent strains with spline basis functions that are one degree lower than those used for the displacements. To enable computationally efficient condensation of the independent strains, we first discretize the variations of the independent strains with approximate dual splines to obtain a projection matrix that is close to a diagonal matrix. We then diagonalize this strain projection matrix via row-sum lumping. The combination of approximate dual test functions with row-sum lumping enables the direct condensation of the independent strain fields at the quadrature point level, while maintaining higher-order accuracy at optimal rates of convergence. We illustrate the numerical properties and the performance of our approach through numerical benchmarks, including a curved Euler-Bernoulli beam and the examples of the shell obstacle course.</description>

      <title>Generalized and high-efficiency arbitrary-positioned buffer for smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an arbitrary-positioned buffer for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, whose generality and high efficiency are achieved through two techniques. First, with the local coordinate system established at each arbitrary-positioned in-/outlet, particle positions in the global coordinate system are transformed into those in it via coordinate transformation. Since one local axis is located perpendicular to the in-/outlet boundary, the position comparison between particles and the threshold line or surface can be simplified to just this coordinate dimension. Second, particle candidates subjected to position comparison at one specific in-/outlet are restricted to those within the local cell-linked lists nearby the defined buffer zone, which significantly enhances computational efficiency due to a small portion of particles being checked. With this developed buffer, particle generation and deletion at arbitrary-positioned in- and outlets of complex flows can be handled efficiently and straightforwardly. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of the developed buffer through 2-D and 3-D non-/orthogonal uni-/bidirectional flows with arbitrary-positioned in- and outlets, driven by either pressure or velocity boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Contextual Market Equilibrium Computation through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with a relatively small number of buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to estimate the loss function of the training algorithm unbiasedly, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient descent. To evaluate the approximated solution, we introduce a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Multistep Criticality Search and Power Shaping in Microreactors with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing operation and maintenance costs is a key objective for advanced reactors in general and microreactors in particular. To achieve this reduction, developing robust autonomous control algorithms is essential to ensure safe and autonomous reactor operation. Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, specifically reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, have seen rapid increased application to control problems, such as plasma control in fusion tokamaks and building energy management. In this work, we introduce the use of RL for intelligent control in nuclear microreactors. The RL agent is trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) and advantage actor-critic (A2C), cutting-edge deep RL techniques, based on a high-fidelity simulation of a microreactor design inspired by the Westinghouse eVinci\textsuperscript{TM} design. We utilized a Serpent model to generate data on drum positions, core criticality, and core power distribution for training a feedforward neural network surrogate model. This surrogate model was then used to guide a PPO and A2C control policies in determining the optimal drum position across various reactor burnup states, ensuring critical core conditions and symmetrical power distribution across all six core portions. The results demonstrate the excellent performance of PPO in identifying optimal drum positions, achieving a hextant power tilt ratio of approximately 1.002 (within the limit of $&lt;$ 1.02) and maintaining criticality within a 10 pcm range. A2C did not provide as competitive of a performance as PPO in terms of performance metrics for all burnup steps considered in the cycle. Additionally, the results highlight the capability of well-trained RL control policies to quickly identify control actions, suggesting a promising approach for enabling real-time autonomous control through digital twins.</description>

      <title>A Nonoverlapping Domain Decomposition Method for Extreme Learning Machines: Elliptic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a methodology for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. It presets the weight/bias coefficients in the hidden layer with random values, which remain fixed throughout the computation, and uses a linear least squares method for training the parameters of the output layer of the neural network. It is known to be much faster than Physics informed neural networks. However, classical ELM is still computationally expensive when a high level of representation is desired in the solution as this requires solving a large least squares system. In this paper, we propose a nonoverlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) for ELMs that not only reduces the training time of ELMs, but is also suitable for parallel computation. In numerical analysis, DDMs have been widely studied to reduce the time to obtain finite element solutions for elliptic PDEs through parallel computation. Among these approaches, nonoverlapping DDMs are attracting the most attention. Motivated by these methods, we introduce local neural networks, which are valid only at corresponding subdomains, and an auxiliary variable at the interface. We construct a system on the variable and the parameters of local neural networks. A Schur complement system on the interface can be derived by eliminating the parameters of the output layer. The auxiliary variable is then directly obtained by solving the reduced system after which the parameters for each local neural network are solved in parallel. A method for initializing the hidden layer parameters suitable for high approximation quality in large systems is also proposed. Numerical results that verify the acceleration performance of the proposed method with respect to the number of subdomains are presented.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Global Carbon Inequality Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: International trading networks significantly influence global economic conditions and environmental outcomes. A notable imbalance between economic gains and emissions transfers persists, manifesting as carbon inequality. This study introduces a novel metric, the Ecological Economic Equality Index, integrated with complex network dynamics analysis, to quantitatively evaluate the evolving roles within the global trading network and to pinpoint inequities in trade relationships from 1995 to 2022. Utilising high spatiotemporal resolution data from the Environmentally Extended Multi-regional Input-output model, our findings reveal a widening disparity in carbon inequality and dynamic patterns. This analysis emphasises the gap in regional carbon inequality and identifies unequal trade. The study underscores that carbon inequality is a critical challenge affecting both developing and developed regions, demanding widespread attention and action.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Movement and Naive Predictions for Point Forecasting in Univariate Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional methods for point forecasting in univariate random walks often fail to surpass naive benchmarks due to data unpredictability. This study introduces a novel forecasting method that fuses movement prediction (binary classification) with naive forecasts for accurate one-step-ahead point forecasting. The method's efficacy is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulations, and real-world data experiments. It reliably exceeds naive forecasts with movement prediction accuracies as low as 0.55, outperforming baseline models like ARIMA, linear regression, MLP, and LSTM networks in forecasting the S\&amp;P 500 index and Bitcoin prices. This method is particularly advantageous when accurate point predictions are challenging but accurate movement predictions are attainable, translating movement predictions into point forecasts in random walk contexts.</description>

      <title>WISER: multimodal variational inference for full-waveform inversion without dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-amortized variational inference framework designed for computationally feasible uncertainty quantification in 2D full-waveform inversion to explore the multimodal posterior distribution without dimensionality reduction. The framework is called WISER, short for full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions with Refinements. WISER leverages the power of generative artificial intelligence to perform approximate amortized inference that is low-cost albeit showing an amortization gap. This gap is closed through non-amortized refinements that make frugal use of acoustic wave physics. Case studies illustrate that WISER is capable of full-resolution, computationally feasible, and reliable uncertainty estimates of velocity models and imaged reflectivities.</description>

      <title>Tempora-Fusion: Time-Lock Puzzle with Efficient Verifiable Homomorphic Linear Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To securely transmit sensitive information into the future, Time-Lock Puzzles (TLPs) have been developed. Their applications include scheduled payments, timed commitments, e-voting, and sealed-bid auctions. Homomorphic TLP is a key variant of TLP that enables computation on puzzles from different clients. This allows a solver/server to tackle only a single puzzle encoding the computation's result. However, existing homomorphic TLPs lack support for verifying the correctness of the computation results. We address this limitation by introducing Tempora-Fusion, a TLP that allows a server to perform homomorphic linear combinations of puzzles from different clients while ensuring verification of computation correctness. This scheme avoids asymmetric-key cryptography for verification, thus paving the way for efficient implementations. We discuss our scheme's application in various domains, such as federated learning, scheduled payments in online banking, and e-voting.</description>
