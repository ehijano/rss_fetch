      <title>A Framework to Formulate Pathfinding Problems for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the applications of quantum computing becoming more and more widespread, finding ways that allow end users without experience in the field to apply quantum computers to solve their individual problems is becoming a crucial task. However, current optimization algorithms require problem instances to be posed in complex formats that are challenging to formulate, even for experts. In particular, the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formalism employed by many quantum optimization algorithms, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), involves the mathematical rewriting of constraints under strict conditions. To facilitate this process, we propose a framework to automatically generate QUBO formulations for pathfinding problems. This framework allows users to translate their specific problem instances into formulations that can be passed directly to quantum algorithms for optimization without requiring any expertise in the field of quantum computing. It supports three different encoding schemes that can easily be compared without requiring manual reformulation efforts. The resulting QUBO formulations are robust and efficient, reducing the previously tedious and error-prone reformulation process to a task that can be completed in a matter of seconds. In addition to an open-source Python package available on https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qubomaker, we also provide a graphical user interface accessible through the web (https://cda-tum.github.io/mqt-qubomaker/), which can be used to operate the framework without requiring the end user to write any code.</description>

      <title>Extensive Long-Range Entanglement at Finite Temperatures from a Nonequilibrium Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal equilibrium states of local quantum many-body systems are notorious for their spatially decaying correlations, which place severe restrictions on the types of many-body entanglement structures that may be observed at finite temperatures. These restrictions may however be defied when an out-of-equilibrium steady state is considered instead. In this paper, we study the entanglement properties of free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice that contains a generic charge- and energy-conserving noninteracting impurity, and that is connected at its edges to two reservoirs with different equilibrium energy distributions. These distributions may differ in either temperature, chemical potential, or both, thereby inducing an external bias. We analytically derive exact asymptotic expressions for several quantum information measures -- the mutual information, its R\'enyi generalizations, and the fermionic negativity -- that quantify the correlation and entanglement between two subsystems located on opposite sides of the impurity. We show that all these measures scale (to a leading order) linearly with the overlap between one subsystem and the mirror image of the other (upon reflection of the latter about the impurity), independently of the distance between the subsystems. While a simple proportionality relation between the negativity and R\'enyi versions of the mutual information is observed to hold at zero temperature, it breaks down at finite temperatures, suggesting that these quantities represent strong long-range correlations of different origins. Our results generalize previous findings that were limited to the case of a chemical-potential bias at zero temperature, rigorously demonstrating that the effect of long-range volume-law entanglement is robust at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic measurements and models of energy deposition in the substrate of quantum circuits by natural ionizing radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturally occurring background radiation is a source of correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits that will challenge error-correction schemes. To characterize the radiation environment in an unshielded laboratory, we performed broadband, spectroscopic measurements of background events in silicon substrates located inside a millikelvin refrigerator, an environment representative of superconducting qubit systems. We measured the background spectra in silicon substrates of two thicknesses, 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm, and obtained the average event rate and the integrated power deposition. In a 25 mm^2 area and the thinner substrate, these values are 0.023 events per second and 4.9 keV/s, counting events that deposit at least 40 keV. We find the background spectrum to be nearly featureless. Its intensity decreases by a factor of 40,000 between 100 keV and 3 MeV for silicon substrates 0.5 mm thick. We find the cryogenic measurements to be in good agreement with predictions based on measurements of the terrestrial gamma-ray flux, published models of cosmic-ray fluxes, a crude model of the cryostat, and radiation-transport simulations. No free parameters are required to predict the background spectra in the silicon substrates. The good agreement between measurements and predictions allow assessment of the relative contributions of terrestrial and cosmic background sources and their dependence on substrate thickness. Our spectroscopic measurements are performed with superconducting microresonators that transduce deposited energy to a readily detectable electrical signal. We find that gamma-ray emissions from radioisotopes are responsible for the majority of events depositing E&lt;1.5 MeV, while nucleons among the cosmic-ray secondary particles cause most events that deposit more energy. These results suggest several paths to reducing the impact of background radiation on quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>A class of Schwarz qubit maps with diagonal unitary and orthogonal symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of unital qubit maps displaying diagonal unitary and orthogonal symmetries is analyzed. Such maps already found a lot applications in quantum information theory. We provide a complete characterization of this class of maps showing intricate relation between positivity, operator Schwarz inequality, and complete positivity. Finally, it is shown how to generalize the entire picture beyond unital case (so called generalized Schwarz maps). Interestingly, the first example of Schwarz but not completely positive map found by Choi belongs to our class. As a case study we provide a full characterization of Pauli maps. Our analysis leads to generalization of seminal Fujiwara-Algoet conditions for Pauli quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Discovering Factorization Surface of Quantum Spin Chains with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is required for a variety of quantum information tasks, making it crucial to identify the parameter space in which the ground state is fully separable, known as the factorization surface (FS). Nonetheless, the tuning parameters indicating FS for several quantum spin models remain unknown. We employ symbolic regression (SR), a supervised learning technique, to determine a closed-form expression in the parameter regime corresponding to FS of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. We verify the effectiveness of this method by examining the analytically tractable models, namely a nearest-neighbor (NN) quantum transverse XY model with additional Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Aharony interactions, for which the FS is well-known. We construct an accurate expression for the FS of the XYZ model by providing the parameter set through the SR algorithm in which the ground state is derived by matrix product state formalism. With a satisfactory level of accuracy, we estimate the FS for the long-range XY model, and the NN XY model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type asymmetric interaction for which the factorization surface is not known.</description>

      <title>Constructing $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathord{\#}\mathrm P}$-complete problems and ${\mathord{\#}\mathrm P}$-hardness of circuit extraction in phase-free ZH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ZH calculus is a graphical language for quantum computation reasoning. The phase-free variant offers a simple set of generators that guarantee universality. ZH calculus is effective in MBQC and analysis of quantum circuits constructed with the universal gate set Toffoli+H. While circuits naturally translate to ZH diagrams, finding an ancilla-free circuit equivalent to a given diagram is hard. Here, we show that circuit extraction for phase-free ZH calculus is ${\mathord{\#}\mathrm P}$-hard, extending the existing result for ZX calculus. Another problem believed to be hard is comparing whether two diagrams represent the same process. We show that two closely related problems are $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathord{\#}\mathrm P}$-complete. The first problem is: given two processes represented as diagrams, determine the existence of a computational basis state on which they equalize. The second problem is checking whether the matrix representation of a given diagram contains an entry equal to a given number. Our proof adapts the proof of Cook-Levin theorem to a reduction from a non-deterministic Turing Machine with access to ${\mathord{\#}\mathrm P}$ oracle.</description>

      <title>Quantum delocalization on correlation landscape: The key to exponentially fast multipartite entanglement generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement, a hallmark of quantum mechanics, is a vital resource for quantum technologies. Generating highly entangled multipartite states is a key goal in current quantum experiments. We unveil a novel framework for understanding entanglement generation dynamics in Hamiltonian systems by quantum delocalization of an effective operator wavefunction on a correlation landscape. Our framework establishes a profound connection between the exponentially fast generation of multipartite entanglement, witnessed by the quantum Fisher information, and the linearly increasing asymptotics of hopping amplitudes governing the delocalization dynamics in Krylov space. We illustrate this connection using the paradigmatic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and highlight potential signatures in chaotic Feingold-Peres tops. Our results provide a transformative tool for understanding and harnessing rapid entanglement production in complex quantum systems, providing a pathway for quantum enhanced technologies by large-scale entanglement.</description>

      <title>Remote Cross-resonance Gate between Superconducting Fixed-frequency Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum state transfer and remote entanglement between superconducting fixed-frequency qubits have not yet been realized. In this study, we propose an alternative remote cross-resonance gate. Considering multiple modes of a superconducting coaxial cable connecting qubits, we must find conditions under which the cross-resonance gate operates with a certain accuracy even in the presence of qubit frequency shifts due to manufacturing errors. For 0.25- and 0.5-m cables, remote cross-resonance gates with a concurrence of $&gt;99.9\%$ in entanglement generation are obtained even with $\pm$10-MHz frequency shifts. For a 1-m cable with a narrow mode spacing, a concurrence of 99.5\% is achieved by reducing the coupling between the qubits and cable. The optimized echoed raised-cosine pulse duration is 150--400 ns, which is similar to the operation time of cross-resonance gates between neighboring qubits on a chip. The dissipation through the cable modes does not considerably affect the obtained results. Such high-precision quantum interconnects pave the way not only for scaling up quantum computer systems but also for nonlocal connections on a chip.</description>

      <title>Quantum plasmonic sensing by Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum plasmonic sensor using Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry that measures the refractive index of an analyte, embedded in a plasmonic beam splitter composed of a dual-Kretschmann configuration, which serves as a frustrated total internal reflection beamsplitter. The sensing performance of the HOM interferometry, combined with single-photon detectors, is evaluated through Fisher information for estimation of the refractive index of the analyte. This is subsequently compared with the classical benchmark that considers the injection of a coherent state of light into the plasmonic beamsplitter. By varying the wavelength of the single photons and the refractive index of the analyte, we identify a wide range where a 50 % quantum enhancement is achieved and discuss the observed behaviors in comparison with the classical benchmark. We expect this study to provide a useful insight into the advancement of quantum-enhanced sensing technologies, with direct implications for a wide range of nanophotonic beamsplitter structures.</description>

      <title>PT Symmetry, induced mechanical lasing and tunable force sensing in a coupled-mode optically levitated nanoparticle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate PT symmetry, induced mechanical lasing and force sensing in an optically levitated nanoparticle with coupled oscillation modes. The coupling in the levitated system is created by the modulation of an asymmetric optical potential in the plane transverse to the beam trapping the nanoparticle. We show that such a coupling can lead to PT-symmetric mechanical behavior for experimentally realistic parameters. Further, by examining the phonon dynamics and the second-order coherence of the nanoparticle modes, we determine that induced mechanical lasing is also possible. Finally, we demonstrate that tunable ultra-sensitive force sensing can be engineered in the system. Our studies represent an advance in the fields of coherent manipulation of coupled degrees of freedom of levitated mechanical oscillators and their application for sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) has attracted widespread attention due to its ability to carry information in multiple dimensions. However, a high-dimensional entanglement carrying OAM can be affected by environment and undergoes decoherence. Ensuring the stability and high fidelity of entangled states after transmission is a crucial part of quantum communication. How to control the entangled states are essential. In this paper, we produce the polarization entangled photon pairs by type I BBO crystals by means of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), we achieve the polarization-OAM hybrid entangled states by q-plate (QP) by means of manipulating the multi-degrees of freedom of the quantum state after passing through the APD communication channel. The polarization entangled photon pairs have the characteristics of OAM. We use polarization degree of freedom to modulate OAM degree of freedom, our polarization-OAM hybrid entangled states can slow down the reduction of the fidelity in the during of transmission process. Our quantum states exhibit a superior level of fidelity contrast with the conventional situation. This method will provide a theoretical guidance for improving the transmission fidelity of OAM states in fiber.</description>

      <title>Accuracy guarantees and quantum advantage in analogue open quantum simulation with and without noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body open quantum systems, described by Lindbladian master equations, are a rich class of physical models that display complex equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium phenomena which remain to be understood. In this paper, we theoretically analyze noisy analogue quantum simulation of geometrically local open quantum systems and provide evidence that this problem is both hard to simulate on classical computers and could be approximately solved on near-term quantum devices. First, given a noiseless quantum simulator, we show that the dynamics of local observables and the fixed-point expectation values of rapidly-mixing local observables in geometrically local Lindbladians can be obtained to a precision of $\varepsilon$ in time that is $\text{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ and uniform in system size. Furthermore, we establish that the quantum simulator would provide an exponential advantage, in run-time scaling with respect to the target precision and either the evolution time (when simulating dynamics) or the Lindbladian's decay rate (when simulating fixed-points) over any classical algorithm for these problems unless BQP = BPP. We then consider the presence of noise in the quantum simulator in the form of additional geometrically-local Linbdladian terms. We show that the simulation tasks considered in this paper are stable to errors, i.e. they can be solved to a noise-limited, but system-size independent, precision. Finally, we establish that there are stable geometrically local Lindbladian simulation problems such that as the noise rate on the simulator is reduced, classical algorithms must take time exponentially longer in the inverse noise rate to attain the same precision unless BQP = BPP.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Approach for Non-Markovian Dissipative Dynamics of Many-Body Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems coupled to non-Markovian environments remains an outstanding challenge due to exponentially scaling computational costs. We present an artificial intelligence strategy to overcome this obstacle by integrating the neural quantum states approach into the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). Our approach utilizes restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to compactly represent the reduced density tensor, explicitly encoding the combined effects of system-environment correlations and nonMarkovian memory. Applied to model systems exhibiting prominent effects of system-environment correlation and non-Markovian memory, our approach achieves comparable accuracy to conventional hierarchical equations of motion, while requiring significantly fewer dynamical variables. The novel RBM-based DQME-SQ approach paves the way for investigating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in previously intractable regimes, with implications spanning various frontiers of modern science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum distillation is a modern technology to decrease the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem by coherent system dynamics. Here we propose an active quantum distillation protocol, in which a bang-bang theme is applied to actively control the coherent dynamics of our system in order to obtain a subsystem with the von Neumann entropy as low as possible. For a bipartite Bosonic system, we derive the analytical expression of lower bound of the entropy of subsystem under any unitary transformation with conservation of particles. The lower bound is validated by numerical simulations on the Bose-Hubbard model, where the coherent evolution is controlled by tuning one interaction term of the Hamiltonian. Our protocol can be used to decrease the entropy of one subsystem lower than the total bipartite state and increase the number of Bosons or only distill out very few Bosons in the subsystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow quantum circuits feature not only computational advantage over their classical counterparts but also cutting-edge applications. Storing quantum information generated by shallow circuits is a fundamental question of both theoretical and practical importance that remained largely unexplored. In this work, we show that $N$ copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state generated by a fixed-depth circuit can be compressed into a hybrid memory of $O(n \log_2 N)$ (qu)bits, which achieves the optimal scaling of memory cost. Our work shows that the computational complexity of resources can significantly impact the rate of quantum information processing, offering a unique and unified view of quantum Shannon theory and quantum computing in the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: Indistinguishability of single photons from independent sources is critically important for scalable quantum technologies. We provide a comprehensive comparison of single-photon indistinguishability of different kinds of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) systems by numerically simulating Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) two-photon interference. We find that the CQED system using nature atoms exhibit superiority in indistinguishability, benefiting from the inherently identical features. Moreover, a $\Lambda-$type three-level atoms show essential robust against variation of various system parameters because it exploits the two ground states with considerable smaller decay rates for single-photon generation. Furthermore, a machine learning-based framework is proposed to significantly and robustly improve single-photon indistinguishability for non-identical two CQED systems. This work may pave the way for designing and engineering reliable and scalable photon-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Parameterized Quantum Circuit Optimization (BPQCO): A task and hardware-dependent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) have emerged as a promising quantum alternative for solving optimization and machine learning problems using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). The design of these circuits influences the ability of the algorithm to efficiently explore the solution space and converge to more optimal solutions. Choosing an appropriate circuit topology, gate set, and parameterization scheme is determinant to achieve good performance. In addition, it is not only problem-dependent, but the quantum hardware used also has a significant impact on the results. Therefore, we present BPQCO, a Bayesian Optimization-based strategy to search for optimal PQCs adapted to the problem to be solved and to the characteristics and limitations of the chosen quantum hardware. To this end, we experimentally demonstrate the influence of the circuit design on the performance obtained for two classification problems (a synthetic dataset and the well-known Iris dataset), focusing on the design of the circuit ansatz. In addition, we study the degradation of the obtained circuits in the presence of noise when simulating real quantum computers. To mitigate the effect of noise, two alternative optimization strategies based on the characteristics of the quantum system are proposed. The results obtained confirm the relevance of the presented approach and allow its adoption in further work based on the use of PQCs.</description>

Abstract: We determine the form of the unitary transformation that diagonalizes the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. This leads to operators the action of which has a simple interpretation in terms of the dressed states, the energy eigenstates. This suggests a set of coherent states and spin coherent states based on the dressed states.</description>

      <title>Robust and composable device-independent quantum protocols for oblivious transfer and bit commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present robust and composable device-independent quantum protocols for oblivious transfer (OT) and bit commitment (BC) using Magic Square devices. We assume there is no long-term quantum memory, that is, after a finite time interval, referred to as \textbf{DELAY}, the states stored in the devices decohere. By robustness, which is a highlight of our protocols, we mean that the protocols are correct and secure even when devices are slightly off from their ideal specifications (the \emph{faulty but non-malicious} regime). This is an important property, since in the real world, devices would certainly have small manufacturing errors and cannot be expected to be ideal. To the best of our understanding and knowledge, none of the known DI protocols for OT and BC in the literature are robust; they can not guarantee correctness in the faulty but non-malicious regime. Our protocols are sequentially composable and hence, can be used as building blocks to construct larger protocols, while still preserving security guarantees.</description>

      <title>Existential Unforgeability in Quantum Authentication From Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Random von Neumann Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are hardware devices with the assumption of possessing inherent non-clonable physical randomness which leads to unique pairs of inputs and outputs that provide a secure fingerprint for cryptographic protocols like authentication. In the case of quantum PUFs (QPUFs), the input-output pairs consist of quantum states instead of classical bitstrings, offering advantages over classical PUFs (CPUFs) such as challenge reusability via public channels and non-reliance over any trusted party due to the no-cloning theorem. In recent literature, a generalized mathematical framework for studying QPUFs was developed, which paved the way for having QPUF models with provable security. It was proved that \emph{existential unforgeability} against Quantum Polynomial Time (QPT) adversaries cannot be achieved by any random unitary QPUF. Since measurements are non-unitary quantum processes, we define a QPUF based on random von Neumann measurements. We prove that such a QPUF is existentially unforgeable. Thus, we introduce the first model in existing literature that depicts such a high level of provable security. We also prove that the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) protocol applied on a Haar random unitary serves as an approximate implementation for this kind of QPUF as it approximates a von Neumann measurement on the eigenbasis of the unitary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For harnessing the full potential of quantum phenomena, light-matter interfaces and complexly connected quantum networks are required, relying on the joint quantum operation of different physical platforms. In this work, we analyze the quantum properties of multipartite quantum systems, consisting of an arbitrarily large collection of optical cavities with two-level atoms. In particular, we explore quantum walks in such systems and determine the resulting entanglement. Realistic imperfections are included in the model as optical losses and spontaneous decays of atoms. The topology of torus and the non-orientable M\"obius strip serve as examples of complex networks we consider, demonstrating the versatility of our approach and resulting in interesting quantum dynamics and interference effects for quantum simulation applications.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant quantum computing with the parity code and noise-biased qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fault-tolerant universal quantum computing architecture based on a code concatenation of noise-biased qubits and the parity architecture. The parity architecture can be understood as a LDPC code tailored specifically to obtain any desired logical connectivity from nearest neighbor physical interactions. The code layout can be dynamically adjusted to algorithmic requirements on-the-fly. This allows reaching arbitrary code distances and thereby exponential suppression of errors with a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. In addition to the previously explored tool-sets for concatenated cat codes, our approach features parallelizable interactions between arbitrary sets of qubits by directly addressing the parity qubits in the code. The proposed scheme enables codes with less physical qubit overhead compared to the repetition code with the same code distances, while requiring only weight-3 and weight-4 stabilizers and nearest neighbor 2D square-lattice connectivity.</description>

      <title>Open-system eigenstate thermalization in a noninteracting integrable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermalization in isolated quantum systems from an open quantum systems perspective. We argue that for a small system connected to a macroscopic bath, the system observables are thermal if the combined system-bath configuration is in an eigenstate of its Hamiltonian, even for fully integrable models (unless thermalization is suppressed by localization due to strong coupling). We illustrate our claim for a single fermionic level coupled to a noninteracting fermionic bath. We further show that upon quenching the system Hamiltonian, the system occupancy relaxes to the thermal value corresponding to the new Hamiltonian. Finally, we demonstrate that system thermalization also arises for a system coupled to a bath initialized in a typical eigenstate of its Hamiltonian. Our findings show that chaos and nonintegrability are not the sole drivers of thermalization and complementary approaches are needed to offer a more comprehensive understanding of how statistical mechanics emerges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the simplest atom in nature, the hydrogen atom has been explored thoroughly from the perspective of non-relativistic quantum mechanics to relativistic quantum mechanics. Among the research on hydrogen atom, its energy level is the most basic, which can be obtained more conveniently predicated on the $SO(4)$ symmetry than the wave-equation resolution. Moreover, ``spin'' is another indispensable topic in quantum mechanics, appearing as an intrinsic degree of freedom. In this work, we generalize the quantum Runge-Lenz vector to a spin-dependent one, and then extract a novel Hamiltonian of hydrogen atom with spin based on the requirement of $SO(4)$ symmetry. Furthermore, the energy spectrum of hydrogen atom with spin potentials is also determined by the remarkable approach of $SO(4)$ symmetry. Our findings extend the ground of hydrogen atom, and may contribute to other complicated models based on hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Solving Power Grid Optimization Problems with Rydberg Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of neutral atom quantum hardware provides a unique opportunity to design hardware-centered algorithms for solving real-world problems aimed at establishing quantum utility. In this work, we study the performance of two such algorithms on solving MaxCut problem for various weighted graphs. The first method uses a state-of-the-art machine learning tool to optimize the pulse shape and embedding of the graph using an adiabatic Ansatz to find the ground state. We tested the performance of this method on finding maximum power section task of the IEEE 9-bus power system and obtaining MaxCut of randomly generated problems of size up to 12 on the Aquila quantum processor. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first MaxCut results on Quera's Aquila quantum hardware. Our experiments run on Aquila demonstrate that even though the probability of obtaining the solution is reduced, one can still solve the MaxCut problem on cloud-accessed neutral atom quantum hardware. The second method uses local detuning, which is an emergent update on the Aquila hardware, to obtain a near exact realization of the standard QAOA Ansatz with similar performance. Finally, we study the fidelity throughout the time evolution realized in the adiabatic method as a benchmark for the IEEE 9-bus power grid graph state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. We devise an analytical bound to the average fidelity between the desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. We demonstrate that fidelity decays exponentially with both the number of qubits and circuit depth, and determine the decay rates as a function of the parameterized probabilities of the two types of errors. These decay constants are intricately linked to the connectivity and dimensionality of the processor's architecture. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting fidelity trends in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

Abstract: For open quantum systems,a short-time evolution is usually well described by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,while long-time dynamics requires the Lindblad master equation,in which the Liouvillian superoperators characterize the time evolution.In this paper, we constructed an open system by adding suitable gain and loss operators to the Chen insulator to investigate the time evolution of quantum states at long times by numerical simulations.Finally,we also propose a topolectrical circuits to realize the dissipative system for experimental observation.It is found that the opening and closing of the Liouvillian gap leads to different damping behaviours of the system and that the presence of non-Hermitian skin effects leads to a phenomenon of chiral damping with sharp wavefronts.Our study deepens the understanding of quantum dynamics of dissipative system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational methods are highly valuable computational tools for solving high-dimensional quantum systems. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of three variational methods: the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), Boltzmann machine learning, and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We apply these methods to two different quantum systems: the fermi-Hubbard model in condensed matter physics and the Schwinger model in high energy physics. To facilitate the computations on quantum computers, we map each model to a spin 1/2 system using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. This transformation allows us to take advantage of the capabilities of quantum computing. We calculate the ground state of both quantum systems and compare the results obtained using the three variational methods. By doing so, we aim to demonstrate the power and effectiveness of these variational approaches in tackling complex quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mixing of open quantum systems is a fundamental problem in physics and quantum information science. Existing approaches for estimating the mixing time often rely on the spectral gap estimation of the Lindbladian generator, which can be challenging to obtain in practice. We propose a novel theoretical framework to estimate the mixing time of open quantum systems that treats the Hamiltonian and dissipative part separately, thus circumventing the need for a priori estimation of the spectral gap of the full Lindbladian generator. The technique is based on the construction of an energy functional inspired by the hypocoercivity of (classical) kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for partially distinguishable bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum central limit theorem derived by Cushen and Hudson provides the foundations for understanding how subsystems of large bosonic systems evolving unitarily do reach equilibrium. It finds important applications in the context of quantum interferometry, for example, with photons. A practical feature of current photonic experiments, however, is that photons carry their own internal degrees of freedom pertaining to, e.g., the polarization or spatiotemporal mode they occupy, which makes them partially distinguishable. The ensuing deviation from ideal indistinguishability is well known to have observable consequences, for example in relation with boson bunching, but an understanding of its role in bosonic equilibration phenomena is still missing. Here, we generalize the Cushen-Hudson quantum central limit theorem to encompass scenarios with partial distinguishability, implying an asymptotic convergence of the subsystem's reduced state towards a multimode Gaussian state defined over the internal degrees of freedom. While these asymptotic internal states may not be directly accessible, we show that particle number distributions carry important signatures of distinguishability, which may be used to diagnose experimental imperfections in large boson sampling experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple model and propose a scheme that allows the production of twisted atoms in free space using the absorption of twisted photons by a bound electron. We show that in the inelastic collision of a photon and an atom, the twisted state of the photon is transferred to the center-of-mass state, so that the projection of the orbital momentum of the atom becomes $m_\gamma-\Delta m_e$. We also show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the twistedness of the photon is either transferred to the atomic center-of-mass quantum state or modifies the selection rule for the bound electron transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of the energetic efficiency of quantum computers has gained some attention only recently. A precise understanding of the resources required to operate a quantum computer with a targeted computational performance and how the energy requirements can impact the scalability is still missing. In this work, one implementation of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) algorithm in a trapped ion setup was studied. The main focus was to obtain a theoretical characterization of the energetic costs of quantum computation. The energetic cost of the experiment was estimated by analyzing the components of the setup and the steps involved in a quantum computation, from the cooling and preparation of the ions to the implementation of the algorithm and readout of the result. A potential scaling of the energetic costs was argued and used to find a possible threshold for an energetic quantum advantage against state-of-the-art classical supercomputers.</description>

      <title>Testing Link Fidelity in a Quantum Network using Operational Form of Trace Distance with Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state comparison, utilizing metrics like fidelity and trace distance, underpins the assessment of quantum networks within quantum information theory. While recent research has expanded theoretical understanding, incorporating error analysis and scalability considerations remains crucial for practical applications. The primary contribution of this letter is to address these gaps by deriving the novel operational trace distance for multi-node networks, establishing a trace distance vs. fidelity benchmark incorporating error bounds, and bridging quantum operations with tensor network analysis. We further explore the application of tensor network tools to quantum networks, offering new analytical avenues. This comprehensive approach provides a robust framework for evaluating quantum network performance under realistic error conditions, facilitating the development of reliable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of complex correlated quantum systems such as random circuit networks is governed by the dynamical buildup of both entanglement and entropy. We here introduce a real-time field theory approach -- essentially a fusion of the $G \Sigma$-functional of the SYK-model and the field theory of disordered systems -- enigneered to microscopically describe the full range of such crossover dynamics: from initial product states to a maximum entropy ergodic state. To showcase this approach in the simplest nontrivial setting, we consider a tensor product of coupled random matrices, and compare to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Self-Ordered Supersolid in Spinor Condensates with Cavity-Mediated Spin-Momentum-Mixing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms with cavity-mediated long-range interactions offer a promising platform for investing novel quantum phenomena. Exploiting recent experimental advancements, we propose an experimental scheme to create self-ordered supersolid in spin-$1/2$ condensates confined within an optical cavity. The interplay of cavity and pump fields gives rise to supersolid square and plane wave phases, comprehensively described by the two-component Tavis-Cummings model. We show that the self-ordered supersolid phase exhibits an undamped gapless Goldstone mode over a wide parameter range. This proposal, achievable with current experimental setups utilizing identical laser configurations, is in contrast to the realization of checkerboard supersolidity, which hinges on constructing a $U(1)$ symmetry by utilizing two ${\cal Z}_2$ symmetries with precisely matched atom-cavity coupling in multimode resonators. By employing the superradiant photon-exchange process, we realize for the first time cavity-mediated spin-momentum-mixing interactions between highly correlated spin and momentum modes, analogous to that observed spin-mixing in spin-1 condensates. Our scheme provides a unique platform for realizing spin-momentum squeezing and spatially distributed multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We view the mind-body problem in terms of the two interconnected problems of phenomenal consciousness and mental causation, namely, how subjective conscious experience can arise from physical neurological processes and how conscious mental states can causally act upon the physical world. In order to address these problems, I develop here a non-physicalist framework that combines two apparently antithetical views: the materialist view of the mind as a product of the brain and the metaphysical view of consciousness rooted in an underlying hidden reality. I discuss how this framework resolves the problem of mental causation while being simultaneously consistent with fundamental physical principles. I will elucidate how the framework ties in to the perspective of meaning that acts as the bridge between physical neurological processes and the conscious mind. Moreover, we will see how both our awareness of the self and our representation of the external world are connected to this perspective.</description>

      <title>Modified mean field ansatz for charged polarons in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionic Bose polarons are quantum entities emerging from the interaction between an ion and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), featuring long-ranged interactions that can compete with the gas healing length. This can result in strong interparticle correlations and enhancement of gas density around the ion. One possible approach to describe this complex system with high accuracy relies on numerical treatment such as the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques. Nevertheless, it is computationally very expensive and does not easily allow to study the system dynamics. On the other hand, a mean-field based variational ansatz in the co-moving frame can capture a sizeable change in the gas density. We apply it to the case of regularized ion-atom potential and find that it qualitatively reproduces the full numerical results. In addition, we also study the system of two pinned ions, focusing on their effective interaction induced by the bath. This approach seems to be promising for studying transport and nonequilibrium dynamics of charged (bi)polarons in condensed media.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem in energy-dependent potentials using semi-classical methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave equations with energy-dependent potentials appear in many areas of physics, ranging from nuclear physics to black hole perturbation theory. In this work, we use the semi-classical WKB method to first revisit the computation of bound states of potential wells and reflection/transmission coefficients in terms of the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule and the Gamow formula. We then discuss the inverse problem, in which the latter observables are used as a starting point to reconstruct the properties of the potentials. By extending known inversion techniques to energy-dependent potentials, we demonstrate that so-called width-equivalent or WKB-equivalent potentials are not isospectral anymore. Instead, we explicitly demonstrate that constructing quasi-isospectral potentials with the inverse techniques is still possible. Those reconstructed, energy-independent potentials share key properties with the width-equivalent potentials. We report that including energy-dependent terms allows for a rich phenomenology, particularly for the energy-independent equivalent potentials.</description>

Abstract: We explore elastic scattering of non-relativistic electrons in the form of standard Laguerre-Gaussian (sLG) and elegant Laguerre - Gaussian (eLG) packets on atomic targets in the generalized Born approximation and compare these results to the reference with Bessel-Gaussian (BG) packets. Scattering by hydrogen-like, iron, silver, and golden targets is considered. The incident electron carries a nonzero orbital angular momentum, while sLG and eLG packets have a definite radial quantum number n as well. In scattering of sLG and eLG wave packets by a macroscopic target sensitivity of the average cross section to the orbital angular momentum is observed, which is absent for BG packets. We highlight the opportunity to employ the differences in the experimental scattering results for the revelation of the properties of incident twisted electron wave packets</description>

Abstract: Bethe Ansatz was discoverd in 1932. Half a century later its algebraic structure was unearthed: Yang-Baxter equation was discovered, as well as its multidimensional generalizations [tetrahedron equation and $d$-simplex equations]. Here we describe a universal method to solve these equations using Clifford algebras. The Yang-Baxter equation ($d=2$), Zamalodchikov's tetrahedron equation ($d=3$) and the Bazhanov-Stroganov equation ($d=4$) are special cases. Our solutions form a linear space. This helps us to include spectral parameters. Potential applications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we will consider the star network scenario where the central party is trusted while all the edge parties (with a number of $n$) are untrusted. Network steering is defined with an $n$ local hidden state model which can be viewed as a special kind of $n$ local hidden variable model. Two different types of sufficient criteria, nonlinear steering inequality and linear steering inequality will be constructed to verify the quantum steering in a star network. Based on the linear steering inequality, how to detect the network steering with a fixed measurement will be discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of the energy recovery efficiency for quantum batteries composed of many identical quantum cells undergoing noise. While the possibility of using quantum effects to speed up the charging processes of batteries have been vastly investigated, In order to traslate these ideas into working devices it is crucial to assess the stability of the storage phase in the quantum battery elements when they are in contact with environmental noise. In this work we formalize this problem introducing a series of operationally well defined figures of merit (the work capacitances and the Maximal Asymptotic Work/Energy Ratios) which gauge the highest efficiency one can attain in recovering useful energy from quantum battery models that are formed by large collections of identical and independent elements (quantum cells or q-cells). Explicit evaluations of such quantities are presented for the case where the energy storing system undergoes through dephasing and depolarizing noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10885v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realistic interpretation of classical theory assumes that every classical system has well-defined properties, which may be unknown to the observer but are nevertheless part of reality and can in principle be revealed by measurements. Here we show that this interpretation can in principle be falsified if classical systems coexist with other types of physical systems. To make this point, we construct a toy theory that (i) includes classical theory as a subtheory and (ii) allows classical systems to be entangled with another type of systems, called anti-classical. We show that our toy theory allows for the violation of Bell inequalities in two-party scenarios where one of the settings corresponds to a local measurement performed on a classical system alone. Building on this fact, we show that measurements outcomes in classical theory cannot, in general, be regarded as pre-determined by the state of an underlying reality.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Transcorrelated Method enabling accurate Quantum Chemistry on near-term Quantum Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a new computational paradigm with the potential to transform several research fields, including quantum chemistry. However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate infidelities, and limited connectivity) hamper the straightforward implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient solutions. In quantum chemistry, the limited number of available qubits and gate operations is particularly restrictive since, for each molecular orbital, one needs, in general, two qubits. In this study, we propose an explicitly correlated Ansatz based on the transcorrelated (TC) approach, which transfers -- without any approximation -- correlation from the wavefunction directly into the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the number of resources needed to achieve accurate results with noisy, near-term quantum devices. In particular, we show that the exact transcorrelated approach not only allows for more shallow circuits but also improves the convergence towards the so-called basis set limit, providing energies within chemical accuracy to experiment with smaller basis sets and, therefore, fewer qubits. We demonstrate our method by computing bond lengths, dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies close to experimental results for the hydrogen dimer and lithium hydride using just 4 and 6 qubits, respectively. Conventional methods require at least ten times more qubits for the same accuracy.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we obtain the precise range of the values of the parameter $\alpha$ such that Petz-R\'enyi $\alpha$-relative entropy $D_{\alpha}(\rho||\sigma)$ of two displaced thermal states is finite. More precisely, we prove that, given two displaced thermal states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ with inverse temperature parameters $r_1, r_2,\dots, r_n$ and $s_1,s_2, \dots, s_n$, respectively, we have
  \[
  D_{\alpha}(\rho||\sigma)&lt;\infty \Leftrightarrow \alpha &lt; \min \left\{ \frac{s_j}{s_j-r_j}: j \in \{ 1, \ldots , n \} \text{ such that } r_j&lt;s_j \right\},
  \]
where we adopt the convention that the minimum of an empty set is equal to infinity. Along the way, we prove a special case of a conjecture of Seshdreesan, Lami and Wilde (J. Math. Phys. 59, 072204 (2018)).</description>

Abstract: Finding a local Hamiltonian $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ having a given many-body wavefunction $|\psi\rangle$ as its ground state, i.e. a parent Hamiltonian, is a challenge of fundamental importance in quantum technologies. Here we introduce a numerical method, inspired by quantum annealing, that efficiently performs this task through an artificial inverse dynamics: a slow deformation of the states $|\psi(\lambda(t))\rangle$, starting from a simple state $|\psi_0\rangle$ with a known $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_0$, generates an adiabatic evolution of the corresponding Hamiltonian. We name this approach inverse quantum annealing. The method, implemented through a projection onto a set of local operators, only requires the knowledge of local expectation values, and, for long annealing times, leads to an approximate parent Hamiltonian whose degree of locality depends on the correlations built up by the states $|\psi(\lambda)\rangle$. We illustrate the method on two paradigmatic models: the Kitaev fermionic chain and a quantum Ising chain in longitudinal and transverse fields.</description>

      <title>ANTN: Bridging Autoregressive Neural Networks and Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body physics simulation has important impacts on understanding fundamental science and has applications to quantum materials design and quantum technology. However, due to the exponentially growing size of the Hilbert space with respect to the particle number, a direct simulation is intractable. While representing quantum states with tensor networks and neural networks are the two state-of-the-art methods for approximate simulations, each has its own limitations in terms of expressivity and inductive bias. To address these challenges, we develop a novel architecture, Autoregressive Neural TensorNet (ANTN), which bridges tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks. We show that Autoregressive Neural TensorNet parameterizes normalized wavefunctions, allows for exact sampling, generalizes the expressivity of tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks, and inherits a variety of symmetries from autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate our approach on quantum state learning as well as finding the ground state of the challenging 2D $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model with different systems sizes and coupling parameters, outperforming both tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantum many-body physics simulation, quantum technology design, and generative modeling in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Bound State Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last few years have seen rapid development of applications of quantum computation to quantum field theory. The first algorithms for quantum simulation of scattering have been proposed in the context of scalar and fermionic theories, requiring thousands of logical qubits. These algorithms are not suitable to simulate scattering of incoming bound states, as the initial-state preparation relies typically on adiabatically transforming wavepackets of the free theory into wavepackets of the interacting theory. In this paper we present a strategy to excite wavepackets of the interacting theory directly from the vacuum of the interacting theory, allowing the preparation of states of composite particles. This is the first step towards digital quantum simulation of scattering of bound states. The approach is based on the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, which provides a way to construct creation and annihilation operators of a theory in a full, nonperturbative framework. We provide a quantum algorithm requiring a number of ancillary qubits that is logarithmic in the size of the wavepackets, and with a success probability vanishing at most like a polynomial in the lattice parameters and the energy of the wavepacket. The gate complexity for a single iteration of the circuit is equivalent to that of a time evolution for a fixed time. Furthermore, we propose a complete protocol for scattering simulation using this algorithm. We study its efficiency and find improvements with respect to previous algorithms in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random number generators employ the inherent randomness of quantum mechanics to generate truly unpredictable random numbers, which are essential in cryptographic applications. While a great variety of quantum random number generators have been realised using photonics, few exploit the high-field confinement offered by plasmonics, which enables device footprints an order of magnitude smaller in size. Here we integrate an on-chip nanowire plasmonic waveguide into an optical time-of-arrival based quantum random number generation setup. Despite loss, we achieve a random number generation rate of 14.4 Mbits/s using low light intensity, with the generated bits passing industry standard tests without post-processing. By increasing the light intensity, we were then able to increase the generation rate to 41.4 Mbits/s, with the resulting bits only requiring a shuffle to pass all tests. This is an order of magnitude increase in the generation rate and decrease in the device size compared to previous work. Our experiment demonstrates the successful integration of an on-chip nanoscale plasmonic component into a quantum random number generation setup. This may lead to new opportunities in compact and scalable quantum random number generation.</description>

Abstract: Logic gates can be written in terms of complex differential operators where the inputs and outputs are analytic functions with several variables. Using the polar representation of complex numbers, we arrive at an immediate connection between the oscillatory behavior of the system and logic gates. We explain the universal programming language (UPL) used by physical objects to process information. To assure the causality structure in UPL, we introduce the concept of layers that characterizes the computations for each time scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Markovian processes may arise in physics due to memory effects of environmental degrees of freedom. For quantum non-Markovianity, it is an ongoing debate to clarify whether such memory effects have a verifiable quantum origin, or whether they might equally be modeled by a classical memory. In this contribution, we propose a criterion to test locally for a truly quantum memory. The approach is agnostic with respect to the environment, as it solely depends on the local dynamics of the system of interest. Experimental realizations are particularly easy, as only single-time measurements on the system itself have to be performed. We study memory in a variety of physically motivated examples, both for a time-discrete case, and for time-continuous dynamics. For the latter, we are able to provide an interesting class of non-Markovian master equations with classical memory that allows for a physically measurable quantum trajectory representation.</description>

      <title>Nutation-Based Longitudinal Sensing Protocols for High-Field NMR With Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond enable nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of samples at the nano- and micron scales. However, at typical tesla-scale NMR magnetic field strengths, NV-NMR protocols become difficult to implement due to the challenge of driving fast NV pulse sequences sensitive to nuclear Larmor frequencies above a few megahertz. We perform simulations and theoretical analysis of the experimental viability of NV-NMR at tesla-scale magnetic fields using a new measurement protocol called DRACAERIS (Double Rewound ACquisition Amplitude Encoded Radio Induced Signal). DRACAERIS detects the NMR sample's longitudinal magnetization at a much lower driven Rabi frequency, more suitable technically for NV detection. We discuss how pulse errors, finite pulse lengths, and nuclear spin-spin couplings affect the resulting NMR spectra. We find that DRACAERIS is less susceptible to pulse imperfections and off-resonance effects than previous protocols for longitudinal magnetization detection. We also identify reasonable parameters for experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Metrological robustness of high photon number optical cat states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of quantum metrology, cat states have demonstrated their utility despite their inherent fragility with respect to losses. Here, we introduce noise robust optical cat states which exhibit a metrological robustness for phase estimation in the regime of high photon numbers. These cat states are obtained from the intense laser driven process of high harmonic generation (HHG), and show a resilience against photon losses. Focusing on a realistic scenario including experimental imperfections we opt for the case in which we can maximize the lower bound of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) instead of analyzing the best case scenario. We show that the decrease of the QFI in the lossy case is suppressed for the HHG-cat state compared to the even and odd counterparts. In the regime of small losses of just a single photon, the HHG-cat state remains almost pure while the even/odd cat state counterparts rapidly decohere to the maximally mixed state. More importantly, this translates to a significantly enhanced robustness for the HHG-cat against photon loss, demonstrating that high photon number optical cat states can indeed be used for metrological applications even in the presence of losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a tight parallel repetition theorem for $3$-message computationally-secure quantum interactive protocols between an efficient challenger and an efficient adversary. We also prove under plausible assumptions that the security of $4$-message computationally secure protocols does not generally decrease under parallel repetition. These mirror the classical results of Bellare, Impagliazzo, and Naor [BIN97]. Finally, we prove that all quantum argument systems can be generically compiled to an equivalent $3$-message argument system, mirroring the transformation for quantum proof systems [KW00, KKMV07].
  As immediate applications, we show how to derive hardness amplification theorems for quantum bit commitment schemes (answering a question of Yan [Yan22]), EFI pairs (answering a question of Brakerski, Canetti, and Qian [BCQ23]), public-key quantum money schemes (answering a question of Aaronson and Christiano [AC13]), and quantum zero-knowledge argument systems. We also derive an XOR lemma [Yao82] for quantum predicates as a corollary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One dimensional confinement in waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) plays a crucial role to enhance light-matter interactions and to induce a strong quantum nonlinear optical response. In two or higher dimensional settings, this response is reduced since photons can be emitted within a larger phase space, opening the question whether strong photon-photon interaction can be still achieved. In this study, we positively answer this question for the case of a 2D square array of atoms coupled to the light confined into a two-dimensional waveguide. More specifically, we demonstrate the occurrence of long-lived two-photon repulsive and bound states with genuine 2D features. Furthermore, we observe signatures of these effects also in free-space atomic arrays in the form of weakly-subradiant in-band scattering resonances. Our findings provide a paradigmatic signature of the presence of strong photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Machine Learning With Continuous Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The popular qubit framework has dominated recent work on quantum kernel machine learning, with results characterising expressivity, learnability and generalisation. As yet, there is no comparative framework to understand these concepts for continuous variable (CV) quantum computing platforms. In this paper we represent CV quantum kernels as closed form functions and use this representation to provide several important theoretical insights. We derive a general closed form solution for all CV quantum kernels and show every such kernel can be expressed as the product of Gaussian and algebraic function terms. Furthermore, we present quantification of a quantum-classical separation for all quantum kernels via a hierarchical notion of the ``stellar rank" of the quantum kernel feature map. For a particular subclass of CV kernels, we are able to directly extend this notion to the kernels themselves. In all such cases we can quantify the hardness of classical simulability of the quantum kernel. We then prove kernels defined by feature maps of infinite stellar rank, such as GKP-state encodings, can be approximated arbitrarily well by kernels defined by feature maps of finite stellar rank. Finally, we simulate learning with a single-mode displaced Fock state encoding and show that (i) accuracy on our specific task (an annular data set) increases with stellar rank, (ii) for underfit models, accuracy can be improved by increasing a bandwidth hyperparameter, and (iii) for noisy data that is overfit, decreasing the bandwidth will improve generalisation but does so at the cost of effective stellar rank and thus quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an interferometric sensor for investigating macroscopic quantum mechanics on a table-top scale. The sensor consists of pair of suspended optical cavities with a finesse in excess of 100,000 comprising 10 g fused-silica mirrors. In the current room-temperature operation, we achieve a peak sensitivity of \SI{0.5}{\fmasd} in the acoustic frequency band, limited by the readout noise. With additional suppression of the readout noise, we will be able to reach the quantum radiation pressure noise, which would represent a novel measurement of the quantum back-action effect. Such a sensor can eventually be utilised for demonstrating macroscopic entanglement and testing semi-classical and quantum gravity models.</description>

      <title>Theory of parametric resonance for discrete time crystals in fully-connected spin-cavity systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pinpoint the conditions necessary for discrete time crystal (DTC) formation in fully connected spin-cavity systems from the perspective of parametric resonance by mapping these systems onto oscillator like models. We elucidate the role of nonlinearity and dissipation by mapping the periodically driven open Dicke model onto effective linear and nonlinear oscillator models, while we analyze the effect of global symmetry breaking using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model with tunable anisotropy. We show that the system's nonlinearity restrains the dynamics from becoming unbounded when driven resonantly. On the other hand, dissipation keeps the oscillation amplitude of the period-doubling instability fixed, which is a key feature of DTCs. The presence of global symmetry breaking in the absence of driving is found to be crucial in the parametric resonant activation of period-doubling response. We provide analytic predictions for the resonant frequencies and amplitudes leading to DTC formation for both systems using their respective oscillator models.</description>

      <title>Web 3.0 and Quantum Security: Long-Distance Free-Space QSDC for Global Web 3.0 Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of Web 3.0, the swift advancement of technology confronts an imminent threat from quantum computing. Security protocols safeguarding the integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces our novel long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical contexts. Differing from techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD), LF QSDC surpasses constraints by facilitating encrypted data transmission sans key exchanges, thus diminishing the inherent weaknesses of key-based systems. The distinctiveness of this attribute, coupled with its quantum mechanics base, protects against quantum computer assaults and advanced non-quantum dangers, harmonizing seamlessly with the untrustworthy tenets of the Web 3.0 age. The focus of our study is the technical design and incorporation of LF QSDC into web 3.0 network infrastructures, highlighting its efficacy for extended-range communication. LF QSDC is based on the memory DL04 protocol and enhanced with our novel Quantum-Aware Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC), Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) technologies, and Atmospheric Quantum Correction Algorithm (AQCA). Utilizing this method not only bolsters the security of worldwide Web 3.0 networks but also guarantees their endurance in a time when quantum and sophisticated classical threats exist simultaneously. Consequently, LF QSDC stands out as a robust security solution, well-suited for Web 3.0 systems amidst the constantly evolving digital environment.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Computing for Quantum Chemistry: Reducing Circuit Complexity with Transcorrelated and Adaptive Ansatz Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The near-term utility of quantum computers is hindered by hardware constraints in the form of noise. One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ans\"atze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H$_4$, LiH, and H$_2$O. In particular, H$_4$ is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ans\"atze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ans\"atze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.</description>

Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a very simple distribution of unitaries: random (binary) phase -- Hadamard -- random (binary) phase -- random computational-basis permutation. We show that this distribution is statistically indistinguishable from random Haar unitaries for any polynomial set of orthogonal input states (in any basis) with polynomial multiplicity. This shows that even though real-valued unitaries cannot be completely pseudorandom (Haug, Bharti, Koh, arXiv:2306.11677), we can still obtain some pseudorandom properties without giving up on the simplicity of a real-valued unitary.
  Our analysis shows that an even simpler construction: applying a random (binary) phase followed by a random computational-basis permutation, would suffice, assuming that the input is orthogonal and \emph{flat} (that is, has high min-entropy when measured in the computational basis).
  Using quantum-secure one-way functions (which imply quantum-secure pseudorandom functions and permutations), we obtain an efficient cryptographic instantiation of the above.</description>

      <title>Commitments are equivalent to one-way state generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-way state generators (OWSG) are natural quantum analogs to classical one-way functions. We show that $O\left(\frac{n}{\log(n)}\right)$-copy OWSGs ($n$ represents the input length) are equivalent to $poly(n)$-copy OWSG and to quantum commitments. Since known results show that $o\left(\frac{n}{\log(n)}\right)$-copy OWSG cannot imply commitments, this shows that $O\left(\frac{n}{\log(n)}\right)$-copy OWSGs are the weakest OWSGs from which we can get commitments (and hence much of quantum cryptography).
  Our construction follows along the lines of H\r{a}stad, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby [HILL], who obtained classical pseudorandom generators (PRG) from classical one-way functions (OWF), however with crucial modifications. Our construction, when applied to the classical case, provides an alternative to the construction provided by [HILL]. Since we do not argue conditioned on the output of the one-way function, our construction and analysis are arguably simpler and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Entanglement Renormalization on a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed resource estimate for the prospect of using deep entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, focusing on the regime in which the target system is large. For probing a relatively large system size ($64\times 64$), we observe up to an order of magnitude reduction in the number of qubits, compared to the approaches based on quantum phase estimation (QPE). We discuss two complementary strategies to measure the energy. The first approach is based on a random sampling of the local terms of the Hamiltonian, requiring $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ invocations of quantum circuits, each of which have depth of at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $\epsilon$ is the relative precision in the energy and $N$ is the system size. The second approach is based on a coherent estimation of the expectation value of observables averaged over space, which achieves the Heisenberg scaling while incurring only a logarithmic cost in the system size. For estimating the energy per site of $\epsilon$, $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log N}{\epsilon} \right)$ $T$ gates and $\mathcal{O}\left(\log N \right)$ qubits suffice. The constant factor of the leading contribution is shown to be determined by the depth of the DMERA circuit, the gates used in the ansatz, and the periodicity of the circuit. We also derive tight bounds on the variance of the energy gradient, assuming the gates are random Pauli rotations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Open Quantum Dynamics via Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Markovian open quantum dynamics is essential but challenging for standard quantum computers due to their non-Hermitian nature, leading to non-unitary evolution, and the limitations of available quantum resources. Here we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed for simulating dissipative dynamics in system with non-Markovian environment. Our approach includes formulating a non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (cNMSSE) where the non-Markovianity is characterized by the mode excitation. Following this, we utilize variational quantum simulation to capture the non-unitary evolution within the cNMSSE framework, leading to a substantial reduction in qubit requirements. To demonstrate our approach, we investigated the spin-boson model and dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) within transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Significantly, our findings reveal the enhanced DQPT in TFIM due to non-Markovian behavior.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Mitigating Timing Noise-Induced Decoherence in Single Electron Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying and controlling decoherence in single electron sources (SES) is important for their applications in quantum information processing. The recent experiments with ultrashort electron pulses [J. D. Fletcher et al., Nat. Commun. 10, 5298 (2019)] demonstrate strong decoherence that cannot be caused by traditional mechanisms such as electron-electron or electron-phonon interactions. Here we propose timing noise as a universal model, consistent with existing experimental data, to explain strong decoherence of ultrafast SES pulses, without resorting to any specific microscopic mechanism for such decoherence. We also propose a protocol to filter out timing noise which works even in the presence of other decoherence effects, such as those present in, e.g., low-energy SESs.</description>

      <title>Performance of a Sagnac interferometer to observe vacuum optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Quantum Electrodynamics, vacuum becomes a nonlinear optical medium: its optical index should be modified in the presence of intense external electromagnetic fields. The DeLLight project (Deflection of Light by Light) aims to observe this effect using intense focused femtosecond laser pulses delivered by LASERIX. The principle is to measure with a Sagnac interferometer the deflection of a low-intensity focused pulse (probe) crossing the vacuum index gradient induced by a high-intensity pulse (pump). A Sagnac interferometer working with femtosecond laser pulses has been developed for the DeLLight project. Compared to previous prototypes, the interferometer now includes the focusing of the probe beam in the interaction area. In this article, we measure and characterize the critical experimental parameters limiting the sensitivity of the interferometer, namely the extinction factor, the spatial resolution, and the waist at focus of the probe pulse. We discuss future improvements.</description>

      <title>Few-magnon excitations in a frustrated spin-$S$ ferromagnetic chain with single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study few-magnon excitations in a finite-size spin-$S$ chain with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $J&gt;0$ and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $J'&lt;0$, in the presence of the single-ion (SI) anisotropy $D$. We first reveal the condition for the emergence of zero-excitation-energy states. In the isotropic case with $\Delta=\Delta'=1$ ($\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are the corresponding anisotropy parameters), a threshold of $J/|J'|$ above which the ground state is ferromagnetic is determined by exact diagonalization for short chains up to $12$ sites. Using a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states, we then map the two-magnon problem to a single-particle one on an effective open chain with both NN and NNN hoppings. The whole two-magnon excitation spectrum is calculated for large systems and the commensurate-incommensurate transition in the lowest-lying mode is found to exhibit different behaviors between $S=1/2$ and higher spins due to the interplay of the SI anisotropy and the NNN interaction. For the commensurate momentum $k=-\pi$, the effective lattice is decoupled into two NN open chains that can be exactly solved via a plane-wave ansatz. Based on this, we analytically identify in the $\Delta'-D/|J'|$ plane the regions supporting the SI or NNN exchange two-magnon bound states near the edge of the band. In particular, we prove that there always exists a lower-lying NN exchange two-magnon bound state near the band edge for arbitrary $S\geq 1/2$. Finally, we numerically calculate the $n$-magnon spectra for $S=1/2$ with $n\leq5$ by using a spin-operator matrix element method. The corresponding $n$-magnon commensurate instability regions are determined for finite chains and consistent results with prior literature are observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods have demonstrated their suitability for the study of equilibrium properties of lattice gauge theories, even close to the continuum limit. We use them in an out-of-equilibrium scenario, much less explored so far, by simulating the real-time collisions of composite mesons in the lattice Schwinger model. Constructing wave-packets of vector mesons at different incoming momenta, we observe the opening of the inelastic channel in which two heavier mesons are produced and identify the momentum threshold. To detect the products of the collision in the strong coupling regime we propose local quantitites that could be measured in current quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of a Scalar Field in a Squeezed State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy within a spherical region for a free scalar field in a squeezed state in 3+1 dimensions. We show that, even for small squeezing, a volume term appears, whose coefficient is essentially independent of the field mass. This is in line with Page's argument that the entanglement entropy in an arbitrary quantum state is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom of the smaller subsystem. It follows that squeezed states can be considered as arbitrary quantum states, in contrast to the ground or coherent states that give rise to entanglement entropy that is dominated by a term proportional to the area of the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>New method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation: Estimation of the weights of $C$, $P$ and $CP$ symmetry violating terms in positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>
