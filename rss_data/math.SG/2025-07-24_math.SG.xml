      <title>Convexity and the degenerate special Lagrangian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2015 Rubinstein--Solomon introduced the degenerate special Lagrangian equation (DSL) that governs geodesics in the space of positive Lagrangians, showed that subsolutions in the top branch of DSL are convex in space, and raised the question of whether they should be convex in space-time and whether subsolutions in the second branch possess any convexity properties. In 2019, Darvas--Rubinstein gave a partial answer to the first problem by showing subsolutions in the top branch must be bi-convex. We settle both questions. The key new ingredient is a space-time coordinate transformation that preserves the space-time Lagrangian angle and allows for a partial $C^2$ estimate. This also shows that the top two branches of the DSL subequation have a $\star$-product structure in the sense of Ross--Witt-Nystr\"om.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Homology and 3-dimensional Besse Manifolds with vanishing first Chern class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show that certain types of symplectic homology can be used as an invariant of 3-dimensional Besse manifolds, which are strict contact manifolds with periodic Reeb flow. For simplicity, we will assume our Besse structures to be a trivial plane bundle. To identify Besse manifolds with such a condition, we actually compute the first Chern class of each Besse structure and classify the Besse manifolds with vanishing first Chern class. We will also compute Robbin-Salamon indices of periodic Reeb orbits in Besse manifolds, and symplectic homology (of its filling) of certain cases. From its definition, Besse manifolds naturally become Seifert fibration and thus one can extract invariants such as the orbifold Euler characteristic and the Euler number of this Seifert fibration. These invariants will become important in our computation.</description>

      <title>Relative Calabi-Yau structures and ice quivers with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Van den Bergh showed that complete 3-Calabi-Yau algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are equivalent to Ginzburg dg algebras associated with quivers with potential. He also proved the natural generalisation to higher dimensions and non-algebraically closed ground fields. The relative version of the notion of Ginzburg dg algebra is that of Ginzburg morphism. For example, every ice quiver with potential gives rise to a Ginzburg morphism. We generalise Van den Bergh's theorem by showing that, under suitable assumptions, any morphism with a relative Calabi-Yau structure is equivalent to a Ginzburg(-Lazaroiu) morphism. In particular, in dimension 3 and over an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic 0, it is given by an ice quiver with potential. Thanks to the work of Bozec-Calaque-Scherotzke, this result can also be viewed as a non-commutative analogue of Joyce-Safronov's Lagrangian neighbourhood theorem in derived symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>Deformation Quantization with Separation of Variables of $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a deformation quantization with separation of variables of the Grassmannian $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$. A star product on $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$ can be explicitly determined as the solution of the recurrence relations for $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$ given by Hara and one of the authors (A. Sako). To provide the solution to the recurrence relations, it is necessary to solve a system of linear equations in each order. However, to give a concrete expression of the general term is not simple because the variables increase with the order of the differentiation of the star product. For this reason, there has been no formula to express the general term of the recurrence relations. In this paper, we overcome this problem by transforming the recurrence relations into simpler ones. We solve the recurrence relations using creation and annihilation operators on a Fock space. From this solution, we obtain an explicit formula of a star product with separation of variables on $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>New geometric structures on 3-manifolds: surgery and generalized geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosymplectic and normal almost contact structures are analogues of symplectic and complex structures that can be defined on 3-manifolds. Their existence imposes strong topological constraints. Generalized geometry offers a natural common generalization of these two structures: $B_3$-generalized complex structures. We prove that any closed orientable 3-manifold admits such a structure, which can be chosen to be stable, that is, generically cosymplectic up to generalized diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on virtual moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type by Miyaoka (1977) and Yau (1978). Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

      <title>Enumerative Geometry of Quantum Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We interpret the $q$-refined theta function $\vartheta_1$ of a log Calabi-Yau surface $(\mathbb{P},E)$ as a natural $q$-refinement of the open mirror map, defined by quantum periods of mirror curves for outer Aganagic-Vafa branes on the local Calabi-Yau $K_{\mathbb{P}}$. The series coefficients are all-genus logarithmic two-point invariants, directly extending the relation found in [GRZ]. Yet we find an explicit discrepancy at higher genus in the relation to open Gromov-Witten invariants of the Aganagic-Vafa brane. Using a degeneration argument, we express the difference in terms of relative invariants of an elliptic curve. With $\pi: \widehat{\mathbb{P}} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}$ the toric blow up of a point, we use the Topological Vertex [AKMV] to show a correspondence between open invariants of $K_{\mathbb{P}}$ and closed invariants of $K_{\widehat{\mathbb{P}}}$ generalizing a variant of [CLLT][LLW] to arbitrary genus and winding. We also equate winding-1, open-BPS invariants with closed Gopakumar-Vafa invariants.</description>
