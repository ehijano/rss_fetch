      <title>Commitment Gap via Correlation Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selection problems with costly information, dating back to Weitzman's Pandora's Box problem, have received much attention recently. We study the general model of Costly Information Combinatorial Selection (CICS) that was recently introduced by Chawla et al. [2024] and Bowers et al. [2025]. In this problem, a decision maker needs to select a feasible subset of stochastic variables, and can only learn information about their values through a series of costly steps, modeled by a Markov decision process. The algorithmic objective is to maximize the total value of the selection minus the cost of information acquisition. However, determining the optimal algorithm is known to be a computationally challenging problem.
  To address this challenge, previous approaches have turned to approximation algorithms by considering a restricted class of committing policies that simplify the decision-making aspects of the problem and allow for efficient optimization. This motivates the question of bounding the commitment gap, measuring the worst case ratio in the performance of the optimal committing policy and the overall optimal.
  In this work, we obtain improved bounds on the commitment gap of CICS through a reduction to a simpler problem of Bayesian Combinatorial Selection where information is free. By establishing a close relationship between these problems, we are able to relate the commitment gap of CICS to ex ante free-order prophet inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain improved approximation results for CICS, including the well-studied variant of Pandora's Box with Optional Inspection under matroid feasibility constraints.</description>

      <title>Reducing Shortcut and Hopset Constructions to Shallow Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a blackbox framework that simplifies all known parallel algorithms with near-linear work for single-source reachability and shortest paths in directed graphs. Specifically, existing reachability algorithms rely on constructing shortcuts; our blackbox allows these algorithms that construct shortcuts with hopbound $h$ to assume the input graph $G$ is ``shallow'', meaning if vertex $s$ can reach vertex $t$, it can do so in approximately $h$ hops. This assumption significantly simplifies shortcut construction [Fin18, JLS19], resulting in simpler parallel reachability algorithms. Furthermore, our blackbox extends naturally to simplify parallel algorithms for constructing hopsets and, consequently, for computing shortest paths [CFR20 , CF23 , RHM+23 ].</description>

      <title>Directed and Undirected Vertex Connectivity Problems are Equivalent for Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertex connectivity and its variants are among the most fundamental problems in graph theory, with decades of extensive study and numerous algorithmic advances. The directed variants of vertex connectivity are usually solved by manually extending fast algorithms for undirected graphs, which has required considerable effort.
  In this paper, we present a simple, black-box randomized reduction from directed to undirected vertex connectivity for dense graphs. As immediate corollaries, we largely simplify the proof for directed vertex connectivity in $n^{2+o(1)}$ time [LNP+25], and obtain a parallel vertex connectivity algorithm for directed graphs with $n^{\omega+o(1)}$ work and $n^{o(1)}$ depth, via the undirected vertex connectivity algorithm of [BJMY25]. Our reduction further extends to the weighted version of the problem. By combining our reduction with the recent subcubic-time algorithm for undirected weighted vertex cuts [CT25], we obtain the first subcubic-time algorithm for weighted directed vertex connectivity, improving upon a three-decade-old bound [HRG00] for dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved Dominance Filtering for Unions and Minkowski Sums of Pareto Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key task in multi-objective optimization is to compute the Pareto subset or frontier $P$ of a given $d$-dimensional objective space $F$; that is, a maximal subset $P\subseteq F$ such that every element in $P$ is not-dominated (it is not worse in all criteria) by any element in $F$. This process, called dominance-filtering, often involves handling objective spaces derived from either the union or the Minkowski sum of two given partial objective spaces which are Pareto sets themselves, and constitutes a major bottleneck in several multi-objective optimization techniques. In this work, we introduce three new data structures, ND$^{+}$-trees, QND$^{+}$-trees and TND$^{+}$-trees, which are designed for efficiently indexing non-dominated objective vectors and performing dominance-checks. We also devise three new algorithms that efficiently filter out dominated objective vectors from the union or the Minkowski sum of two Pareto sets. An extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetically generated and real-world data sets reveals that our new algorithms outperform state-of-art techniques for dominance-filtering of unions and Minkowski sums of Pareto sets, and scale well w.r.t. the number of $d\ge 3$ criteria and the sets' sizes.</description>

      <title>Sharp Online Hardness for Large Balanced Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding large $\gamma$-balanced independent sets in dense random bipartite graphs; an independent set is $\gamma$-balanced if a $\gamma$ proportion of its vertices lie on one side of the bipartition. In the sparse regime, Perkins and Wang established tight bounds within the low-degree polynomial (LDP) framework, showing a factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ statistical-computational gap via the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) framework tailored for stable algorithms. However, these techniques do not appear to extend to the dense setting. For the related large independent set problem in dense random graph, the best known algorithm is an online greedy procedure that is inherently unstable, and LDP algorithms are conjectured to fail even in the "easy" regime where greedy succeeds. We show that the largest $\gamma$-balanced independent set in dense random bipartite graphs has size $\alpha:=\frac{\log_b n}{\gamma(1-\gamma)}$ whp, where $n$ is the size of each bipartition, $p$ is the edge probability, and $b=1/(1-p)$. We design an online algorithm that achieves $(1-\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ whp for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We complement this with a sharp lower bound, showing that no online algorithm can achieve $(1+\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ with nonnegligible probability. Our results suggest that the same factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ gap is also present in the dense setting, supporting its conjectured universality. While the classical greedy procedure on $G(n,p)$ is straightforward, our algorithm is more intricate: it proceeds in two stages, incorporating a stopping time and suitable truncation to ensure that $\gamma$-balancedness-a global constraint-is met despite operating with limited information. Our lower bound utilizes the OGP framework; we build on a recent refinement of this framework for online models and extend it to the bipartite setting.</description>

      <title>Unclustered BWTs of any Length over Non-Binary Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every integer $n &gt; 0$ and for every alphabet $\Sigma_k$ of size $k \geq 3$, there exists a necklace of length $n$ whose Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is completely unclustered, i.e., it consists of exactly $n$ runs with no two consecutive equal symbols. These words represent the worst-case behavior of the BWT for clustering, since the number of BWT runs is maximized. We also establish a lower bound on their number. This contrasts with the binary case, where the existence of infinitely many completely unclustered BWTs is still an open problem, related to Artin's conjecture on primitive roots.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gaps with Quantum Counting Queries and Oblivious State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating the $k$-th spectral gap $\Delta_k=|\lambda_k-\lambda_{k+1}|$ and the corresponding midpoint $\mu_k=\frac{\lambda_k+\lambda_{k+1}}{2}$ of an $N\times N$ Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_N$, is an important special case of the eigenproblem with numerous applications in science and engineering. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm which approximates these values up to additive error $\epsilon\Delta_k$ using a logarithmic number of qubits. Notably, in the QRAM model, its total complexity (queries and gates) is bounded by $O\left( \frac{N^2}{\epsilon^{2}\Delta_k^2}\mathrm{polylog}\left( N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon},\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$, where $\epsilon,\delta\in(0,1)$ are the accuracy and the success probability, respectively. For large gaps $\Delta_k$, this provides a speed-up against the best-known complexities of classical algorithms, namely, $O \left( N^{\omega}\mathrm{polylog} \left( N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$, where $\omega\lesssim 2.371$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. A key technical step in the analysis is the preparation of a suitable random initial state, which ultimately allows us to efficiently count the number of eigenvalues that are smaller than a threshold, while maintaining a quadratic complexity in $N$. In the black-box access model, we also report an $\Omega(N^2)$ query lower bound for deciding the existence of a spectral gap in a binary (albeit non-symmetric) matrix.</description>

      <title>Strong Sparsification for 1-in-3-SAT via Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong sparsification}, in which constraints are not removed but variables can be merged. As our main result, we present a strong sparsification algorithm for 1-in-3-SAT. The correctness of the algorithm relies on establishing a sub-quadratic bound on the size of certain sets of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$. This result, obtained using the recent \emph{Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem} (Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao, Ann. Math. 2025), could be of independent interest. As an application, we improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for approximating linearly-ordered colourings of 3-uniform hypergraphs (H{\aa}stad, Martinsson, Nakajima and{\v{Z}}ivn{\'{y}}, APPROX 2024).</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Sum-Product Algorithms under Stochastic Rounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quality of numerical computations can be measured through their forward error, for which finding good error bounds is challenging in general. For several algorithms and using stochastic rounding (SR), probabilistic analysis has been shown to be an effective alternative for obtaining tight error bounds. This analysis considers the distribution of errors and evaluates the algorithm's performance on average. Using martingales and the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality, it provides error bounds that are valid with a certain probability and in O($\sqrt$nu) instead of deterministic worst-case bounds in O(nu), where n is the number of operations and u is the unit roundoff. In this paper, we present a general method that automatically constructs a martingale for any computation scheme with multi-linear errors based on additions, subtractions, and multiplications. We apply this generalization to algorithms previously studied with SR, such as pairwise summation and the Horner algorithm, and prove equivalent results. We also analyze a previously unstudied algorithm, Karatsuba polynomial multiplication, which illustrates that the method can handle reused intermediate computations.</description>

      <title>Efficient distributional regression trees learning algorithms for calibrated non-parametric probabilistic forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perspective of developing trustworthy AI for critical applications in science and engineering requires machine learning techniques that are capable of estimating their own uncertainty. In the context of regression, instead of estimating a conditional mean, this can be achieved by producing a predictive interval for the output, or to even learn a model of the conditional probability $p(y|x)$ of an output $y$ given input features $x$. While this can be done under parametric assumptions with, e.g. generalized linear model, these are typically too strong, and non-parametric models offer flexible alternatives. In particular, for scalar outputs, learning directly a model of the conditional cumulative distribution function of $y$ given $x$ can lead to more precise probabilistic estimates, and the use of proper scoring rules such as the weighted interval score (WIS) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) lead to better coverage and calibration properties.
  This paper introduces novel algorithms for learning probabilistic regression trees for the WIS or CRPS loss functions. These algorithms are made computationally efficient thanks to an appropriate use of known data structures - namely min-max heaps, weight-balanced binary trees and Fenwick trees. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the performance of our methods is competitive with alternative approaches. Additionally, our methods benefit from the inherent interpretability and explainability of trees. As a by-product, we show how our trees can be used in the context of conformal prediction and explain why they are particularly well-suited for achieving group-conditional coverage guarantees.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of constrained reconfiguration and motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for accurate and simple-looking metaphorical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Metaphorical maps" or "contact representations" are visual representations of vertex-weighted graphs that rely on the geographic map metaphor. The vertices are represented by countries, the weights by the areas of the countries, and the edges by contacts/ boundaries among them. The accuracy with which the weights are mapped to areas and the simplicity of the polygons representing the countries are the two classical optimization goals for metaphorical maps. Mchedlidze and Schnorr [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022] presented a force-based algorithm that creates metaphorical maps that balance between these two optimization goals. Their maps look visually simple, but the accuracy of the maps is far from optimal - the countries' areas can vary up to 30% compared to required. In this paper, we provide a multi-fold extension of the algorithm in [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022]. More specifically:
  1. Towards improving accuracy: We introduce the notion of region stiffness and suggest a technique for varying the stiffness based on the current pressure of map regions.
  2. Towards maintaining simplicity: We introduce a weight coefficient to the pressure force exerted on each polygon point based on whether the corresponding point appears along a narrow passage.
  3. Towards generality: We cover, in contrast to [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022], non-triangulated graphs. This is done by either generating points where more than three regions meet or by introducing holes in the metaphorical map.
  We perform an extended experimental evaluation that, among other results, reveals that our algorithm is able to construct metaphorical maps with nearly perfect area accuracy with a little sacrifice in their simplicity.</description>
