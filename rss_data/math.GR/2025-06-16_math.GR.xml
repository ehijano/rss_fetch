      <title>Structural Results On The Weak Commutativity Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak commutativity group $\chi(G)$ is generated by two isomorphic groups $G$ and $G^{\varphi }$ subject to the relations $[g,g^{\varphi}]=1$ for all $g \in G$. We obtain new expressions for the terms of the derived series and the lower central series of $\chi(G)$. We also present new bounds for the exponent of some sections of $\chi(G)$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of Linear Cycle Sets when the adjoint group is finite abelian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the second cohomology group of a linear cycle set with coefficients in an abelian group I, for linear cycle sets with commutative adjoint operation, focusing on the finite abelian case. It aims to classify extensions of such structures through cohomological methods. Techniques are developed to systematically construct explicitly 2-cocycles. Finally, some illustrative examples are explored to validate the theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of benign subgroup for Higman's reversing operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Higman reversing operation $\rho$ and for a set of integer-valued functions $\mathcal X$ the following has been proved. Let the subgroup $A_{\mathcal X}$ be benign in the free group $F$, let the respective finitely presented overgroup $K_{\mathcal X}$ with its finitely generated subgroup $L_{\mathcal X}$ be given for $A_{\mathcal X}$ explicitly, and let the set $\mathcal Y = \rho\mathcal X$ be obtained from $\mathcal X$ by the reversing operation $\rho$. Then $A_{\mathcal Y}$ also is benign in $F$ and, moreover, the finitely presented overgroup $K_{\mathcal Y}$ with its finitely generated subgroup $L_{\mathcal Y}$ can also be given explicitly for it. The current work is a step in development of a general algorithm for construction of explicit Higman embeddings of recursive groups into finitely presented groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab\'ert and Vir\'ag conjectured in 2005 that any embedding of a linear group over a pro-$p$ domain into the group of $p$-adic automorphisms $W_p$ should be zero-dimensional. We prove their conjecture in greater generality, namely for embeddings of linear groups over any integral domain into the automorphism group of a bounded rooted tree.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric profiles of lamplighter-like groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated amenable group $H$ satisfying some mild assumptions, we relate isoperimetric profiles of the lampshuffler group $\mathsf{Shuffler}(H)=\mathsf{FSym}(H)\rtimes H$ to those of $H$. Our results are sharp for all exponential growth groups for which isoperimetric profiles are known, including Brieussel-Zheng groups. This refines previous estimates obtained by Erschler and Zheng and by Saloff-Coste and Zheng. The most difficult part is to find an optimal upper bound, and our strategy consists in finding suitable lamplighter subgraphs in lampshufflers. This novelty applies more generally for many examples of halo products, a class of groups introduced recently by Genevois and Tessera as a natural generalisation of wreath products. Lastly, we also give applications of our estimates on isoperimetric profiles to the existence problem of regular maps between such groups.</description>

      <title>On minimal conditions in semigroups and biacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study the minimal conditions on $\mathcal{L}$-, $\mathcal{R}$- and $\mathcal{J}$-classes, denoted by $M_L$, $M_R$ and $M_J$, as well as the related notions of left/right/two-sided stability, in semigroups and biacts. In particular, we investigate the behaviour of these conditions with respect to quotients, substructures and extensions. Among other results, the following are proved. The conditions $M_L$, $M_R$ and $M_J$ are preserved under quotients (for both semigroups and biacts), but this is not the case for one- and two-sided stability. For semigroups, the conditions $M_L$, $M_R$ and one- and two-sided stability are inherited by subsemigroups of finite Green index and also by bi-ideals (and hence by one- and two-sided ideals). Moreover, a semigroup satisfies $M_L$ (or $M_R$) if and only if both an ideal and the associated Rees quotient do, but the analogue of this result fails in both directions for the condition $M_J$, and in the reverse direction for one- and two-sided stability.</description>

      <title>The determinant of \(\lll\)-smooth semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the investigation of non-zero determinants associated with finite semigroups containing a pair of non-commuting idempotents, as initiated in~\cite{Sha-Det2}. We focus on a class of semigroups, called \( \lll \)-smooth semigroups, that allow meaningful structural analysis despite the absence of \( \ll \)-transitivity. Within this framework, we develop a method for computing contracted semigroup determinants, building on and extending the approach carried over from~\cite{Sha-Det2}. These computations are motivated by applications in coding theory, particularly by the potential extending the MacWilliams theorem for codes over semigroup algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23507v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure of associated groups of symmetric quandles. Among other results, we explore the relationship between the associated group of a symmetric quandle and that of its underlying quandle. We provide a group-theoretic characterization of associated groups of symmetric quandles. Furthermore, we show that a symmetric quandle is embeddable if and only if its underlying quandle is embeddable, and we determine the abelianization of these associated groups.</description>

Abstract: It often happens in mathematics that one and the same equation is known under different names in different areas of mathematics. The famous pentagon identity appears in low-dimensional topology in different ways. In this paper, we use the tropical version of the Ptolemy equation to construct invariants of braids.</description>

Abstract: We determine the exact group structure of the abelianization of $\text{SL}_2(A)$, where $A$ is a Dedekind domain of arithmetic type with infinitely many units. In particular, our results show that $\text{SL}_2(A)^\text{ab}$ is finite, with exponent dividing $12$ when $\text{char}(A)=0$, and dividing $6$ when $\text{char}(A)&gt;0$. As illustrative cases, we compute $\text{SL}_2(A)^\text{ab}$ explicitly for instances where $A$ is the ring of integers of a real quadratic field or a cyclotomic extension.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity of systolic and Helly complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that finite (weakly) systolic and Helly complexes can be reconstructed from their boundary distances (computed in their 1-skeleta). Furthermore, Helly complexes and 2-dimensional systolic complexes can be reconstructed by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with respect to the number of vertices of the complex. Both results can be viewed as a positive contribution to a general question of Haslegrave, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan (2025). The reconstruction of a finite cell complex from the boundary distances is the discrete analogue of the boundary rigidity problem, which is a classical problem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of structures recognizes coordinates if any reduced product of structures from said class witnesses a certain kind of rigidity phenomena. We provide several equivalent characterizations of this property. This property has (at least) two remarkable consequences, one set-theoretic and one model-theoretic, for reduced products of structures of the said class. First, under appropriate set-theoretic assumptions every isomorphism between such reduced products associated with the Fr\' echet ideal lifts (modulo a finite change) to an isomorphism between products of the original structures. Second, with an additional mild assumption, it implies a strong quantifier elimination result. Of note, we show that a class recognizes coordinates if and only if an individual formula witnesses a certain syntactic property. We also consider many concrete classes of structures and determine whether or not they recognize coordinates. We place heavy emphasis on well known classes of groups, but we also discuss other classes of structures.</description>

Abstract: A finite group is called a CLT-group if it contains a subgroup corresponding to every divisor of the order of the group. It is said to be a Cyclic (Abelian) CLT group if it contains a cyclic (abelian) subgroup corresponding to every proper divisor of the order of the group. A natural number is said to be a CCLT (ACLT) number if every group of that order is a cyclic (abelian) CLT group. In this work, we classify all CCLT and ACLT numbers and study various properties of Cyclic (Abelian) CLT groups. We also show that the classes of CCLT and ACLT groups are contained in the class of supersolvable groups. Moreover, we introduce the function CCLT-degree on the set of non-cyclic finite groups and study the properties of this function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ of order $n.$ Denote the sum of the inverse-power of element orders in $G$ by $m(G).$ Let $\mathbb{Z}_n$ be the cyclic group of order $n.$ Suppose $G$ is a non-cyclic group of order $n$ then we show that $m(G)\geq \frac{5}{4}m(\mathbb{Z}_n).$ Our result improves the inequality $m(G)&gt;m(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ obtained by Baniasad Azad, M., and Khorsravi B. Moreover, this bound is best as for $n=4l, l$ odd, there exists a group $G$ of order $n$ satisfying $m(G)=\frac{5}{4}m(\mathbb{Z}_n)$. Moreover, we will establish that $\frac{1}{q-1}m(G)&lt; m(\mathbb{Z}_n)\leq \frac{4}{5}m(G),$ where $G$ is a non-cyclic group of odd order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to study factorisations of skew left braces through abelian subbraces. We prove a skew brace theoretical analog of the classical It\^o's theorem about product of two abelian groups: if $B = A_1A_2$ is a skew brace which is the product of two abelian skew subbraces $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ is a left and right ideal of $B$, then the commutator ideal $[B, B]^B$ of $B$ is an abelian brace. If $A_1$ is a left (non-necessarily right) ideal of $B$, we show that there exists a strong left ideal of $B$ contained in $A_1$ or $A_2$. We also show factorisations of relevant ideals of factorised braces that are sums and products of abelian subbraces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite group is said to be $n$-cyclic if it contains $n$ cyclic subgroups. For a finite group $G$, the ratio of the number of cyclic subgroups to the number of subgroups is known as the cyclicity degree of the group $G$ and is denoted by $cdeg (G)$. In this paper, we classify all $12$-cyclic groups. We also prove that the set of cyclicity degrees for all the finite groups is dense in $[0,1]$, which gives a solution to the problem asked by T\u{a}rn\u{a}uceanu and T\'{o}th in [20] "For every $a\in [0, 1]$, does there exist a sequence $(G_n)$ of finite groups such that $\lim_{n\to\infty} cdeg(G_n)=a$ "?</description>

Abstract: We give four alternative proofs to a formula on the number of non-congruent regular integers modulo $n$, where an integer $m$ is regular modulo $n$ if $m^2 x \equiv m \pmod{n}$ has a solution for $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. The formula, which expresses this number in terms of Euler totients of unitary divisors of $n$, is related to some recent variant of the RSA cryptosystem for regular integers modulo $n$, which is briefly outlined to underpin its significance.</description>

      <title>A Foundation of the Boltzmann Distribution, or Tiltings as the Unique Support-Preserving Convolution Endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of Boltzmann distributions is used in statistical mechanics to describe the distribution of states in systems with a given temperature. We give a novel characterization of this family as the unique one satisfying independence for uncoupled systems. The theorem boils down to a statement about endomorphisms of the convolution semigroup of finitely supported probability measures on the natural numbers, or, alternatively, about endomorphisms of the multiplicative semigroup of polynomials with non-negative coefficients.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal roots, Macdonald representations, and quasiparabolic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a simply laced Weyl group of finite type and rank $n$. If $W$ has type $E_7$, $E_8$, or $D_n$ for $n$ even, then the root system of $W$ has subsystems of type $nA_1$. This gives rise to an irreducible Macdonald representation of $W$ spanned by $n$-roots, which are products of $n$ orthogonal roots in the symmetric algebra of the reflection representation. We prove that in these cases, the set of all maximal sets of orthogonal positive roots has the structure of a quasiparabolic set in the sense of Rains--Vazirani. The quasiparabolic structure can be described in terms of certain quadruples of orthogonal positive roots which we call crossings, nestings, and alignments. This leads to nonnesting and noncrossing bases for the Macdonald representation, as well as some highly structured partially ordered sets. We use the $8$-roots in type $E_8$ to give a concise description of a graph that is known to be non-isomorphic but quantum isomorphic to the orthogonality graph of the $E_8$ root system.</description>

      <title>Minimal operations over permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the possible types of minimal operations above an arbitrary permutation group. Above the trivial group, a theorem of Rosenberg yields that there are five types of minimal operations. We show that above any non-trivial permutation group there are at most four such types. Indeed, except above Boolean groups acting freely on a set, there are only three. In particular, this is the case for oligomorphic permutation groups, for which we improve a result of Bodirsky and Chen by showing one of the types in their classification does not exist. Building on these results, we answer three questions of Bodirsky that were previously open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we construct an exotic example of a locally compact group $G$ with a Borel $2$-cocycle $\omega$ such that the non-twisted group von Neumann algebra $L(G)$ is a factor, while the twisted group von Neumann algebra $L_\omega(G)$ has a diffuse center.</description>

      <title>Knot invariants from representations of braids by automorphisms of a free group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an alternative way of computing Alexander polynomials of knots/links, based on the Artin representation of the corresponding braids by automorphisms of a free group. Then we apply the same method to other representations of braid groups discovered by Wada and compare the corresponding isotopic invariants to Alexander polynomials.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Limits of Sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper contributes to building algebraic foundations of self-organized criticality answering a previously unsolved question about the limiting structure of the extended sandpile group as well as relating it to another limit at the level of classical sandpile groups with respect to certain monomorphisms, and puts forward a concept of canonical sandpile epimorphisms, drawing an unexpected consequence about the divisibility properties of the numbers of spanning trees on rectangles.</description>
