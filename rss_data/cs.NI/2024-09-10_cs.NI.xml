      <title>Digital Twin Enabled Data-Driven Approach for Traffic Efficiency and Software-Defined Vehicular Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realms of the internet of vehicles (IoV) and intelligent transportation systems (ITS), software defined vehicular networks (SDVN) and edge computing (EC) have emerged as promising technologies for enhancing road traffic efficiency. However, the increasing number of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and EC-based applications presents multi-domain challenges such as inefficient traffic flow due to poor CAV coordination and flow-table overflow in SDVN from increased connectivity and limited ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) capacity. To address these, we focus on a data-driven approach using virtualization technologies like digital twin (DT) to leverage real-time data and simulations. We introduce a DT design and propose two data-driven solutions: a centralized decision support framework to improve traffic efficiency by reducing waiting times at roundabouts and an approach to minimize flow-table overflow and flow re-installation by optimizing flow-entry lifespan in SDVN. Simulation results show the decision support framework reduces average waiting times by 22% compared to human-driven vehicles, even with a CAV penetration rate of 40%. Additionally, the proposed optimization of flow-table space usage demonstrates a 50% reduction in flow-table space requirements, even with 100% penetration of connected vehicles.</description>

      <title>Maximization of Communication Network Throughput using Dynamic Traffic Allocation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing network throughput in real-world dynamic systems is critical, especially for diverse and delay-sensitive multimedia data types such as VoIP and video streaming. Traditional routing protocols, which rely on static metrics and single shortest-path algorithms, were unable in managing this complex information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances resource utilization while maintaining Quality of Service (QoS). Our dynamic traffic allocation model prioritizes different data types based on their delay sensitivity and allocates traffic by considering factors such as bandwidth, latency, and network failures. This approach is shown to significantly improve network throughput compared to static load balancing, especially for multimedia applications. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of this dynamic method in maximizing network throughput and maintaining QoS across various data types.</description>

      <title>IPN-V: The Interplanetary Network Visualizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Interplanetary Network (IPN) emerges as the backbone for communication between various spacecraft and satellites orbiting distant celestial bodies. This paper introduces the Interplanetary Network Visualizer (IPN-V), a software platform that integrates interplanetary communications planning support, education, and outreach. IPN-V bridges the gap between the complexities of astrodynamics and network engineering by enabling the generation and assessment of dynamic, realistic network topologies that encapsulate the inherent challenges of space communication, such as time-evolving latencies and planetary occlusions. Leveraging the power of Unity 3D and C#, IPN-V provides a user-friendly 3D interface for the interactive visualization of interplanetary networks, incorporating contact tracing models to represent line-of-sight communication constraints accurately. IPN-V supports importing and exporting contact plans compatible with established space communication standards, including NASA's ION and HDTN formats. This paper delineates the conception, architecture, and operational framework of IPN-V while evaluating its performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Towards an AI/ML-driven SMO Framework in O-RAN: Scenarios, Solutions, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture offers a paradigm shift in cellular network management and service orchestration, leveraging data-driven, intent-based, autonomous, and intelligent solutions. Within O-RAN, the service management and orchestration (SMO) framework plays a pivotal role in managing network functions (NFs), resource allocation, service provisioning, and others. However, the increasing complexity and scale of O-RANs demand autonomous and intelligent models for optimizing SMO operations. To achieve this goal, it is essential to integrate intelligence and automation into the operations of SMO. In this manuscript, we propose three scenarios for integrating machine learning (ML) algorithms into SMO. We then focus on exploring one of the scenarios in which the non-real-time RAN intelligence controller (Non-RT RIC) plays a major role in data collection, as well as model training, deployment, and refinement, by proposing a centralized ML architecture. Finally, we identify potential challenges associated with implementing a centralized ML solution within SMO.</description>

      <title>How We Lost The Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we reexamine an assumption that underpinned the development of the Internet architecture, namely that a stateless and loosely synchronous point-to-point datagram delivery service would be sufficient to meet the needs of all network applications, including those which deliver content and services to a mass audience at global scale. Such applications are inherently asynchronous and point-to-multipoint in nature. We explain how the inability of distributed systems based on this stateless datagram service to provide adequate and affordable support for them within the public (I.e., universally shared and available) network led to the development of private overlay infrastructures, specifically Content Delivery Networks and distributed Cloud data centers. We argue that the burdens imposed by reliance on these private overlays may have been an obstacle to achieving the Open Data Networking goals of early Internet advocates. The contradiction between those initial goals and the exploitative commercial imperatives of hypergiant overlay operators is offered as a possibly important reason for the negative impact of their most profitable applications (e.g., social media) and monetization strategies (e.g., targeted advertisement). We propose that one important step in resolving this contradiction may be to reconsider the adequacy Internet's stateless datagram service model.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multi-Layer Deployment for A Digital Twin Empowered Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of satellite communication technology, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STIN), which integrate satellite networks and ground networks, can realize seamless global coverage of communication services. Confronting the intricacies of network dynamics, the diversity of resource heterogeneity, and the unpredictability of user mobility, dynamic resource allocation within networks faces formidable challenges. Digital twin (DT), as a new technique, can reflect a physical network to a virtual network to monitor, analyze, and optimize the physical network. Nevertheless, in the process of constructing the DT model, the deployment location and resource allocation of DTs may adversely affect its performance. Therefore, we propose a STIN model, which alleviates the problem of insufficient single-layer deployment flexibility of the traditional edge network by deploying DTs in multi-layer nodes in a STIN. To address the challenge of deploying DTs in the network, we propose multi-layer DT deployment in a STIN to reduce system delay. Then we adopt a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheme to explore the optimal strategy of the DT multi-layer deployment problem. The implemented scheme demonstrates a notable reduction in system delay, as evidenced by simulation outcomes.</description>

      <title>Towards Resilient 6G O-RAN: An Energy-Efficient URLLC Resource Allocation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demands of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in ``NextG" cellular networks necessitate innovative approaches for efficient resource utilisation. The current literature on 6G O-RAN primarily addresses improved mobile broadband (eMBB) performance or URLLC latency optimisation individually, often neglecting the intricate balance required to optimise both simultaneously under practical constraints. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a DRL-based resource allocation framework integrated with meta-learning to manage eMBB and URLLC services adaptively. Our approach efficiently allocates heterogeneous network resources, aiming to maximise energy efficiency (EE) while minimising URLLC latency, even under varying environmental conditions. We highlight the critical importance of accurately estimating the traffic distribution flow in the multi-connectivity (MC) scenario, as its uncertainty can significantly degrade EE. The proposed framework demonstrates superior adaptability across different path loss models, outperforming traditional methods and paving the way for more resilient and efficient 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Vehicular Users Association in Urban Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to optimize vehicular user association to base stations in a mobile network. We propose an efficient heuristic solution that considers the base station average handover frequency, the channel quality indicator, and bandwidth capacity. We evaluate this solution using real-world base station locations from S\~ao Paulo, Brazil, and the SUMO mobility simulator. We compare our approach against a state of the art solution which uses route prediction, maintaining or surpassing the provided quality of service with the same number of handover operations. Additionally, the proposed solution reduces the execution time by more than 80\% compared to an exact method, while achieving optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>PANTS: Practical Adversarial Network Traffic Samples against ML-powered Networking Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple network management tasks, from resource allocation to intrusion detection, rely on some form of ML-based network-traffic classification (MNC). Despite their potential, MNCs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, which can lead to outages, poor decision-making, and security violations, among other issues.
  The goal of this paper is to help network operators assess and enhance the robustness of their MNC against adversarial inputs. The most critical step for this is generating inputs that can fool the MNC while being realizable under various threat models. Compared to other ML models, finding adversarial inputs against MNCs is more challenging due to the existence of non-differentiable components e.g., traffic engineering and the need to constrain inputs to preserve semantics and ensure reliability. These factors prevent the direct use of well-established gradient-based methods developed in adversarial ML (AML).
  To address these challenges, we introduce PANTS, a practical white-box framework that uniquely integrates AML techniques with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to generate adversarial inputs for MNCs. We also embed PANTS into an iterative adversarial training process that enhances the robustness of MNCs against adversarial inputs. PANTS is 70% and 2x more likely in median to find adversarial inputs against target MNCs compared to two state-of-the-art baselines, namely Amoeba and BAP. Integrating PANTS into the adversarial training process enhances the robustness of the target MNCs by 52.7% without sacrificing their accuracy. Critically, these PANTS-robustified MNCs are more robust than their vanilla counterparts against distinct attack-generation methodologies.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Load Balancing for Dynamic Cloud Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient load balancing is crucial in cloud computing environments to ensure optimal resource utilization, minimize response times, and prevent server overload. Traditional load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin or least connections, are often static and unable to adapt to the dynamic and fluctuating nature of cloud workloads. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive load balancing framework using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address these challenges. The RL-based approach continuously learns and improves the distribution of tasks by observing real-time system performance and making decisions based on traffic patterns and resource availability. Our framework is designed to dynamically reallocate tasks to minimize latency and ensure balanced resource usage across servers. Experimental results show that the proposed RL-based load balancer outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of response time, resource utilization, and adaptability to changing workloads. These findings highlight the potential of AI-driven solutions for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of cloud infrastructures.</description>

      <title>NetDPSyn: Synthesizing Network Traces under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the utilization of network traces for the network measurement research becomes increasingly prevalent, concerns regarding privacy leakage from network traces have garnered the public's attention. To safeguard network traces, researchers have proposed the trace synthesis that retains the essential properties of the raw data. However, previous works also show that synthesis traces with generative models are vulnerable under linkage attacks.
  This paper introduces NetDPSyn, the first system to synthesize high-fidelity network traces under privacy guarantees. NetDPSyn is built with the Differential Privacy (DP) framework as its core, which is significantly different from prior works that apply DP when training the generative model. The experiments conducted on three flow and two packet datasets indicate that NetDPSyn achieves much better data utility in downstream tasks like anomaly detection. NetDPSyn is also 2.5 times faster than the other methods on average in data synthesis.</description>

      <title>Robotic Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical robotic adhoc networks (RANETs), a type of mobile wireless adhoc networks (WANETs) supporting the WiFi-Direct modes common in internet of things and phone devices, is proposed based on a strategy of exploiting WiFi-Direct connection modes to overcome hardware restrictions. For a certain period of time the community was enthusiastic about the endless opportunities in fair, robust, efficient, and cheap communication created by the Adhoc mode of the WiFi IEEE 802.11 independent basic service set (IBSS) configuration that required no dedicated access points. The mode was a main enabler of wireless Adhoc networks (WANETS). This communication mode unfortunately did not get into the standard network cards present in IoT and mobile phones, likely due to the high energy consumption it exacts. Rather, such devices implement WiFi-Direct which is designed for star topologies. Several attempts were made to overcame the restriction and support WANETs, but they break at least the fairness and symmetry property, thereby reducing applicability. Here we show a solution for fair RANETs and evaluate the behavior of various strategies using simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Overlay Networks for Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) uses peer-to-peer communication to avoid the single point of failure problem in federated learning and has been considered an attractive solution for machine learning tasks on distributed devices. We provide the first solution to a fundamental network problem of DFL: what overlay network should DFL use to achieve fast training of highly accurate models, low communication, and decentralized construction and maintenance? Overlay topologies of DFL have been investigated, but no existing DFL topology includes decentralized protocols for network construction and topology maintenance. Without these protocols, DFL cannot run in practice. This work presents an overlay network, called FedLay, which provides fast training and low communication cost for practical DFL. FedLay is the first solution for constructing near-random regular topologies in a decentralized manner and maintaining the topologies under node joins and failures. Experiments based on prototype implementation and simulations show that FedLay achieves the fastest model convergence and highest accuracy on real datasets compared to existing DFL solutions while incurring small communication costs and being resilient to node joins and failures.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Datapath Accelerator Enhanced Off-path SmartNIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network speeds grow quickly in the modern cloud, so SmartNICs are introduced to offload network processing tasks, even application logic. However, typical multicore SmartNICs such as BlueFiled-2 are only capable of processing control-plane tasks with their embedded processors that have limited memory bandwidth and computing power. On the other hand, cloud applications evolve rapidly, such that a limited number of fixed hardware engines in a SmartNIC cannot satisfy the requirements of cloud applications. Therefore, SmartNIC programmers call for a programmable datapath accelerator (DPA) to process network traffic at line rate. However, no existing work has unveiled the performance characteristics of the existing DPA. To this end, we present the first architectural characterization of the latest DPA-enhanced BlueFiled-3 (BF3) SmartNIC. Our evaluation results indicate that BF3's DPA is significantly wimpier than the off-path Arm processor and the host CPU. However, we still identify that DPA has three unique architectural characteristics that unleash the performance potential of DPA. Specifically, we demonstrate how to take advantage of DPA's three architectural characteristics regarding computing, networking, and memory subsystems. Then we propose three important guidelines for programmers to fully unleash the potential of DPA. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct detailed case studies regarding each guideline. Our case study on key-value aggregation achieves up to 4.3$\times$ higher throughput by using our guidelines to optimize memory combinations.</description>

      <title>Wall-Street: Smart Surface-Enabled 5G mmWave for Roadside Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G mmWave roadside networks promise high-speed wireless connectivity, but face significant challenges in maintaining reliable connections for users moving at high speed. Frequent handovers, complex beam alignment, and signal attenuation due to obstacles like car bodies lead to service interruptions and degraded performance. We present Wall-Street, a smart surface installed on vehicles to enhance 5G mmWave connectivity for users inside. Wall-Street improves mobility management by (1) steering outdoor mmWave signals into the vehicle, ensuring coverage for all users; (2) enabling simultaneous serving cell data transfer and candidate handover cell measurement, allowing seamless handovers without service interruption; and (3) combining beams from source and target cells during a handover to increase reliability. Through its flexible signal manipulation capabilities, Wall-Street provides uninterrupted high-speed connectivity for latency-sensitive applications in challenging mobile environments. We have implemented and integrated Wall-Street in the COSMOS testbed and evaluated its real-time performance with three gNBs and multiple mobile clients inside a surface-enabled vehicle, driving on a nearby road. In multi-UE scenarios, Wall-Street doubles the average TCP throughput and reduces delay by 30% over a baseline 5G Standalone handover protocol.</description>

      <title>DarkDNS: Revisiting the Value of Rapid Zone Update</title>

Abstract: Malicious actors exploit the DNS namespace to launch spam campaigns, phishing attacks, malware, and other harmful activities. Combating these threats requires visibility into domain existence, ownership and nameservice activity that the DNS protocol does not itself provide. To facilitate visibility and security-related study of the expanding gTLD namespace, ICANN introduced the Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS) that shares daily zone file snapshots of new gTLD zones. However, a remarkably high concentration of malicious activity is associated with domains that do not live long enough make it into these daily snapshots. Using public and private sources of newly observed domains, we discover that even with the best available data there is a considerable visibility gap in detecting short-lived domains. We find that the daily snapshots miss at least 1% of newly registered and short-lived domains, which are frequently registered with likely malicious intent. In reducing this critical visibility gap using public sources of data, we demonstrate how more timely access to TLD zone changes can provide valuable data to better prevent abuse. We hope that this work sparks a discussion in the community on how to effectively and safely revive the concept of sharing Rapid Zone Updates for security research. Finally, as a contribution of this work, we are releasing a public live feed of newly registered domains, with the aim of enabling further research in early abuse identification.</description>

      <title>Naeural AI OS -- Decentralized ubiquitous computing MLOps execution engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08708</link>

Abstract: Over the past few years, ubiquitous, or pervasive computing has gained popularity as the primary approach for a wide range of applications, including enterprise-grade systems, consumer applications, and gaming systems. Ubiquitous computing refers to the integration of computing technologies into everyday objects and environments, creating a network of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other and with humans. By using ubiquitous computing technologies, communities can become more connected and efficient, with members able to communicate and collaborate more easily. This enabled interconnectedness and collaboration can lead to a more successful and sustainable community. The spread of ubiquitous computing, however, has emphasized the importance of automated learning and smart applications in general. Even though there have been significant strides in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, large scale adoption has been hesitant due to mounting pressure on expensive and highly complex cloud numerical-compute infrastructures. Adopting, and even developing, practical machine learning systems can come with prohibitive costs, not only in terms of complex infrastructures but also of solid expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning. In this paper we present an innovative approach for low-code development and deployment of end-to-end AI cooperative application pipelines. We address infrastructure allocation, costs, and secure job distribution in a fully decentralized global cooperative community based on tokenized economics.</description>

      <title>Ten Years of ZMap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since ZMap's debut in 2013, networking and security researchers have used the open-source scanner to write hundreds of research papers that study Internet behavior. In addition, ZMap powers much of the attack-surface management and security ratings industries, and more than a dozen security companies have built products on top of ZMap. Behind the scenes, much of ZMap's behavior - ranging from its pseudorandom IP generation to its packet construction - has quietly evolved as we have learned more about how to scan the Internet. In this work, we quantify ZMap's adoption over the ten years since its release, describe its modern behavior (and the measurements that motivated those changes), and offer lessons from releasing and maintaining ZMap.</description>

      <title>J\"ager: Automated Telephone Call Traceback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.</description>
