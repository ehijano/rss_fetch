      <title>Gliding microtubules exhibit tunable collective rotation driven by chiral active forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How chirality propagates across scales remains an open question in many biological and synthetic systems. An especially clear manifestation of this propagation is found in in vitro gliding assays of cytoskeletal filaments on surfaces, driven by molecular motors. These assays have become model systems of active matter dynamics, as they spontaneously organize into diverse dynamical states, including collective motions with chiral rotation. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying these chiral collective dynamics have remained unclear. Here, we investigate rotating active nematic order in microtubule gliding assay experiments under two stabilization conditions, each on two types of substrates. We propose that chirality in active forces exerted by motors on microtubules represents a viable mechanism for this large-scale chirality. Using Brownian dynamics simulations of self-propelled, semiflexible filaments with chiral activity, we demonstrate that coherently rotating active nematic order emerges by this mechanism even in the absence of curvature, i.e. shape chirality, of the constituent filaments. Moreover, we predict that the angular speed and handedness of the collective rotation can be tuned by modulating filament stiffness. Our findings identify a new set of sufficient microscopic ingredients for predictable propagation of chiral handedness from the molecular to the material scale in living and active matter.</description>

      <title>Origami of Multi-Layered Spaced Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) origami tessellations such as the Miura-ori are often generalized to build three-dimensional (3D) architected materials with sandwich or cellular structures. However, such 3D blocks are densely packed with continuity of the internal material, while for many engineering structures with multi-physical functionality, it is necessary to have thin sheets that are separately spaced and sparsely connected. This work presents a framework for the design and analysis of multi-layered spaced origami, which provides an origami solution for 3D structures where multiple flat sheets are intentionally spaced apart. We connect Miura-ori sheets with sparsely installed thin-sheet parallelogram-like linkages. To explore how this connectivity approach affects the behavior of the origami system, we model the rigid-folding kinematics using analytic trigonometry and rigid-body transformations, and we characterize the elastic-folding mechanics by generalizing a reduced order bar and hinge model for these 3D assemblies. The orientation of the linkages in the multi-layered spaced origami determines which of three folding paths the system will follow including a flat foldable type, a self-locking type, and a double-branch type. When the origami is flat foldable, a maximized packing ratio and a uniform in-plane shear stiffness can be achieved by strategically choosing the link orientation. We show possible applications by demonstrating how the multi-layered spaced origami can be used to build deployable acoustic cloaks and heat shields.</description>

      <title>Extracting Contact Forces in Cohesive Granular Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interparticle cohesion is prevalent in stored powders, geological formations, and infrastructure engineering, yet a comprehensive understanding of the effects of its micro-mechanics on bulk properties has not been established experimentally. One challenge has been that while photoelasticy has been widely and successfully used to measure the vector contact forces within dry granular systems, where the particle-particle interactions are solely frictional and compressive in nature, it has seen little development in systems where tensile forces are present. The key difficulty has been the inability to distinguish between compressive and tensile forces, which appear identically within the photoelastic response.
  Here, we present a novel approach which solves this problem, by an extension to the open-source PeGS (Photoelastic Grain Solver) software available at https://github.com/photoelasticity. Our new implementation divides the procedure of finding vector contact forces into two steps: first evaluating the vector contact forces on the non-cohesive particles present in the ensemble, followed by using an equilibrium constraint to solve for the forces in the bonded particles. We find that in the dilute limit, for up to 25% bonded dimers, we can solve for all forces since each particle has only one force bearing contact that can potentially transmit tensile forces. While the case of dimers is an idealised version of cohesive granular ensemble, it provides an important first step towards experimentally studying the micro-mechanics of cohesive granular materials.</description>

      <title>Charge Regulation Effect on Nanoparticles Interaction Mediated by Polyelectrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to precisely control surface charge using charged polymers is fundamental to many nanotechnology applications, enabling the design and fabrication of materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo (CR-MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct MD simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at a low salt concentration, whereas at a high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, resulting in similar interaction profiles. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing NP interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in the presence of low salt concentrations.</description>

      <title>Classifying soft elastic lattices using higher-order homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a methodology for the homogenization of periodic elastic lattices that covers the case of unstable lattices, having affine (macroscopic) or periodic (microscopic) mechanisms. The singular cell problems that are encountered when a periodic mechanism is present are naturally solved by treating the amplitude $\theta(X)$ of the mechanism as an enrichment variable. We use asymptotic second-order homogenization to derive an effective energy capturing both the strain-gradient effect $\nabla \varepsilon$ relevant to affine mechanisms, and the $\nabla \theta$ regularization relevant to periodic mechanisms, if any is present. The proposed approach is illustrated with a selection of lattices displaying a variety of effective behaviors. It follows a unified pattern that leads to a classification of these effective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Conformational properties of strictly two-dimensional equilibrium polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional monodisperse linear polymer chains are known to adopt for sufficiently large chain lengths $N$ and surface fractions $\phi$ compact configurations with fractal perimeters. We show here by means of Monte Carlo simulations of reversibly connected hard disks (without branching, ring formation and chain intersection) that polydisperse self-assembled equilibrium polymers with a finite scission energy $E$ are characterized by the same universal exponents as their monodisperse peers. Consistently with a Flory-Huggins mean-field approximation, the polydispersity is characterized by a Schulz-Zimm distribution with a susceptibility exponent $\gamma=19/16$ for all not dilute systems and the average chain length $&lt;N&gt; \propto \exp(\delta E) \phi^{\alpha}$ thus increases with an exponent $\delta = 16/35$. Moreover, it is shown that $\alpha=3/5$ for semidilute solutions and $\alpha \approx 1$ for larger densities. The intermolecular form factor $F(q)$ reveals for sufficiently large $&lt;N&gt;$ a generalized Porod scattering with $F(q) \propto 1/q^{11/4}$ for intermediate wavenumbers $q$ consistently with a fractal perimeter dimension $d_s=5/4$.</description>

      <title>Structural Order Drives Diffusion in a Granular Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how structural ordering, i.e. crystallization, affects the flow of bidisperse granular materials in a quasi-two-dimensional silo. By systematically varying the mass fraction of two particle sizes, we finely tune the degree of local order. Using high-speed imaging and kinematic modeling, we show that crystallization significantly enhances the diffusion length $b$, a key parameter controlling the velocity profiles within the flowing medium. We reveal a strong correlation between $b$ and the hexatic order parameter $\left&lt;|\psi_6|\right&gt;_t$, highlighting the role of local structural organization in governing macroscopic flow behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pressure gradients within the silo promote the stabilization of orientational order even in the absence of crystallization, thus intrinsically increasing $b$ with height. These findings establish a direct link between microstructural order, pressure, and transport properties in granular silo flows.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for 2D Rigidity Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigidity Percolation is a crucial framework for describing rigidity transitions in amorphous systems. We present a new, efficient algorithm to study central-force Rigidity Percolation in two dimensions. This algorithm combines the Pebble Game algorithm, the Newman-Ziff approach to Connectivity Percolation, as well as novel rigorous results in rigidity theory, to exactly identify rigid clusters over the full bond concentration range, in a time that scales as $N^{1.02}$ for a system of $N$ nodes. Besides opening the way to accurate numerical studies of Rigidity Percolation, our work provides new insights on specific cluster merging mechanisms that distinguish it from the standard Connectivity Percolation problem.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium distribution of the liquid phase in an unsaturated granular material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an unsaturated granular material, the spatial distribution of the liquid phase results from the competition between gravity and capillary forces. We show that, in the funicular regime, it can be described by a Boltzmann law, with static disorder playing the role of thermal agitation. We propose an approach based on a Langevin equation to derive this distribution, and compare our predictions with conductivity measurements giving the local water content as a function of height in a wet granular medium. We show that experimental data obtained with samples of different polydispersities collapse on a single master curve consistent with our model.</description>

      <title>Beyond von Mises Truss Models: Emergent Bistability in Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe and analyze the phenomenon of bistability emergent from cooperative stiffening in hyper-elastic metamaterials. Using experimental and numerical results of identical geometric designs, we show evidence that a single unit is unistable while combining two units can result in bistability. Our study demonstrates that the von Mises truss model cannot describe such emergent behavior. Hence, we construct a novel and simple analytical model to explain this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Topological weight and structural diversity of polydisperse chromatin loop networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current biophysical models for transcriptionally active chromatin view this as a polymer with sticky sites, mimicking transcription units such as promoters and enhancers which interact via the binding of multivalent complexes of chromatin-binding proteins. It has been demonstrated that this model spontaneously leads to microphase separation, resulting in the formation of a network of loops with transcription units serving as anchors. Here, we demonstrate how to compute the topological weights of loop networks with an arbitrary 1D pattern of transcription units along the fibre (or `polydisperse' loop networks), finding an analogy with networks of electric resistors in parallel or in series. We also show how the BEST (de Bruijn, van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, Smith and Tutte) theorem in combinatorics can be used to find the combinatorial multiplicity of any class of loop networks. Our results can be used to compute the structural diversity, or Shannon entropy, of loop networks: we show that this quantity depends on the 1D patterning of transcription units along the chain, possibly providing a pathway to control transcriptional noise in eukaryotic genes.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Giant Electrostatic Modulation of Ion Permeation in Atomically Small Capillaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the electrostatic double layer and tuning the conductance in nanofluidic systems at salt concentrations of 100 mM or higher has been a persistent challenge. The primary reasons are (i) the short electrostatic proximity length, ~3-10 {\AA}, and (ii) difficulties in fabricating atomically small capillaries. Here, we successfully fabricate in-plane vermiculite laminates with transport heights of ~3-5 {\AA}, which exhibit a cation selectivity close to 1 even at a 1000 mM concentration, suggesting an overlapping electrostatic double layer. For gate voltages from -2 V to +1 V, the K+-intercalated vermiculite shows a remarkable conductivity modulation exceeding 1400% at a 1000 mM KCl concentration. The gated ON/OFF ratio is mostly unaffected by the ion concentration (10-1000 mM), which confirms that the electrostatic double layer overlaps with the collective ion movement within the channel with reduced activation energy. In contrast, vermiculite laminates intercalated with Ca2+ and Al3+ ions display reduced conductance with increasing negative gate voltage, highlighting the importance of ion-specific gating effects under {\AA}-scale confinement. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrostatic phenomena occurring in highly confined fluidic channels, opening the way to the exploration of the vast library of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a family of novel mechanically-soft and magnetically-hard magnetorheological foams that, upon deformation, lead to robust and measurable magnetic flux changes in their surroundings. This allows to infer qualitatively and even quantitatively the imposed deformation and, eventually from that, an estimation of the stiffness and average stress on the sample even in complex loading scenarios involving combinations of uniform or nonuniform compression/tension with superposed shearing in different directions. The work provides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite strain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and predict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials with different particle volume fractions and then use it to estimate and design potential haptic sensing devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twist-grain-boundary (TGB) phases, characterized by a periodic, helical arrangement of blocks made of polar smectic phases, SmAF and SmCF, have been discovered. They have been observed for rod-like molecules with a strong longitudinal dipole moment, featuring an (S)-2-methylbutyl end group having only weak twisting power, and emerge below the antiferroelectric SmAAF phase, where the lamellar structure is already well established. It is suggested that the structure is governed by electrostatic interactions amplified by weak chiral forces, in striking contrast to the mechanism of TGB phase formation found in non-polar materials. The TGB phases exhibit light selective reflection in the visible range, while the value of electric polarization confirms an almost perfectly ordered dipole alignment.</description>

      <title>Engineering active motion in quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for engineering active quantum matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.</description>
