      <title>Doppler sensitivity and resonant tuning of Rydberg atom-based antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency antennas based on Rydberg atom vapor cells can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where long wires are needed to accommodate a growing wavelength. They also have other desirable features such as nonmetallic, lower profile, elements. This paper presents a detailed theoretical investigation of Rydberg antenna sensitivity, elucidating parameter regimes that could cumulatively lead to 2--3 orders of magnitude sensitivity increase beyond that of currently tested configurations. The key insight is to optimally combine the advantages of two well-studied approaches: (i) three laser ``2D star configuration'' setups that, enhanced also with increased laser power, help compensate for atom motion-induced Doppler broadening, and (ii) resonant coupling between a pair of near-degenerate Rydberg levels, tuned via a local oscillator to the incident signal. The advantage of the star setup is subtle because it only restores overall sensitivity to the expected Doppler-limited value, compensating for additional off-resonance reductions where differently moving atom populations destructively interfere with each other in the net signal. The additional unique advantage of the local oscillator tuning is that it leads to vastly narrower line widths, as low as ~10 kHz set by the intrinsic Rydberg state lifetimes, rather than the typical ~10 MHz set by the core state lifetimes. Intuitively, with this setup the two Rydberg states may be tuned to act as an independent high-q cavity, a point of view supported through a study of the frequency-dependence of the antenna resonant response. There are a number of practical experimental advances, especially larger ~1 cm laser beam widths, required to suppress various extrinsic line broadening effects and to fully exploit this cavity response.</description>

      <title>A magnetically silent optically pumped magnetometer for a neutron electric dipole moment experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the performance of a magnetically silent optically pumped cesium magnetometer with a statistical sensitivity of 3.9 pT and a stability of 90 fT over 150 seconds of measurement. Optical pumping with coherent, linearly-polarized, resonant light leads to a relatively long-lived polarized ground state of the cesium vapour contained in a measurement cell. The state precesses at its Larmor frequency in the magnetic field to be measured. Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation then leads to the rotation of the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized probe laser beam. The rotation angle is modulated at twice the Larmor frequency. A measurement of this frequency constitutes an absolute measurement of the magnetic field magnitude. Featuring purely optical operation, non-magnetic construction, low noise floor, and high stability, this sensor will be used for the upcoming TUCAN electric dipole moment experiment and other highly sensitive magnetic applications.</description>

      <title>3D surface profilometry using neutral helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11114v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional mapping of surface structures is important in a wide range of biological, technological, healthcare and research applications, including taxonomy, microfluidics and fabrication. Neutral helium atom beams have been established as a sensitive probe of topography and have already enabled structural information to be obtained from delicate samples, where conventional probes would cause damage. Here, we demonstrate empirical reconstruction of a complete surface profile using measurements from a scanning helium microscope (SHeM), using the heliometric stereo method and a single detector instrument geometry. Results for the surface profile of tetrahedral aluminum potassium sulphate crystals demonstrate the areas of surfaces and facet orientations can be recovered to within 5% of the expected values.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a two-level atom in the presence of a medium-assisted thermal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the time evolution of a two-level atom in the presence of medium-assisted thermal field is explored through which, the formula of decay rate of an excited atom is generalized in two aspects. The obtained formula applies for the thermal electromagnetic field as well as the presence of arbitrary arrangement of magneto-electric media. In order to be general with respect to the material environment, the Green's function approach is used. It is seen that the non-zero temperature contributes to the decay rate via an additive term that is equal to the zero-temperature result multiplied by two times of photon number at atomic transition frequency.</description>

      <title>Spin--spin interaction and magnetic Feshbach resonances in collisions of high-spin atoms with closed-shell atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate interactions and ultracold collisions of high-spin but spherical atoms with closed-shell atoms, focussing on the example of Cr with Yb. Such a combination has only one potential energy curve but gives rise to a substantial intra-atomic spin--spin interaction, which causes Feshbach resonances due to rotationally excited states. We find such resonances are guaranteed below 250 G and can reach widths of 10s of G in favorable circumstances. We study the effect of hyperfine structure, which can create additional wide resonances at low fields. Finally, we consider isotopic substitution and show that for any realistic potential it is very likely at least one combination of commonly used isotopes will have resonances with experimentally favorable properties. Thus, this is a promising system for both molecule formation and studying quantum mixtures including dipolar species.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing an ultracold Fermi gas against Fermi acceleration to superdiffusion through localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization, i.e., destructive quantum interference of multiple-scattering paths, halts transport entirely. Contrarily, time-dependent random forces expedite transport via Fermi acceleration, proposed as a mechanism for high-energy cosmic rays. Their competition creates interesting dynamics, but experimental observations are scarce. Here, we experimentally study the expansion of an ultracold Fermi gas inside time-dependent disorder and observe distinct regimes from sub- to superdiffusion. Unexpectedly, quantum interference counteracts acceleration in strong disorder. Our system enables the investigation of Fermi acceleration in the quantum-transport regime.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-induced transparency assists the Raman gradient echo memory at moderate detuning, dependent on gradient order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical quantum memories are essential for quantum communications and photonic quantum technologies. Ensemble optical memories based on 3-level interactions are a popular basis for implementing these memories. All such memories, however, suffer from loss due to scattering. In off-resonant 3-level interactions, such as the Raman gradient echo memory (GEM), scattering loss can be reduced by a large detuning from the intermediate state. In this work, we show how electromagnetically induced transparency adjacent to the Raman absorption line plays a crucial role in reducing scattering loss, so that maximum efficiency is in fact achieved at a moderate detuning. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the transparency, and therefore the efficiency of GEM, depends on the order in which gradients are applied to store and recall the light. We provide a theoretical analysis and show experimentally how the efficiency depends on gradient order and detuning.</description>

      <title>Stopping mass-selected alkaline-earth metal monofluoride beams of high energy via formation of unusually stable anions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct laser-coolability and a comparatively simple electronic structure render alkaline-earth metal monofluoride molecules versatile laboratories for precision tests of fundamental physics. In this theoretical work, a route for efficient stopping and cooling of high-energy hot beams of mass-selected alkaline-earth metal monofluorides via their anions is explored to facilitate subsequent precision experiments with trapped molecules. It is shown that these molecular anions possess an unusually strong chemical bond and that RaF$^-$ features properties favourable for efficient pre-cooling, indicating the applicability of direct laser-cooling of the anion.</description>
