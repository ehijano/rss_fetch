      <title>Phase distribution in 1D localization and phase transitions in single-mode waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of electrons in 1D disordered systems is usually described in the random phase approximation, when distributions of phases \varphi and \theta, entering the transfer matrix, are considered as uniform. In the general case, the random phase approximation is violated, and the evolution equations (when the system length L is increased) contain three independent variables, i.e. the Landauer resistance \rho and the combined phases \psi=\theta-\varphi and \chi=\theta+\varphi. The phase \chi does not affect the evolution of \rho and was not considered in previous papers. The distribution of the phase \psi is found to exhibit an unusual phase transition at the point E_0 when changing the electron energy E, which manifests itself in the appearance of the imaginary part of \psi. The distribution of resistance P(\rho) has no singularity at the point E_0, and the transition looks unobservable in the electron disordered systems. However, the theory of 1D localization is immediately applicable to propagation of waves in single-mode optical waveguides. The optical methods are more efficient and provide possibility to measure phases \psi and \chi. On the one hand, it makes observable the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), which can be considered as a 'trace' of the mobility edge remaining in 1D systems. On the other hand, observability of the phase \chi makes actual derivation of its evolution equation, which is presented below. Relaxation of the distribution P(\chi) to the limiting distribution P_\infty(\chi) at L\to\infty is described by two exponents, whose exponentials have jumps of the second derivative, when the energy E is changed.</description>

      <title>Replica bound for Ising spin glass models in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpolation method is a powerful tool for rigorous analysis of mean-field spin glass models, both with and without dilution. In this study, we show that the interpolation method can be applied to Ising spin glass models in one dimension, such as a one-dimensional chain and a two-leg ladder. In one dimension, the replica symmetric (RS) cavity method is naturally expected to be rigorous for Ising spin glass models. Using the interpolation method, we rigorously prove that the RS cavity method provides lower bounds on the quenched free energies of Ising spin glass models in one dimension at any finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Phases in Quantum Kirigamis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in engineering mesoscopic quantum devices have led to new material platforms where electronic transport can be achieved on foldable structures. In this respect, we study quantum phases and their transitions on a Kirigami structure, a Japanese craft form, where its individual building blocks are topologically non-trivial. In particular, we find that by mechanically deforming the Kirigami structure one can engineer topological phase transitions in the system. Using a multipronged approach, we show that the physics of the system can be captured within a transfer matrix formalism akin to Chalker-Coddington networks, where the junctions describe scattering between effective non-Hermitian one-dimensional edge channels. We further show that the nature of the Kirigami structure can affect the critical folding angles where the topological phase transitions occur. Our study shows the rich interplay between topological quantum phenomena and structural configuration of an underlying Kirigami network reflecting its potential as an intriguing platform.</description>

      <title>Frustrated ferroelectricity from interlocked topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking can manifest intricate domain patterns that allow the exploration of topological defects and their potential applications, such as domain-wall nanoelectronics. Engineering actual devices remains a challenge as domain patterns have complexity-driven properties whose origin and nature are still obscure. In relaxor ferroelectrics, dominant unconventional behavior, including thermal hysteresis and dielectric dispersion, is believed to result from frustrated dynamics of mesoscopic polar nanoregions (PNRs), where competing interaction terms among multiple components allow emergent phenomena as the result of minimizing conflicts. Existing theories propose analogies with Griffiths' phases or glassy states but fail to provide a full description, making relaxors a paradigm of hereto unexplained non-ergodic phenomenology. Here, we propose an explanatory mechanism based on the competition between intrinsic mesoscopic scales that naturally arise from discrete-inversion-symmetry-breaking and topological charge-screening flux-closure constraints. Computational analysis and experimental results on domain patterns in potassium-lithium-tantalate-niobate (KTN:Li) identify the key role of spontaneous polarization vortices, dependent on the ratio between collinear and non-collinear interactions. Our findings introduce a new perspective on frustration mechanisms, demonstrating how geometrical concepts are a fundamental ingredient in emergent ferroelectric behavior. They also shed light on the physics of ferroelectric topological defects, a possible route to noise-resistant memory and processing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative dynamics of flat-band systems with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for the time evolution of Gaussian wave packets on flat-band lattices in the presence of correlated disorder. To achieve this, we introduce a method to generate random on-site energies with prescribed correlations. We verify this method with a one-dimensional (1D) cross-stitch model, and find good agreement with analytical results obtained from the disorder-dressed evolution equations. This allows us to reproduce previous findings, that disorder can mobilize 1D flat-band states which would otherwise remain localized. As explained by the corresponding disorder-dressed evolution equations, such mobilization requires an asymmetric disorder-induced coupling to dispersive bands, a condition that is generically not fulfilled when the flat-band is resonant with the dispersive bands at a Dirac point-like crossing. We exemplify this with the 1D Lieb lattice. While analytical expressions are not available for the two-dimensional (2D) system due to its complexity, we extend the numerical method to the 2D $\alpha-T_3$ model, and find that the initial flat-band wave packet preserves its localization when $\alpha = 0$, regardless of disorder and intersections. However, when $\alpha\neq 0$, the wave packet shifts in real space. We interpret this as a Berry phase controlled, disorder-induced wave-packet mobilization. In addition, we present density functional theory calculations of candidate materials, specifically $\rm Hg_{1-x}Cd_xTe$. The flat-band emerges near the $\Gamma$ point ($\bf{k}=$0) in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for the electrical conductance of random resistor networks which mimic crack-template-based transparent conductive films</title>

Abstract: We studied random resistor networks produced with regular structure and random distribution of edge conductances. These networks are intended to mimic crack-template-based transparent conductive films as well some random networks produced using nano-imprinting technology. Applying an effective medium theory, we found out that the electrical conductance of such networks is $\approx 0.5852 \sqrt{n_E}$, where $n_E$ is the number density of conductive edges. This dependence is in agreement with numerical calculations in Voronoi networks, although the effective conductances are approximately 15\% larger.</description>

      <title>Universal Aspects of High-Temperature Relaxation Dynamics in Random Spin Models</title>

Abstract: Universality is a crucial concept in modern physics, allowing us to capture the essential features of a system's behavior using a small set of parameters. In this work, we unveil universal spin relaxation dynamics in anisotropic random Heisenberg models with infinite-range interactions at high temperatures. Starting from a polarized state, the total magnetization can relax monotonically or decay with long-lived oscillations, determined by the sign of a universal single function $A=-\xi_1^2+\xi_2^2-4\xi_2\xi_3+\xi_3^2$. Here $(\xi_1,\xi_3,\xi_3)$ characterizes the anisotropy of the Heisenberg interaction. Furthermore, the oscillation shows up only for $A&gt;0$, with frequency $\Omega \propto \sqrt{A}$. To validate our theory, we compare it to numerical simulations by solving the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equation with a melon diagram approximation and the exact diagonalization (ED). The results show our theoretical prediction works in both cases, regardless of a small system size $N=8$ in ED simulations. Our study sheds light on the universal aspect of quantum many-body dynamics beyond low energy limit.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoregressive Neural Networks for Classical Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient sampling and approximation of Boltzmann distributions involving large sets of binary variables, or spins, are pivotal in diverse scientific fields even beyond physics. Recent advances in generative neural networks have significantly impacted this domain. However, these neural networks are often treated as black boxes, with architectures primarily influenced by data-driven problems in computational science. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel autoregressive neural network architecture named TwoBo, specifically designed for sparse two-body interacting spin systems. We directly incorporate the Boltzmann distribution into its architecture and parameters, resulting in enhanced convergence speed, superior free energy accuracy, and reduced trainable parameters. We perform numerical experiments on disordered, frustrated systems with more than 1000 spins on grids and random graphs, and demonstrate its advantages compared to previous autoregressive and recurrent architectures. Our findings validate a physically informed approach and suggest potential extensions to multivalued variables and many-body interaction systems, paving the way for broader applications in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spatial patterns and synchronization in superconducting time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a time crystal phase characterized by a frequency half of the driving frequency in disordered superconductors by employing the time dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism at zero temperature with a periodically driven coupling constant. After a period of exponential increase of spatial inhomogeneities and exponential suppression of the order parameter amplitude, the time crystal develops islands of different sizes. Each of these islands is a time crystal with the same frequency albeit with a phase shift $\pi$ with respect to the homogeneous time crystal. After its emergence, the island gradually becomes smaller, though the phase shift persists, until it is abruptly synchronized at a time that it depends on its initial size. We find a critical disorder strength, still deep in the metallic phase, at which the time crystal phase terminates. For even stronger disorder, the order parameter oscillates with the driving frequency in regions where localization effects are not important.</description>
