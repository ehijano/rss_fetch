      <title>On multiplicities in length spectra of semi-arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that semi-arithmetic surfaces of arithmetic dimension two which admit a modular embedding have exponential growth of mean multiplicities in their length spectrum. Prior to this work large mean multiplicities were rigorously confirmed only for the length spectra of arithmetic surfaces. We also discuss the relation of the degeneracies in the length spectrum and quantization of the Hamiltonian mechanical system on the surface.</description>

      <title>The Hamiltonian surface of $\Aut(F_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group of automorphisms of the free group on two generators is known to act geometrically, in an essentially unique way, on a 2-dimensional CAT(0) space X. We prove that X contains precisely two Hamiltonian surfaces. By this we mean a surface in X which visits every vertex and every edge precisely once.</description>

      <title>Continuous Noncrossing Partitions and Weighted Circular Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines noncrossing partitions of the unit circle in the complex plane; we call these continuous noncrossing partitions. More precisely, we focus on the degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions where unit complex numbers in the same block have identical $d$-th powers. We prove that the degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions form a topological poset whose uncountable set of elements can be indexed by equivalence classes of objects we call weighted linear factorizations of factors of a $d$-cycle. Moreover, the maximal elements in this poset form a subspace homeomorphic to the dual Garside classifying space for the $d$-strand braid group.
  The degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions of the unit circle are a special case of a more general construction. For every choice of Coxeter element $c$ in any Coxeter group $W$ we define a topological poset of equivalence classes of weighted linear factorizations of factors of $c$ in $W$ whose elements we call continuous $c$-noncrossing partitions. The maximal elements in this poset form a subspace homeomorphic to the one-vertex complex whose fundamental group is the corresponding dual Artin group.</description>

      <title>Configuration Spaces of Colored Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is intended to provide concrete examples of concepts discussed elsewhere in this volume, especially splittings of groups and non-positively curved cube complexes but also other things. The idea of the construction (configuration spaces) is not new, but this family of examples doesn't seem to be well-known. Nevertheless they arise in a variety of contexts; applications are discussed in the last section. Most proofs are omitted.</description>

      <title>The strong convergence phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal 2005 paper, Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen discovered that the norm of any noncommutative polynomial of independent complex Gaussian random matrices converges to that of a limiting family of operators that arises from Voiculescu's free probability theory. In recent years, new methods have made it possible to establish such strong convergence properties in much more general situations, and to obtain even more powerful quantitative forms of the strong convergence phenomenon. These, in turn, have led to a number of spectacular applications to long-standing open problems on random graphs, hyperbolic surfaces, and operator algebras, and have provided flexible new tools that enable the study of random matrices in unexpected generality. This survey aims to provide an introduction to this circle of ideas.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of $E$-unitary and $R_1$-injective special inverse monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the structure of general subgroups (in particular maximal subgroups, also known as group $\mathcal{H}$-classes) of special inverse monoids. Recent research of the authors has established that these can be quite wild, but in this paper we show that if we restrict to special inverse monoids which are $E$-unitary (or have a weaker property we call $\mathcal{R}_1$-injectivity), the maximal subgroups are strongly governed by the group of units. In particular, every maximal subgroup has a finite index subgroup which embeds in the group of units. We give a construction to show that every finite group can arise as a maximal subgroup in an $\mathcal{R}_1$-injective special inverse monoid with trivial group of units. It remains open whether every combination of a group $G$ and finite index subgroup $H$ can arise as maximal subgroup and group of units.</description>

      <title>Infinite systems of equations in abelian and nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every abelian (and even every nilpotent) group contains a solution of any finite unimodular system of equations over itself. However, this is not true for infinite systems. We deduced a criterion for a periodic abelian group to contain a solution of any infinite unimodular system of equations over itself. Using this criterion, we show that nilpotent groups of bounded period also contain solutions of all infinite unimodular systems of equations over themselves. Solvability of every nonsingular infinite system of equations in each divisible nilpotent group is shown as well.</description>

      <title>A general construction of simultaneously hyperbolic elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an explicit construction of simultaneously hyperbolic elements in a group acting on finitely many Gromov-hyperbolic spaces under the weakest conditions. This essentially generalizes results of Clay-Uyanik in \cite{CU18}, of Genevois in \cite{Gen19}, and of Balasubramanya-Fern\'{o}s in \cite{BF24}. Besides, we show that the set of simultaneously hyperbolic elements has strictly positive density with respect to any proper word metric under the weakest conditions. This recovers many classical counting results, eg. the main result of Wiest in \cite{Wie17}.
  As an important ingredient in the proof of main results, we show that the set of simultaneously contracting elements in a group acting on finitely many metric spaces with contracting property has strictly positive density with respect to any proper word metric. This generalizes two results of Wan-Xu-Yang in \cite{WXY24} and of Balasubramanya-Fern\'{o}s in \cite{BF24}.</description>

      <title>Fundamental $n$-quandles of links are residually finite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the residual finiteness and subquandle separability of quandles, properties that respectively imply the solvability of the word problem and the generalized word problem for quandles. From Winker's work, we know that fundamental $n$-quandles of oriented links, which are canonical quotients of their fundamental quandles, are closely associated with $n$-fold cyclic branched covers of the 3-sphere branched over these links. We prove that the fundamental $n$-quandle of any oriented link in the 3-sphere is residually finite for each $n\ge 2$. This supplements the recent result by Bardakov, Singh and the third author on residual finiteness of fundamental quandles of oriented links, and the classification by Hoste and Shanahan of links whose fundamental $n$-quandles are finite for some $n$. We also establish several general results on these finiteness properties and identify many families of quandles admitting them.</description>

      <title>Gradings on nilpotent Lie algebras associated with the nilpotent fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties</title>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group $N$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{n}$ is
  $p$-filiform. We show that $\Gamma$ is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental
  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension less than or
  equal to six to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's Theorem 90, periodicity, and roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a cyclic field extension of degree $n$, and let $\sigma$ generate the group ${\rm Gal}(E/F)$. If ${\rm Tr}^E_F(y)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sigma^i y=0$, then the additive form of Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that $y=\sigma x-x$ for some $x\in E$. When $E$ has characteristic $p&gt;0$ we prove that $x$ gives rise to a periodic sequence $x_0,x_1,\dots$ which has period $pn_p$, where $n_p$ is the largest $p$-power that divides $n$. We also show, if $y$ lies in the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, then the roots of a reducible Artin-Schreier polynomial $t^p-t-y$ have the form $x+u$ where $u\in\mathbb{F}_p$ and $x=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}y^{p^i}$ for some $z\in\mathbb{F}_{p^e}$ with $e=n_p$. Furthermore, the sequence $\left(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}\right)_{i\ge0}$ is periodic with period $pe$.</description>
