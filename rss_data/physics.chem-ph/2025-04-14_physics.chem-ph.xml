      <title>Molecular Axis Distribution Moments in Ultrafast Transient Absorption Spectroscopy: A Path Towards Ultrafast Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments with gas phase molecules, the alignment of the molecular axis relative to the polarization of the interacting laser pulses plays a crucial role in determining the dynamics following this light-matter interaction. The molecular axis distribution is influenced by the interacting pulses and is intrinsically linked to the electronic coherences of the excited molecules. However, in typical theoretical calculations of such interactions, the signal is either calculated for a single molecule in the molecular frame or averaged over all possible molecular orientations to compare with the experiment. This averaging leads to the loss of information about anisotropy in the molecular-axis distribution, which could significantly affect the measured experimental signal. Here, we calculate the laboratory frame transient electronic first-order polarization ($P^{(1)}$) spectra in terms of separated molecular frame and laboratory frame quantities. The laboratory frame polarizations are compared with orientation-averaged Quantum Master Equation (QME) calculations, demonstrating that orientation-averaging captures only the isotropic contributions. We show that our formalism allows us to also evaluate the anisotropic contributions to the spectrum. Finally, we discuss the application of this approach to achieve ultrafast quantum state tomography using transient absorption spectroscopy and field observables in nonlinear spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field: A Conceptually Novel Approach for Nonadiabatic Quantum Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.</description>

      <title>Are nonequilibrium effects relevant for chiral molecule discrimination?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing and discriminating between enantiomers of chiral molecules remains a significant challenge in the design of sensor platforms. In the case of chemoresistive sensors, where detection relies on changes in electrical response upon analyte adsorption, the sensor substrate is typically functionalized with chirality sensitive molecular receptors. In this computational study, we investigate whether a chirality-blind substrate, such as a graphene nanoribbon, is still capable of discriminating between enantiomers. To this end, we employ a density-functional parametrized tight-binding method combined with nonequilibrium Green functions. For a small set of chiral amino acids, we demonstrate that accounting for the nonequilibrium response of the device leads to significant differences in the electrical currents of enantiomeric pairs of the order tens of nanoamperes. This effect is further amplified when structural fluctuations of the device's active region are considered (1-2 microAmp). Moreover, we propose new quantum-mechanical quantities for enantioselective discrimination in molecular sensors, with an emphasis on binding features and property-property correlations. Therefore, our work demonstrates the significance of nonequilibrium effects in chiral discrimination, laying the foundation for future investigations addressing the design of chiral molecular sensors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Chemical Reactions in Open Systems Reduced by PEA and QSSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have primarily focused on the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) occurring in closed systems. In contrast, CRNs in open systems exhibit much richer nonequilibrium phenomena due to sustained matter and energy exchange. Here, we bridge the quantitative relationships between essential thermodynamic quantities -- including the steady state, enthalpy, intrinsic Gibbs free energy, and entropy production rate -- in original mass-action equations and their PEA- or QSSA-reduced counterparts for open CRNs. Our analysis demonstrates that the thermodynamic structure, especially the second law of thermodynamics, of the full CRNs may not be preserved in reduced models when algebraic relations are imposed. Specifically, PEA-reduced models lose monotonicity in the intrinsic Gibbs free energy, whereas QSSA retains this property. These theoretical findings are further validated through analytical and numerical studies of two archetypal open systems: the Michaelis-Menten reactions and the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC). Our results provide a systematic framework for evaluating the fidelity of reduced models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and contrasting exchange-correlation functional differences in response to static correlation in unrestricted Kohn-Sham and a hybrid 1-electron reduced density matrix functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hybrid Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) and 1-electron Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory (1-RDMFT) has recently been developed to describe strongly correlated systems at mean-field computational cost. This approach relies on combining a Reduced Density Matrix Functional to capture strong correlation effects with existing exchange correlation (XC) functionals to capture the remaining dynamical correlation effects. In this work, we systematically benchmark the performance of nearly 200 different XC functionals available within LibXC in this DFA 1-RDMFT framework, contrasting it with their performance in unrestricted KS-DFT. We identify optimal XC functionals for use within DFA 1-RDMFT and elucidate fundamental trends in the response of different XC functionals to strong correlation in both DFA 1-RDMFT and UKS-DFT.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Integrator Scheme for Sampling the (Quantum) Isobaric-Isothermal Ensemble in (Path Integral) Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because most chemical or biological experiments are performed under conditions of controlled pressure and temperature, it is important to simulate the isobaric-isothermal ensemble at the atomic level to reveal the microscopic mechanism. By extending our configuration sampling protocol for the canonical ensemble, we propose a unified middle scheme to sample the coordinate (configuration) and volume distribution and thereby are able to accurately simulate either classical or quantum isobaric-isothermal processes. Various barostats and thermostats can be employed in the unified middle scheme for simulating real molecular systems with or without holonomic constraints. In particular, we demonstrate the recommended middle scheme by employing the Martyna-Tuckerman-Tobias-Klein barostat and stochastic cell-rescaling barostat, with the Langevin thermostat, in molecular simulation packages (DL_POLY, Amber, Gromacs, etc.). Benchmark numerical tests show that, without additional numerical effort, the middle scheme is competent in increasing the time interval by a factor of 5~10 to achieve the same accuracy of converged results for most thermodynamic properties in (path integral) molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Explicit core-hole single-particle methods for L- and M- edge X-ray absorption and electron energy-loss spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-particle methods based on Kohn-Sham unoccupied states to describe near-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra are routinely applied for the description of K-edge spectra, as there is no complication due to spin-orbit (SO) coupling. L- and M-edge spectra are often addressed via variants of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based on SO calculations. Here, we present a computationally efficient implementation based on single-particle calculations with core holes within the frozen-core approximation. Combined with a semiempirical energy shift and a fixed spin-orbit splitting, this allows for a prediction of experimental spectra on the absolute energy scale. Such spectra are compared to linear-response TDDFT for molecules and show similar or even better match with experiment, except for multiplet effects that are not covered by the single-particle approximation. A similar picture emerges for solids, where good qualitative and sometimes even quantitative agreement to XAS and electron energy-loss spectra is achieved.</description>

      <title>Systematic discrepancies between reference methods for non-covalent interactions within the S66 dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions is necessary to model a wide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to aqueous solutions and many more. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely-trusted methods for treating non-covalent interactions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than 7.5 kcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown. Moreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized complexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such disagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to previous CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods. Finally, we have pinpointed model systems: the hydrogen-bonded acetic acid dimer (ID 20) and dispersion-dominated uracil-cyclopentane dimer (ID 42), where these discrepancies are particularly prominent. These systems offer cost-effective benchmarks to guide future developments in DMC, CCSD(T) as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Accuracy Limit of Foundation Neural Network Models with Quantum Monte Carlo Forces and Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an end-to-end integrated strategy to produce highly accurate quantum chemistry (QC) synthetic datasets (energies and forces) aimed at deriving Foundation Machine Learning models for molecular simulation. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT), a "Jacob's Ladder" approach leverages computationally-optimized layers of massively GPU-accelerated software with increasing accuracy. Thanks to Exascale, this is the first time that the computationally intensive calculation of Quantum Monte Carlo forces (QMC), and the combination of multi-determinant QMC energies and forces with selected-Configuration Interaction wavefunctions, are computed at such scale at the complete basis-set limit. To bridge the gap between accurate QC and condensed-phase Molecular Dynamics, we leverage transfer learning to improve the DFT-based FeNNix-Bio1 foundation model. The resulting approach is coupled to path integrals adaptive sampling quantum dynamics to perform nanosecond reactive simulations at unprecedented accuracy. These results demonstrate the promise of Exascale to deepen our understanding of the inner machinery of complex biosystems.</description>
