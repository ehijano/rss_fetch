      <title>Search for a Hidden Sector Scalar from Kaon Decay in the Di-Muon Final State at ICARUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for long-lived particles (LLPs) produced from kaon decay that decay to two muons inside the ICARUS neutrino detector. This channel would be a signal of hidden sector models that can address outstanding issues in particle physics such as the strong CP problem and the microphysical origin of dark matter. The search is performed with data collected in the Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at Fermilab corresponding to $2.41\times 10^{20}$ protons-on-target. No new physics signal is observed, and we set world-leading limits on heavy QCD axions, as well as for the Higgs portal scalar among dedicated searches. Limits are also presented in a model-independent way applicable to any new physics model predicting the process $K\to \pi+S(\to\mu\mu)$, for a long-lived particle S. This result is the first search for new physics performed with the ICARUS detector at Fermilab. It paves the way for the future program of long-lived particle searches at ICARUS.</description>

      <title>Reweighting simulated events using machine-learning techniques in the CMS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data analyses in particle physics rely on an accurate simulation of particle collisions and a detailed simulation of detector effects to extract physics knowledge from the recorded data. Event generators together with a GEANT-based simulation of the detectors are used to produce large samples of simulated events for analysis by the LHC experiments. These simulations come at a high computational cost, where the detector simulation and reconstruction algorithms have the largest CPU demands. This article describes how machine-learning (ML) techniques are used to reweight simulated samples obtained with a given set of model parameters to samples with different parameters or samples obtained from entirely different models. The ML reweighting method avoids the need for simulating the detector response multiple times by incorporating the relevant information in a single sample through event weights. Results are presented for reweighting to model variations and higher-order calculations in simulated top quark pair production at the LHC. This ML-based reweighting is an important element of the future computing model of the CMS experiment and will facilitate precision measurements at the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model validation for neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements are needed to improve interaction modeling to meet the precision needs of neutrino experiments in efforts to measure oscillation parameters and search for physics beyond the Standard Model. We review the difficulties associated with modeling neutrino-nucleus interactions that lead to a dependence on event generators in oscillation analyses and cross section measurements alike. We then describe data-driven model validation techniques intended to address this model dependence. The method relies on utilizing various goodness-of-fit tests and the correlations between different observables and channels to probe the model for defects in the phase space relevant for the desired analysis. These techniques shed light on relevant mis-modeling, allowing it to be detected before it begins to bias the cross section results. We compare more commonly used model validation methods which directly validate the model against alternative ones to these data-driven techniques and show their efficacy with fake data studies. These studies demonstrate that employing data-driven model validation in cross section measurements represents a reliable strategy to produce robust results that will stimulate the desired improvements to interaction modeling.</description>

      <title>LHC EFT WG Note: Basis for Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we give a definitive basis for the dimension-eight operators leading to quartic -- but no cubic -- interactions among electroweak gauge bosons. These are often called anomalous quartic gauge couplings, or aQGCs. We distinguish in particular the CP-even ones from their CP-odd counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Stars have been recognized as optimal laboratories to probe axion properties. In the last decades there have been significant advances in this field due to a better modelling of stellar systems and accurate observational data. In this work we review the current status of constraints on axions from stellar physics. We focus in particular on the Sun, globular cluster stars, white dwarfs and (proto)-neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Generative Unfolding with Distribution Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning enables unbinned, highly-differential cross section measurements. A recent idea uses generative models to morph a starting simulation into the unfolded data. We show how to extend two morphing techniques, Schr\"odinger Bridges and Direct Diffusion, in order to ensure that the models learn the correct conditional probabilities. This brings distribution mapping to a similar level of accuracy as the state-of-the-art conditional generative unfolding methods. Numerical results are presented with a standard benchmark dataset of single jet substructure as well as for a new dataset describing a 22-dimensional phase space of Z + 2-jets.</description>

      <title>Limits on Kaluza-Klein Portal Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phenomenology of dark-matter (DM) scenarios within radius-stabilized Randall-Sundrum models. Specifically, we consider models where the dark matter candidates are Standard Model (SM) singlets confined to the TeV brane and interact with the SM via spin-2 and spin-0 gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. We compute the thermal relic density of DM particles in these models by applying recent work showing that scattering amplitudes of massive spin-2 KK states involve an intricate cancellation between various diagrams. Considering the resulting DM abundance, collider searches, and the absence of a signal in direct DM detection experiments, we show that spin-2 KK portal DM models are highly constrained. We confirm that within the usual thermal freeze-out scenario, scalar dark matter models are essentially ruled out. In contrast, we show that fermion and vector dark matter models are viable in a region of parameter space in which dark matter annihilation through a KK graviton is resonant. Specifically, vector models are viable for dark matter masses ranging from 1.1 TeV to 5.5 TeV for theories in which the scale of couplings of the KK modes is of order 40 TeV or lower. Fermion dark matter models are viable for a similar mass region, but only for KK coupling scales of order 20 TeV. In this work, we provide a complete description of the calculations needed to arrive at these results and, in an appendix, a discussion of new KK-graviton couplings needed for the computations, which have not previously been discussed in the literature. Here, we focus on models in which the radion is light, and the back-reaction of the radion stabilization dynamics on the gravitational background can be neglected. The phenomenology of a model with a heavy radion and the consideration of the effects of the radion stabilization dynamics on the DM abundance are being addressed in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interference between the Atmospheric and Solar Neutrino Oscillation Sub-Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interference between the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation sub-amplitudes is said to be responsible for CP violation (CPV) in neutrino appearance channels. More precisely, CPV is generated by the interference between the parts of the neutrino oscillation amplitude which are CP even and CP odd: even or odd when the neutrino mixing matrix is replaced with its complex conjugate. This is the CPV interference term, as it gives a contribution to the oscillation probability, the square of the amplitude, which is opposite in sign for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and is unique. For this interference to be non-zero, at least two sub-amplitudes are required. There are, however, other interference terms, which are even under the above exchange, these are the CP conserving (CPC) interference terms. In this paper, we explore in detail these CPC interference terms and show that they cannot be uniquely defined, as one can move pieces of the amplitude from the atmospheric sub-amplitude to the solar sub-amplitude and vice versa. This freedom allows one to move the CPC interference terms around, but does not let you eliminate them completely. We also show that there is a reasonable definition of the atmospheric and solar sub-amplitudes for the appearance channels such that in neutrino disappearance probability there is no atmospheric-solar CPC interference term. However, with this choice, there is a CPC interference term within the atmospheric sector.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Limit of Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the origin of high-energy hadronic jets ('jet tagging') has been a critical benchmark problem for machine learning in particle physics. Jets are ubiquitous at colliders and are complex objects that serve as prototypical examples of collections of particles to be categorized. Over the last decade, machine learning-based classifiers have replaced classical observables as the state of the art in jet tagging. Increasingly complex machine learning models are leading to increasingly more effective tagger performance. Our goal is to address the question of convergence -- are we getting close to the fundamental limit on jet tagging or is there still potential for computational, statistical, and physical insights for further improvements? We address this question using state-of-the-art generative models to create a realistic, synthetic dataset with a known jet tagging optimum. Various state-of-the-art taggers are deployed on this dataset, showing that there is a significant gap between their performance and the optimum. Our dataset and software are made public to provide a benchmark task for future developments in jet tagging and other areas of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Sketch of the resolution of the axial U(1) problem without chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism which explains the masses of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons without invoking the explicit violation of $U(1)_A$ symmetry by the chiral anomaly. It is shown that the U(1) problem, the problem for which the prediction of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ masses in the simple chiral perturbation theory largely deviates from the experimental values, is actually resolved by considering the first order contribution of the disconnected meson correlator with respect to the quark mass. The bound of Weinberg $m_\eta^2 \le 3 m_\pi^2$ is fulfilled by considering the negative squared mass of $\eta$ or $\eta'$ which is just the saddle point of the QCD effective potential, and 20% level agreements with experimental data are obtained by just fitting one low energy constant. We provide the leading chiral Lagrangian due to the disconnected contribution in 3-flavor QCD, and also discuss the 2- and 4-flavor cases as well as the consistency of our mechanism with the chiral restoration at high temperature found in lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>Medium-induced modification of groomed and ungroomed jet mass and angularities in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration presents a new suite of jet substructure measurements in Pb-Pb and pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. These measurements provide access to the internal structure of jets via the momentum and angle of their constituents, probing how the quark-gluon plasma modifies jets, an effect known as jet quenching. Jet grooming additionally removes soft wide-angle radiation to enhance perturbative accuracy and reduce experimental uncertainties. We report the groomed and ungroomed jet mass $m_\mathrm{jet}$ and jet angularities $\lambda_\alpha^\kappa$ using $\kappa=1$ and $\alpha&gt;0$. Charged-particle jets are reconstructed at midrapidity using the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm with resolution parameter $R = 0.2$. A narrowing of the jet mass and angularity distributions in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp is observed and is enhanced for groomed results, confirming modification of the jet core. By using consistent jet definitions and kinematic cuts between the mass and angularities for the first time, previous inconsistencies in the interpretation of quenching measurements are resolved, rectifying a hurdle for understanding how jet quenching arises from first principles and highlighting the importance of a well-controlled baseline. These results are compared with a variety of theoretical models of jet quenching, providing constraints on jet energy-loss mechanisms in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Predicting New Above-Threshold Molecular States Via Triangular Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering that the experimentally observed molecular states are significantly fewer than those predicted theoretically, and that these states are traditionally classified as lying below thresholds while several candidates are found above them, we propose to broaden the definition of molecular states to include those that exist just above the thresholds. Identifying resonance peaks in invariant mass distributions and scattering cross-sections is crucial for probing these states, yet the mechanisms responsible for such enhancements remain unclear, complicating our understanding of new particle production. While the peaks linked to triangular singularities do not correspond to true hadronic states, the associated production mechanisms may provide valuable insight into the search for genuine hadrons. In this work, we propose employing the triangular singularity mechanism to theoretically investigate yet-to-be-observed molecular states, particularly those that could test heavy quark symmetry. We argue that these states may have true masses surpassing the thresholds of their constituent components, rather than being predicted to be below them by theoretical models. Our findings suggest the possible existence of 16 additional heavy quark molecular states, including $Y(4320)$, $Z(4430)$, and $\Upsilon(11020)$, which are posited to contain $D_1\bar{D}$, $D_1\bar{D}^{*}$, and $B_{s1}\bar{B}$ constituents, respectively. The recognition of these states would substantiate heavy quark symmetry and enhance our understanding of hadronic dynamics and molecular states formation.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Electromagnetic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are neutral in the Standard Model, but they have tiny charge radii generated by radiative corrections. In theories Beyond the Standard Model, neutrinos can also have magnetic and electric moments and small electric charges (millicharges). We review the general theory of neutrino electromagnetic form factors, which reduce, for ultrarelativistic neutrinos and small momentum transfers, to the neutrino charges, effective charge radii, and effective magnetic moments. We discuss the phenomenology of these electromagnetic neutrino properties and we review the existing experimental bounds. We briefly review also the electromagnetic processes of astrophysical neutrinos and the neutrino magnetic moment portal in the presence of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Detector integration at HEPS: a systematic, efficient and high-performance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At least 25 kinds of detector-like devices need to be integrated in Phase I of the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), and the work needs to be carefully planned to maximise productivity with highly limited human resources. After a systematic analysis on the actual work involved in detector integration, a separation of concerns between collaborating groups of personnel is established to minimise the duplication of efforts. To facilitate software development for detector integration, the ADGenICam library, which abstracts repeated code in EPICS modules for cameras, is extended to support a much wider range of detectors. An increasingly considerable fraction of detectors, both inside and outside HEPS, offer performance that exceed capabilities of the areaDetector framework in EPICS. Given this background, areaDetector's limitations in performance and architecture are analysed, and a QueueIOC -based framework that overcomes these limitations is introduced. A simple, flexible ZeroMQ-based protocol is used for data transport in this framework, while RDMA transport and multi-node readout will be explored for higher data throughputs. By calling C/C++ libraries from within Python, the performance of the former and the expressiveness of the latter can coexist nicely; the expressiveness allows for much higher efficiency in the implementation and use of integration modules functionally comparable to their EPICS counterparts.</description>

      <title>A versatile framework for attitude tuning of beamlines at advanced light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aside from regular beamline experiments at light sources, the preparation steps before these experiments are also worth systematic consideration in terms of automation; a representative category in these steps is attitude tuning, which typically appears in names like beam focusing, sample alignment etc. With the goal of saving time and manpower in both writing and using in mind, a Mamba-based attitude-tuning framework is created. It supports flexible input/output ports, easy integration of diverse evaluation functions, and free selection of optimisation algorithms; with the help from Mamba's infrastructure, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can also be readily integrated. The tuning of a polycapillary lens and of an X-ray emission spectrometer are given as examples for the general use of this framework, featuring powerful command-line interfaces (CLIs) and friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow comfortable human-in-the-loop control. The tuning of a Raman spectrometer demonstrates more specialised use of the framework with customised optimisation algorithms. With similar applications in mind, our framework is estimated to be capable of fulfilling a majority of attitude-tuning needs. Also reported is a virtual-beamline mechanism based on easily customisable simulated detectors and motors, which facilitates both testing for developers and training for users.</description>
