      <title>Fractional diffusion without disorder in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse how simple local constraints in two dimensions lead a defect to exhibit robust, non-transient, and tunable, subdiffusion. We uncover a rich dynamical phenomenology realised in ice- and dimer-type models. On the microscopic scale the path of a single defect exhibits anomalously long retractions, amounting to dynamical caging in a continuous-time random-walk framework, culminating in an effective fractional diffusion equation. Mapping to a height field yields an effective random walk subject to an emergent (entropic) logarithmic potential, whose strength is tunable, related to the exponent of algebraic ground-state correlations. The defect's path, viewed as non-equilibrium growth process, yields a frontier of fractal dimension of $5/4$, the value for a loop-erased random walk, rather than $4/3$ for simple and self-avoiding random walks. Such frustration/constraint-induced subdiffusion is expected to be relevant to platforms such as artificial spin ice and quantum simulators aiming to realize discrete link models and emergent gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Generation of Higher-order Spin-Orbit Couplings, Topology and Persistent Spin Texture in Light-Irradiated Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have been identified as the third category of magnetic materials, exhibiting momentum-dependent spin splitting characterized by even powers of momentum. In this study, we show that when subjected to elliptically polarized light, these materials serve as an exemplary framework for the dynamic generation of topological bands featuring higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Notably, while the generated Zeeman field remains invariant to the particular altermagnetic ordering, the induced higher-order SOCs are related to the magnitude and symmetry of the altermagnetic order. Specifically, we show that an altermagnet exhibiting $k^n$-spin splitting can generate spin-orbit couplings up to $k^{n-1}$. In the limit of circularly polarized light, the only correction is $k^{n-1}$, with all lower-order contributions being nullified. Interestingly, light-induced SOCs significantly impact the low-energy band topology, where their Chern numbers change by $\Delta C =\pm 1,2,3$ for $d,g,f$-wave altermagnets. Finally, we find a critical field in which a persistent spin texture is realized, a highly desirable state with predicted infinite spin lifetime. Our work showcases light as a powerful, controllable tool for engineering complex and exciting phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>

      <title>Interface-Generated Spin Current Induced Magnetoresistance in RuO2/Py Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic-like spin-split bands and antiferromagnetic-like compensated magnetic order, have attracted significant interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising altermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and strong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and theoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground state, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic character. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate spin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the N\'eel vector. Here, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py) heterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects generated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative angular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction perpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic field-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that interface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly governs the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface effects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our results show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and should not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step in this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic contributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic influences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Modifications in the photoionization cross-section of a quantum dot with position-dependent effective mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the photoionization cross-section of an electron confined in a quantum dot, considering the position-dependent variation of the effective mass through the parameter $\gamma$. We used a theoretical model based on the Schr\"odinger equation, in which $\gamma$ influences the energy levels and wave functions through an effective potential obtained from the harmonic oscillator potential - which, in the limit $\gamma = 0$, reduces to the original harmonic oscillator potential. Furthermore, we compared the modifications in the photoionization cross-section of these quantum systems with the constant-mass case. Our results demonstrate that even a small variation in $\gamma$ significantly impacts the photoionization process's amplitude and peak position. We also found that for specific values of $\gamma$, an inversion occurs: The amplitude, which initially increases as the quantum dot absorbs the photon, begins to decrease. Additionally, we observed that the optical transitions involving the ground state restrict the admissible values of $\gamma$ to negative values only. These results may have relevant implications for designing optoelectronic devices based on quantum dots with adjustable mass properties.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Potassium Chains on Silicon Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nanoribbons (SiNRs), characterized by a pentagonal structure composed of silicon atoms, host one-dimensional (1D) Dirac Fermions and serve as a minimalist atomic template for adsorbing various heteroatoms. Alkali-metal (AM) atoms, such as Na and K, with electronic structures comparable to those of hydrogen are of particular interest for such adsorption studies. However, the adsorption of AM atoms on SiNRs and its tunation on the properties of SiNRs have not yet been fully explored. In this study, we examined the adsorption of K atoms on high-aspect-ratio SiNRs and the resultant electronic properties using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory calculations. K atoms prefer to adsorb on double- and multi-stranded SiNRs owing to the low adsorption energies at these sites. Each K atom and its three nearest Si atoms exhibit a triangular morphology resulting from charge transfer between K and Si atoms, as verified by theoretical calculations. As the K coverage of the SiNRs increased, the K atoms organize into 1D zigzag chains on the SiNRs. Moreover, K adsorption on the SiNRs was determined to be reversible. The deposition of K atoms on the SiNRs was achieved using a voltage pulse of the STM tip, without damaging the SiNRs structure. In addition, K adsorption effectively modulates the Dirac cone position of the SiNRs relative to the Fermi level. This study unveils the adsorption mechanism of AM atoms on SiNRs, providing a useful approach for heteroatom adsorption on other nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Fast reversal of N\'{e}el vectors in antiferromagnets via domain-wall motion driven by vertically injected spin currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the steady propagation of 180-degree domain walls (180DWs) of N\'{e}el vectors in thin antiferromagnetic strips under perpendicularly injected spin currents with various polarization orientations. Our results show that only spin currents polarized normally to the strip plane guarantee a quick and steady rigid flow of 180DWs, thus realize a fast reversal of N\'{e}el vectors in antiferromagnets (AFMs). Different from the common ``current-in-plane'' geometry which is feasible only for metallic AFMs, our ``current-out-of-plane'' layout under investigation can further apply to insulating AFMs (which are more common in real applications) via quantum tunneling effect. Results from this work paves the way for fine control of N\'{e}el vectors in (both metallic and insulating) AFM strips and further development of novel magnetic nanodevices based on them.</description>

      <title>Signatures of exceptional points in multiterminal superconductor-normal metal junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian, multiterminal superconducting-normal system in order to identify experimental signatures of exceptional points. We focus on a minimal setting with a single spinful level, spin-dependent normal leads, and a noncollinear magnetic field. This system hosts both topologically-protected, as well as symmetry-protected exceptional points. Using an exact transport formalism, we show that the exceptional points are visible through spectroscopy of the Andreev states, but that they have a minor effect on the Josephson current. We also argue that these findings hold with interactions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dipolar-exchange spin wave spectrum in thin ferromagnetic bilayers with inplane magnetization, incorporating interlayer exchange coupling and intra- and interlayer dipolar interactions. In the continuum approximation we analyze the nonreciprocity of propagating magnetic stray fields emitted by spin waves as a function of the relative orientation of the layer magnetizations that are observable by magnetometry of synthetic antiferromagnets or weakly coupled type-A van der Waals antiferromagnetic bilayers as a function of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Multiple topological corner states in the continuum of extended kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice is renowned for its exotic electronic properties, such as flat bands, Dirac points, and Van Hove singularities. These features have provided a fertile ground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we discover that a breathing kagome lattice with long-range hoppings can host multiple zero-energy corner states, which emerge as topologically protected bound states in the continuum (BICs). This result demonstrates that additional hopping control can induce further non-trivial physics of the kagome lattice. Since the zero-energy corner states in the continuum are intertwined with a substantial number of zero-energy bulk states, we also develop a momentum-space topological characterization theory to precisely quantify the number of corner states, revealing a general bulk-corner correspondence. Furthermore, we uncover three distinct types of topological phase transitions (TPTs) for the BICs driven by shifts in the spatial localization of zero-energy bulk and/or edge states. These TPTs are exactly captured by our characterization theory. This work provides deep insights into the topological physics of the kagome lattice and broadens the understanding of its electronic properties</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants from the Green's function diagonal zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the analytical properties of the Green's function and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators, focusing on three-dimensional inversion-symmetric systems. We show that the diagonal zeros of the Green's function in the orbital basis provide a direct and visual way to calculate the strong and weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. We introduce the surface of crossings of diagonal zeros in the Brillouin zone, and show that it separates TRIMs of opposite parity in two-band models, enabling the visual computation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants by counting the relevant TRIMs on either side. In three-band systems, a similar property holds in every case except when a trivial band is added in the band gap of a non-trivial two-band system, reminiscent of the band topology of fragile topological insulators. Our work could open avenues to experimental measurements of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants using ARPES measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient spin filtering through Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing ab initio simulations, we study the spin-dependent electronic transport characteristics within Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures. The electronic density of states for both free-standing and device-configured Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ (F4GT) confirms its ferromagnetic metallic nature and reveals a weak interface interaction between F4GT and PtTe$_2$ electrodes, enabling efficient spin filtering. We observe a decrease in the magnetic anisotropy energy of F4GT in the device configuration, indicating reduced stability of magnetic moments and heightened sensitivity to external conditions. The transmission eigenstates of PtTe$_2$/ monolayer F4GT/PtTe$_2$ heterostructures demonstrate interference patterns affected by relative phases and localization, notably different in the spin-up and spin-down channels. The ballistic transport through a double-layer F4GT with a ferromagnetic configuration sandwiched between two PtTe$_2$ electrodes is predicted to exhibit an impressive spin polarization of 97$\%$ with spin-up electrons exhibiting higher transmission probability than spin-down electrons. Moreover, we investigate the spin transport properties of Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$/GaTe/Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures sandwiched between PtTe$_2$ electrodes to explore their potential as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in spintronic devices. The inclusion of GaTe as a 2D semiconducting spacer between F4GT layers results in a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 487$\%$ at low bias and decreases with increasing bias voltage. In general, our findings underscore the potential of F4GT / GaTe / F4GT heterostructures to advance spintronic devices based on van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of the Nonlinear Lindblad Master Equation Based on Quantum Trajectory Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since precisely controlling dissipation in realistic environments is challenging, digital simulation of the Lindblad master equation (LME) is of great significance for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems. However, achieving long-time simulations for complex systems with multiple dissipation channels remains a major challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose a 2-dilation digital simulation scheme for the non-linear Lindblad master equation (NLME) based on quantum trajectory averaging. The NLME continuously interpolates between full LME and the dynamical equation governed by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Remarkably, for standard LMEs, our scheme reduces to a 1-dilation method that enables deterministic realizations without postselection. This deterministic nature overcomes a key limitation in some existing simulation methods, where repeated postselections lead to exponentially vanishing implementation probabilities. Consequently, our scheme allows efficient long-time simulations of LMEs with multiple jump operators. As a demonstration, we present numerical experiments simulating novel theoretical predictions in open quantum systems, including localization in open quantum systems and the postselected skin effect.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Morphological Transformations of a Ag-Cu Nanocatalyst During CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion of CO2 into high-value chemicals through a photoreduction reaction in water is a promising route to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Ag nanoparticles can drive this reaction via localized surface plasmon resonance, but their low selectivity limits usage in industry. Enhancing selectivity toward hydrocarbons or alcohols requires addition of a co-catalyst such as Cu. However, the stabilized surface state created by Ag-Cu interactions is still poorly understood. In this work, soft x-ray Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and Grazing-Incidence X-ray Scattering (AP-GIXS) were used to investigate the evolution of Ag-Cu nanoparticles under CO2RR-like conditions. AP-XPS revealed Ag and Cu surface and sub-surface diffusion, while AP-GIXS tracked change of shape and size of nanoparticles induced by diffusion mechanics. Under 532 nm laser irradiation, further oxidation of Cu and Ag sub-surface diffusion were observed, providing invaluable insights into the dynamic restructuring of the catalyst under reaction conditions.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and non-thermal states in cryogenic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of photons in a cryogenic cavity, made by cryo-cooled mirrors surrounded by a room temperature environment. We model such a system as a multimode cavity coupled to two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Using a Lindblad master equation approach, we derive the photon distribution and the statistical properties of the cavity modes, finding an overall non-thermal state described by a mode-dependent effective temperature. We also calculate the dissipation rates arising from the interaction of the cavity field with the external environment and the mirrors, relating such rates to measurable macroscopic quantities. These results provide a simple theory to calculate the dissipative properties and the effective temperature of a cavity coupled to different thermal reservoirs, offering potential pathways for engineering dissipations and photon statistics in cavity settings.</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic exchange, anisotropy and skyrmionic textures in two-dimensional FeXZ$_{2}$ (\textit{X} = Nb, Ta and \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te) ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FeNbTe$_{2}$, long known as a van der Waals metallic system, has recently been resynthesized and shown to exhibit ferromagnetic order. In this study, using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we aim to provide a deeper insight into the magnetic properties of FeNbTe$_{2}$ and its related compounds (FeXZ$_{2}$, \textit{X} = Nb, Ta; \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te), in their two-dimensional form, including their non-centrosymmetric Janus counterparts. Our results indicate that these materials are energetically, dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, supporting the possibility of FeNbTe$_{2}$ exfoliation and potential for experimental realization of new compounds. An evolutionary structure search suggests that FeNbTe$_{2}$ retains its monoclinic symmetry in the monolayer form. Our analysis of hopping parameters obtained from Wannierization of DFT bands shows that the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions are primarily direct, while second-nearest and more distant interactions are mediated by the chalcogen atoms. Interestingly, although the second-nearest-neighbor interactions are smaller in magnitude, they appear to play a key role in determining the magnetic ordering in these systems. We also find evidence of canted magnetic anisotropy in FeXZ$_{2}$ compounds, with relatively strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and easy-axis deviations of up to 41$^\circ$ from the out-of-plane direction-an uncommon and potentially useful feature for spintronic applications. Curie temperatures estimated from Monte Carlo simulations are below room temperature but above cryogenic levels for most compounds. Micromagnetic simulations revealed that Janus-structured FeNbSeTe can host N\'eel-type skyrmions even in the absence of an external magnetic field, making this compound a suitable candidate for further experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Bismuth plasmonic antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bismuth is a particularly promising alternative plasmonic metal because of its theoretically predicted wide spectral bandwidth. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated the correlation between the shape and size of individual bismuth plasmonic antennas and their optical properties. To this end, we employed a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Bar-shaped and bowtie bismuth plasmonic antennas of various sizes were fabricated by focused ion beam lithography of a polycrystalline bismuth thin film. Our experimental findings demonstrate that these antennas support localised surface plasmon resonances and their dipole modes can be tuned through their size from the near-infrared to the entire visible spectral region. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that bismuth exhibits a plasmon dispersion relation that is nearly identical to that of gold while maintaining its plasmonic performance even at higher plasmon energies, thus rendering it a promising low-cost alternative to gold.</description>

      <title>Shear Stress Build-up Under Constant Strain Conditions in Soft Glassy Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the transient rheological behavior of two soft glassy materials: a clay dispersion and a silica gel, emphasizing their unconventional shear stress build-up behavior under conditions of constant imposed strain. For both materials, the elastic modulus and static yield stress undergo time-dependent evolution or aging. In addition, following an intense period of pre-shearing (i.e. shear-melting or destructuration), the material relaxation time is observed to show a stronger than linear dependence on the sample age, suggestive of hyper-aging dynamics. We show that these features are consistent with non-monotonic steady-state shear stress/shear rate flow curves characterized by a local stress minimum. When a steady shear flow is suddenly ceased, and the total imposed sample strain is held constant, both materials show an initial relaxation of the shear stress followed by a period of shear stress buildup, resulting in a local minimum in the evolution of shear stress with time. For the clay dispersion, the intensity of these effects increases with higher pre-shear rates, whereas for the silica gel, the effects are largely independent of the pre-shear rate. We also propose a simple time-dependent linear Maxwell model, which qualitatively predicts the experimentally observed trends in which the shear stress build-up is directly related to a monotonic increase in the elastic modulus, giving keen insight into this peculiar phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Bio-heat regimes in fractal-based models of tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous heat diffusion is investigated for biological tissues displaying a fractal structure and long-term thermal memory, which is modeled via a fractional derivative. For increasing values of the fractional derivation order, the tissue temperature displays three kinds of bio-heat regimes: damped (or sub-diffusive), critical damping and under-damped oscillations. The temperature profiles depend on the fractal dimension of the tissue but notably also on a parameter related to its topology: the spectral dimension. The parametric analysis reveals that these two parameters have antagonistic effects on the pseudo period of the temperature oscillations and their amplitudes. We discuss how our results might impact some treatment protocols.</description>

      <title>Electron beam precession for a serial crystallography experiment in a TEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the last few years, serial electron crystallography (Serial Electron Diffraction, SerialED) has been gaining attention for the structure determination of crystalline compounds that are sensitive to the irradiation of the electron beam. By recording a single electron diffraction pattern per crystal, indexing hundreds or even thousands of measured particles, and merging the reflection intensities of the successfully indexed patterns, one can retrieve crystal structure models with strongly mitigated beam damage contributions. However, one of the technique's bottlenecks is the need to collect that many diffraction patterns, which, done in an automated way, results in low indexing rates. This work demonstrates how to overcome this limitation by performing the serial crystallography experiment following a semi-automated routine with a precessed electron beam (Serial Precession Electron Diffraction, SerialPED). The precession movement increases the number of reflections present in the diffraction patterns and dynamical effects related to specific orientations of the crystals with respect to the electron beam are smoothed out. This leads to more uniform reflection intensities across the serial dataset and a smaller number of patterns are required to merge the reflection intensities for good statistics. Furthermore, structure refinements based on the dynamical diffraction theory become accessible, providing a novel approach for more accurate structure models. In this context, the use of beam precession is presented as an advantageous tool for serial electron crystallography as it enables reliable crystal structure analysis with a lower amount of diffraction data.</description>

      <title>Measurement Induced Dynamics and Trace Preserving Replica Cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general methodology for addressing the infinite hierarchy problem that arises in measurement-induced dynamics of replicated quantum systems. Our approach introduces trace-preserving replica cutoffs using tomographic-like techniques to estimate higher-order replica states from lower ones, ensuring that partial trace reduction properties are rigorously maintained. This guarantees that the dynamics of single-replica systems correctly reduce to standard Lindblad evolution. By systematically mapping information between replica spaces of different orders, we characterise null spaces under partial trace operations and outline efficient algorithmic approaches to enforce positivity. Importantly, it is demonstrated that pre-calculated stochastic Gaussian ensembles of free fermion states provide an effective and computationally efficient means to stabilise the replica hierarchy, even in the presence of interactions. Numerical tests on small interacting fermionic systems illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach, showing precise agreement with trajectory methods while providing significantly better statistical convergence.</description>

      <title>Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of charge and spin conductance as well as charge and spin quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise as probes to analyze and contrast Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR bound states, induced by magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within the superconducting gap, are distinct from MBS, which can also arise in systems with magnetic impurities, such as magnetic adatoms on superconductors, often leading to false positives in MBS detection. Replacing a trivial $s$-wave superconductor with a topological superconductor featuring triplet pairing, e.g., chiral-$p$ or spinless $p$-wave superconducting nanowire, we analyze and establish clear distinctions between YSR states and MBS. This work provides an unique signature for YSR states, demonstrating that charge or spin conductance as well as both charge and spin quantum noise, along their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts are effective in identifying YSR bound states and distinguishing them from MBS.</description>

      <title>A robust theory of thermal activation in magnetic systems with Gilbert damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic systems can exhibit thermally activated transitions whose timescales are often described by an Arrhenius law. However, robust predictions of such timescales are only available for certain cases. Inspired by the harmonic theory of Langer, we derive a general activation rate for multi-dimensional spin systems. Assuming local thermal equilibrium in the initial minimum and deriving an expression for the flow of probability density along the real unstable dynamical mode at the saddle point, we obtain the expression for the activation rate that is a function of the Gilbert damping parameter, $\alpha$. We find that this expression remains valid for the physically relevant regime of $\alpha\ll1$. When the activation is characterized by a coherent reorientation of all spins, we gain insight into the prefactor of the Arrhenius law by writing it in terms of spin wave frequencies and, for the case of a finite antiferromagnetic spin chain, obtain an expression that depends exponentially on the square of the system size indicating a break-down of the Meyer-Neldel rule.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical analytical approach to universal spectral correlations in Brownian Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an analytical approach to the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlators in zero-dimensional Brownian models of quantum chaos. The approach expresses these spectral correlations as part of a closed hierarchy of differential equations that can be formulated for all system sizes and in each of the three standard symmetry classes (unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic, as determined by the presence and nature of time-reversal symmetry). The hierarchy applies exactly, and in the same form, to Dyson's Brownian motion and all systems with stochastically emerging basis invariance, where the model-dependent information is subsumed in a single dynamical time scale whose explicit form we also establish. We further verify this universality numerically for the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, for which we find perfect agreement with the analytical predictions of the symmetry class determined by the number of fermions. This results in a complete analytical description of the spectral correlations and allows us to identify which correlations are universal in a large class of models.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports the compatibility of heterostructure-based spin qubit devices with industrial CMOS technology. It features Si/Si-Ge quantum dot devices fabricated using Infineon's 200 mm production line within a restricted thermal budget. The devices exhibit state-of-the-art charge sensing, charge noise and valley splitting characteristics, showing that industrial fabrication is not harming the heterostructure quality. These measured parameters are all correlated to spin qubit coherence and qubit gate fidelity. We describe the single electron device layout, design and its fabrication process using electron beam lithography. The incorporated standard 90 nm back-end of line flow for gate-layer independent contacting and wiring can be scaled up to multiple wiring layers for scalable quantum computing architectures. In addition, we present millikelvin characterization results. Our work exemplifies the potential of industrial fabrication methods to harness the inherent CMOS-compatibility of the Si/Si-Ge material system, despite being restricted to a reduced thermal budget. It paves the way for advanced quantum processor architectures with high yield and device quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Sliding Luttinger Liquid and Topological Flat Bands in Symmetry Mismatched Moir\'e Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we analyze a class of Moir\'e models consisting of an active honeycomb monolayer such as graphene or a hexagonal transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) on top of a substrate, in which the K and K' valleys of the active layer are folded near each other by a suitably chosen substrate geometry. Generalizing the so-called ``coupled-valley'' model of Scheer et al. [1], we start from a microscopic tight-binding description, deriving a continuum model from Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory and obtaining an effective description of the low-energy momentum states in either valley as well as the explicit microscopic forms of the Moir\'e potentials. We then consider two explicit symmetry-mismatched Moir\'e geometries with a rectangular substrate, the first of which displays an emergent time-reversal symmetry as well as a broad parameter regime which displays quasi-1D physics characterized by the existence of a Sliding Luttinger Liquid phase. This model also has a nontrivial topological character, captured by the Berry curvature dipole. The second geometry displays an emergent $C_3$ rotational symmetry despite the rectangular substrate, reducing to a continuum model considered in Ref. [1] that was shown to display honeycomb and Kagome topological flat bands.</description>

Abstract: We continue our investigations of the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar-Hall and planar-thermal Hall configurations, involving three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals, by considering here nodes hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles. Such systems exemplify multifold semimetals, as they have three bands crossing at a nodal point. We derive the explicit expressions of the electric, thermoelectric, and thermal coefficients, when the nodes are subjected to the combined influence of an electric field (and/or temperature gradient) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field. In order to have a complete description, we consider the effects of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment on an equal footing, both of which originate from the underlying topological features of the bandstructure. Going beyond our previous works, we determine the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, and chalk out the effects of internode scatterings as well. Our theoretical explorations shed light on the mechanisms of transport in multifold semimetals, which are being investigated in contemporary experiments.</description>

Abstract: Cryo-computing - both classical and quantum, is severely limited by the absence of a suitable cryo-memory. The challenge both in terms of energy efficiency and speed have been known for decades, but so far conventional technologies have not been able to deliver adequate performance. Here we present a novel non-volatile memory device which incorporates a superconducting nanowire and an all-electronic charge configuration memristor (CCM) based on switching between charge-ordered states in a layered dichalcogenide material. We investigate the time-dynamics and current-voltage characteristics of such a device fabricated using a NbTiN nanowire and a 1T-TaS2 CCM. The observed dynamical response of the device is faithfully reproduced by modelling of the superconducting order parameter showing versatility of application. The inherent ultrahigh energy efficiency and speed of the device, which is compatible with single flux quantum logic, leads to a promising new memory concept for use in cryo-computing and quantum computing peripheral devices.</description>

      <title>Wavelet correlation noise analysis for qubit operation variable time series</title>

Abstract: In quantum computing, characterizing the full noise profile of qubits can aid in increasing coherence times and fidelities by developing error-mitigating techniques specific to the noise present. This characterization also supports efforts in advancing device fabrication to remove sources of noise. Qubit properties can be subject to non-trivial correlations in space and time, for example, spin qubits in MOS quantum dots are exposed to noise originating from the complex glassy behavior of two-level fluctuator ensembles. Engineering progress in spin qubit experiments generates large amounts of data, necessitating analysis techniques from fields experienced in managing large data sets. Fields such as astrophysics, finance, and climate science use wavelet-based methods to enhance their data analysis. Here, we propose and demonstrate wavelet-based analysis techniques to decompose signals into frequency and time components, enhancing our understanding of noise sources in qubit systems by identifying features at specific times. We apply the analysis to a state-of-the-art two-qubit experiment in a pair of SiMOS quantum dots with feedback applied to relevant operation variables. The observed correlations serve to identify common microscopic causes of noise, such as two-level fluctuators and hyperfine coupled nuclei, as well as to elucidate pathways for multi-qubit operation with more scalable feedback systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluid helium-3 in the quasi-two-dimensional limit</title>

Abstract: Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors the chiral A phase of the superfluid $^3$He over the time-reversal invariant B phase. Confining the superfluid $^3$He into a cavity of height $D$ of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length $\xi_0$ - ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar) - extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures $P$ and temperatures $T$ where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this Letter, the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid $^4$He film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full $P$-$T$ phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit $D / \xi_0 = 1$ , where $D = 80$ nm. The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully gapped two-dimensional $p_x + ip_y$ superfluid under more extreme confinement.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Local-Resonance Induced Complex Band Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complex band hybridization induced by nonreciprocal local resonances in photonic crystals. Composed of trimer unit cells, a two-dimensional (2D) magnetophotonic crystal with an analytically obtainable solution is considered. We find that nonreciprocal spectral gap may appear without nonreciprocal transmission and that the imaginary parts of the complex wavevectors $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ may blow up at resonance to give extreme nonreciprocal transmission. We further show that, for a subwavelegnth lattice, the isolation ratio for the nonreciprocal transmission is determined solely by $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ instead of the extensively studied real part $\text{Re}(\mathbf{k})$. Our finding contradicts the common belief that "spectral nonreciprocity [$\omega(\mathbf{k})\neq\omega(-\mathbf{k})$] always implies nonreciprocal transmission".</description>

      <title>Axionic quantum criticality of generalized Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a field-theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting nodal semimetals, featuring dispersion that scales with the linear and $n$th power of momentum along $d_L$ and $d_M$ mutually orthogonal directions around a few isolated points in the reciprocal space, respectively, with $d_L+d_M=d$, and residing at the brink of isotropic insulation, described by $N_b$-component bosonic order parameter fields. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a ``small" parameter $\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of identical fermion copies (flavor number) when in conjunction $d_L=1$. When applied to three-dimensional interacting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the Abelian monopole charge $n&gt;1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation ($N_b=2$), a leading-order RG analysis suggests the Gaussian nature of the underlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume mean-field values. A traditional field-theoretic RG analysis yields the same outcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$). Consequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic corrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.</description>

      <title>Hybrid interfaces at the single quantum level in fluorescent molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.</description>

      <title>JAX-BTE: A GPU-Accelerated Differentiable Solver for Phonon Boltzmann Transport Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces JAX-BTE, a GPU-accelerated, differentiable solver for the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) based on differentiable programming. JAX-BTE enables accurate, efficient and differentiable multiscale thermal modeling by leveraging high-performance GPU computing and automatic differentiation. The solver efficiently addresses the high-dimensional and complex integro-differential nature of the phonon BTE, facilitating both forward simulations and data-augmented inverse simulations through end-to-end optimization. Validation is performed across a range of 1D to 3D simulations, including complex FinFET structures, in both forward and inverse settings, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability. JAX-BTE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BTE solvers in forward simulations and uniquely enables inverse simulations, making it a powerful tool for multiscale thermal analysis and design for semiconductor devices.</description>
