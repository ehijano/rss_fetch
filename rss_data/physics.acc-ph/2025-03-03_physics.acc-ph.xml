      <title>Recent progress in high-temperature superconducting undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of superconducting undulators (SCUs) intended for particle accelerator-based light sources, including synchrotrons and free electron laser (FEL) facilities. Recently, a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) undulator prototype, consisting of staggered-array Re-Ba-Cu-O bulks, achieved an on-axis sinusoidal magnetic field profile with a peak amplitude B$_0$ of 2.1 T and a period length of 10 mm, resulting in a deflection parameter K = 1.96. Such a short period HTS undulator not only enables the generation of higher-energy photons, but also supports the construction of economically feasible and compact FELs with shorter linear accelerators (LINACs). This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the staggered-array bulk HTS undulator as well as other types of HTS undulators. Furthermore, it offers insights into the development of engineering HTS undulator prototypes designed for deployment in synchrotron and free electron laser (FEL) facilities. We conclude by discussing opportunities for and the challenges facing the use of HTS undulators in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Generative machine learning-based 6-dimensional phase space reconstruction using bunch compressors at PAL-XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20654</link>

Abstract: Understanding the distribution of particles in 6-dimensional position-momentum phase space of an accelerated beam is one of the essential tasks of accelerator operations. Conventional beam phase space characterization methods in accelerator facilities, such as longitudinal phase space measurements, require specialized diagnostic elements like radio-frequency transverse deflecting cavities to determine the phase space distribution of particles in a beam. Recently, generative phase space reconstruction (GPSR) techniques have shown orders-of-magnitude speed up in resolving detailed phase distributions from experimental measurements. However, these methods still required the use of specialized diagnostic elements to effectively measure the 6-dimensional phase space distribution of beams. In this work, we show that the same machine learning technique can be used in conjunction with longitudinal bunch compressor elements found in many linear accelerators to resolve the 6-dimensional phase space distribution. We demonstrate in both simulation and experiment at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free Electron Laser facility that the reconstruction technique can accurately resolve detailed, non-linear features of the beam using quadrupole magnet, magnetic chicane, scintillating screen, and linearizer cavity. Additionally, we validate the predictive accuracy of the reconstruction using independent, downstream measurements of the longitudinal and transverse phase space distributions after the bunch compressor of the beamline.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility Study of the GeV-Energy Muon Source Based on HIAF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating a mono-energetic, high-energy muon beam using accelerator facilities can be very attractive for many purposes, for example, improving muon tomography currently limited by the low flux and wide energy spread of cosmic ray muons, and searching for muon related new physics beyond the Standard Model. One potential accelerator facility is the High Intensity Heavy-Ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF), which is currently under construction in Huizhou City, China. Considering the projectile energy and beamline length, a high-intensity and GeV-energy muon flux could be produced and delivered by the High Energy Fragment Separator beamline of the HIAF facility. In this paper, the flux intensity and purity of muon beam based on HIAF are discussed in detail. For the $\mu^+$ beam, the highest muon yield reaches $8.2 \times 10^6 ~ \mu$/s with the purity of approximately $2\%$ at a momentum of 3.5 GeV/c; meanwhile, for the $\mu^-$ beam, the maximum muon yield is 4.2 $\times 10^6 ~ \mu$/s with the purity of around $20\%$ at a momentum of 1.5 GeV/c. The results also indicate that, for muon beams with an energy of several GeV, by applying a suitable purification strategy, we can get a muon beam with a purity of 100\% and an intensity of the order of $10^5 ~ \mu$/s.</description>
