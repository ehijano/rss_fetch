      <title>Testing Exclusion and Shape Restrictions in Potential Outcomes Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exclusion and shape restrictions play a central role in defining causal effects and interpreting estimates in potential outcomes models. To date, the testable implications of such restrictions have been studied on a case-by-case basis in a limited set of models. In this paper, we develop a general framework for characterizing sharp testable implications of general support restrictions on the potential response functions, based on a novel graph-based representation of the model. The framework provides a unified and constructive method for deriving all observable implications of the modeling assumptions. We illustrate the approach in several popular settings, including instrumental variables, treatment selection, mediation, and interference. As an empirical application, we revisit the US Lung Health Study and test for the presence of spillovers between spouses, specification of exposure maps, and persistence of treatment effects over time.</description>

      <title>Welfare at Risk: Distributional impact of policy interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framewrok for analyzing how the welfare effects of policy interventions are distributed across individuals when those effects are unobserved. Rather than focusing solely on average outcomes, the approach uses readily available information on average welfare responses to uncover meaningful patterns in how gains and losses are distributed across different populations. The framework is built around the concept of superquantile and applies to a broad class of models with unobserved individual heterogeneity. It enables policymakers to identify which groups are most adversely affected by a policy and to evaluate trade-offs between efficiency and equity. We illustrate the approach in three widely studied economic settings: price changes and compensated variation, treatment allocation with self-selection, and the cost-benefit analysis of social programs. In this latter application, we show how standard tools from the marginal treatment effect and generalized Roy model literature are useful for implementing our bounds for both the overall population and for individuals who participate in the program.</description>

      <title>Learning the Macroeconomic Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), seemingly inapplicable to the small samples typical of macroeconomics, can be trained to learn the language of macroeconomy. We estimate a large-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model on an initial segment of the data and obtain a posterior distribution over structural parameters. We sample from this posterior to generate millions of theory-consistent synthetic panels that, when mixed with actual macroeconomic data, form the training corpus for a time-series transformer with attention. The trained model is then used to forecast out-of-sample through 2025. The results show that this hybrid forecaster, which combines the theoretical coherence of DSGE models with the representational power of modern LLMs, successfully learns the macroeconomic language.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences in the Presence of Unknown Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stable unit treatment value (SUTVA) is a crucial assumption in the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) research design. It rules out hidden versions of treatment and any sort of interference and spillover effects across units. Even if this is a strong assumption, it has not received much attention from DiD practitioners and, in many cases, it is not even explicitly stated as an assumption, especially the no-interference assumption. In this technical note, we investigate what the DiD estimand identifies in the presence of unknown interference. We show that the DiD estimand identifies a contrast of causal effects, but it is not informative on any of these causal effects separately, without invoking further assumptions. Then, we explore different sets of assumptions under which the DiD estimand becomes informative about specific causal effects. We illustrate these results by revisiting the seminal paper on minimum wages and employment by Card and Krueger (1994).</description>

      <title>LLM Personas as a Substitute for Field Experiments in Method Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.</description>

      <title>Estimating Nonseparable Selection Models: A Functional Contraction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for estimating nonseparable selection models. We show that, for a given selection function, the potential outcome distributions are nonparametrically identified from the selected outcome distributions and can be recovered using a simple iterative algorithm based on a contraction mapping. This result enables a full-information approach to estimating selection models without imposing parametric or separability assumptions on the outcome equation. We propose a two-step estimation strategy for the potential outcome distributions and the parameters of the selection function and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our approach performs well in finite samples. The method is applicable to a wide range of empirical settings, including consumer demand models with only transaction prices, auctions with incomplete bid data, and Roy models with data on accepted wages.</description>
