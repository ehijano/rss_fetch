      <title>Directional Electrical Spiking, Bursting, and Information Propagation in Oyster Mycelium Recorded with a Star-Shaped Electrode Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical activity in fungal mycelium has been reported in numerous species and experimental contexts, yet its spatial organisation and propagation remain insufficiently characterised. In this study we investigate the spatiotemporal structure of electrical potential dynamics in oyster mushroom (\textit{Pleurotus ostreatus}) mycelium colonising a wood-shavings substrate. Electrical signals were recorded using an eight-channel star-shaped differential electrode array providing angular resolution around a central region of colonised substrate. We analyse spike statistics, bursting behaviour, inter-channel correlations, and event-based propagation delays. The results reveal strong directional heterogeneity in spiking frequency and amplitude, clustered bursting dynamics, partial and localised coupling between channels, and reproducible propagation patterns across spatial sectors. Electrical bursts originate preferentially in specific directions and recruit other regions with with characteristic delays ranging from seconds to minutes to hours. These findings support the interpretation of fungal mycelium as a spatially extended excitable medium capable of slow, distributed electrical signalling and signal integration.</description>

      <title>Data Product MCP: Chat with your Enterprise Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational data governance aims to make the enforcement of governance policies and legal obligations more efficient and reliable. Recent advances in natural language processing and agentic AI offer ways to improve how organizations share and use data. But many barriers remain. Today's tools require technical skills and multiple roles to discover, request, and query data. Automating data access using enterprise AI agents is limited by the means to discover and autonomously access distributed data. Current solutions either compromise governance or break agentic workflows through manual approvals. To close this gap, we introduce Data Product MCP integrated in a data product marketplace. This data marketplace, already in use at large enterprises, enables AI agents to find, request, and query enterprise data products while enforcing data contracts in real time without lowering governance standards. The system is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and links the AI-driven marketplace with cloud platforms such as Snowflake, Databricks, and Google Cloud Platform. It supports semantic discovery of data products based on business context, automates access control by validating generated queries against approved business purposes using AI-driven checks, and enforces contracts in real time by blocking unauthorized queries before they run. We assessed the system with feedback from $n=16$ experts in data governance. Our qualitative evaluation demonstrates effectiveness through enterprise scenarios such as customer analytics. The findings suggest that Data Product MCP reduces the technical burden for data analysis without weakening governance, filling a key gap in enterprise AI adoption.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction: Implementing Hamming-Based Codes with Advanced Syndrome Extraction Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building reliable quantum computers requires protecting fragile quantum states from inevitable environmental noise and operational errors. While quantum error correction codes like the Steane $[\![7,1,3]\!]$ code provide elegant theoretical solutions, their practical success hinges critically on how we measure errors - a process called syndrome extraction. The challenge lies in the ancilla qubits used for measurement: when they fail, errors can cascade across the entire quantum system, destroying the very information we're trying to protect. We address this fundamental problem by implementing and comparing three sophisticated syndrome measurement strategies: Shor's cat-state approach, which distributes measurements across multiple entangled ancillas achieving 85-92% preparation success; Steane's encoded-ancilla method using complete error-corrected logical qubits reaching 97.8% syndrome fidelity; and a flexible unified framework that adapts strategies based on hardware capabilities. Through extensive simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform spanning randomized benchmarking and T-heavy circuits, we demonstrate that intelligent ancilla management improves error suppression by up to 2.4$\times$ compared to standard approaches. Our implementations achieve logical error rates as low as $5.1 \times 10^{-5}$ under realistic noise conditions with physical error rates of $10^{-3}$, while maintaining near-unity logical fidelity (0.99997) even for deep circuits. The threshold analysis reveals robust performance across distance-3 to distance-13 codes with characteristic threshold curves showing exponential error suppression below the critical physical error rate. These results provide immediately deployable tools for near-term quantum devices and establish practical design principles for scaling toward fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Precision and Recursion for Accelerating Symmetric Linear Solves on MXUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric linear solves are fundamental to a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, from climate modeling and structural analysis to machine learning and optimization. These workloads often rely on Cholesky (POTRF) decomposition and its supporting operations, triangular solves (TRSM) and symmetric rank-k updates (SYRK), which together form the computational core for solving symmetric positive-definite systems. To accelerate these kernels, we present a portable, mixed-precision solver designed for Matrix Processing Units (MXUs), including NVIDIA Tensor Cores (H200) and AMD Matrix Cores (MI300X). Our algorithm builds on a nested recursive formulation in which Cholesky exposes parallelism through recursive decomposition of its TRSM and SYRK sub-problems. This structure yields a hierarchical recursion that maximizes GEMM throughput while enabling fine-grained control over numerical precision. We introduce a custom recursive data structure that assigns low-precision FP16 arithmetic to large off-diagonal blocks, while preserving high precision on diagonal blocks to ensure numerical stability. The solver is implemented in Julia, leveraging array programming, multiple dispatch, and dynamic type inference to enable seamless expression of mixed-precision computation. This design provides a high-level, hardware-agnostic interface while efficiently interfacing with low-level vendor libraries for backend portability. On H200, our recursive FP64 SYRK achieves a 14x speedup over cuBLAS, while mixed-precision delivers up to 27x speedup in SYRK and 5x in TRSM over full-precision baselines. This results in a 5x overall speedup for Cholesky versus cuSOLVER FP64, with 100x better accuracy than pure FP16 while retaining 88% of its peak speedup. Comparable performance and accuracy trends are observed on MI300X, demonstrating broad applicability across GPUs.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Discrimination Enhanced by FPGA-Based AI Engine Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the state of a quantum bit (qubit), known as quantum state discrimination, is a crucial operation in quantum computing. However, it has been the most error-prone and time-consuming operation on superconducting quantum processors. Due to stringent timing constraints and algorithmic complexity, most qubit state discrimination methods are executed offline. In this work, we present an enhanced real-time quantum state discrimination system leveraging FPGA-based AI Engine technology. A multi-layer neural network has been developed and implemented on the AMD Xilinx VCK190 FPGA platform, enabling accurate in-situ state discrimination and supporting mid-circuit measurement experiments for multiple qubits. Our approach leverages recent advancements in architecture research and design, utilizing specialized AI/ML accelerators to optimize quantum experiments and reduce the use of FPGA resources.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing -- Strategic Recommendations for the Industry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This whitepaper surveys the current landscape and short- to mid-term prospects for quantum-enabled optimization and machine learning use cases in industrial settings. Grounded in the QCHALLenge program, it synthesizes hardware trajectories from different quantum architectures and providers, and assesses their maturity and potential for real-world use cases under a standardized traffic-light evaluation framework. We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future). The resulting verdicts illuminate where quantum approaches currently offer promise, where hybrid classical-quantum strategies are most viable, and where classical methods are expected to remain superior.</description>

      <title>Analog fast Fourier transforms for scalable and efficient signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge devices are being deployed at increasing volumes to sense and act on information from the physical world. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is often necessary to make this sensed data suitable for further processing -- such as by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms -- and for transmission over communication networks. Analog in-memory computing has been shown to be a fast, energy-efficient, and scalable solution for processing edge AI workloads, but not for Fourier transforms. This is because of the existence of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which enormously reduces the complexity of the DFT but has so far belonged only to digital processors. Here, we show that the FFT can be mapped to analog in-memory computing systems, enabling them to efficiently scale to arbitrarily large Fourier transforms without requiring large sizes or large numbers of non-volatile memory arrays. We experimentally demonstrate analog FFTs on 1D audio and 2D image signals, performing analog computations on up to 524K charge-trapping memory devices simultaneously, where each device has precisely tunable, low-conductance analog states. The scalability of both the new analog FFT approach and the charge-trapping memory device is leveraged to compute a 65,536-point analog DFT, a scale that is otherwise inaccessible by analog systems and which is $&gt;$500$\times$ larger than any previous analog DFT demonstration. Analog FFT cores can provide higher energy efficiency and performance per area than specialized digital FFT processors at all FFT sizes, while also functioning as efficient matrix multiplication engines for AI workloads.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Control of Resistance Switching Transitions in First-Order Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval, or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval. The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices, resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community, is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic community and industry.</description>

      <title>Sneak Path Current Modeling in Memristor Crossbar Arrays for Analog In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memristor crossbar arrays have emerged as a key component for next-generation non-volatile memories, artificial neural networks, and analog in-memory computing (IMC) systems. By minimizing data transfer between the processor and memory, they offer substantial energy savings. However, a major design challenge in memristor crossbar arrays is the presence of sneak path currents, which degrade electrical performance, reduce noise margins, and limit reliable operations. This work presents a closed-form analytical framework based on IMEC A14 (1.4 nm) Technology for accurately estimating sneak path currents in memristor crossbar arrays. The proposed model captures the interdependence of key design parameters in memristor crossbar arrays, including array size, ON/OFF ratio of memristors, read voltage, and interconnect conditions, through mathematically derived relationships. It supports various practical configurations, such as different data patterns and connection strategies, enabling rapid and comprehensive sneak path current modeling. The sensitivity analysis includes how design parameters influence sneak path current and noise margin loss, underscoring the trade-offs involved in scaling crossbar arrays. Validation through SPICE simulations shows that the model achieves an error of less than 10.9% while being up to 4784 times faster than full circuit simulations. This analytical framework offers a powerful tool for quantitative assessment and pre-design/real-time optimization of memristor-based analog in-memory computing (IMC) architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimizing compilation of error correction codes for 2xN quantum dot arrays and its NP-hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error-correction codes, which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. It is therefore timely to explore error correction architectures consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. Upon such an architecture, we develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a reduced number of shuttling operations. We demonstrate how column-regular qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that is exactly equal to the column weight of the code when Shor-style syndrome extraction is used. We provide tables stating the number of required shuttles for many contemporary codes of interest. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for general codes, even when using Shor syndrome extraction. We also discuss how one could get around this by placing blanks in the ancilla array to achieve minimal shuttles with Shor syndrome extraction on any CSS code, at the cost of longer ancilla arrays.</description>

      <title>H3PIMAP: A Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Objective DNN Mapping Framework on Electronic-Photonic Processing-in-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The future of artificial intelligence (AI) acceleration demands a paradigm shift beyond the limitations of purely electronic or photonic architectures. Photonic analog computing delivers unmatched speed and parallelism but struggles with data movement, robustness, and precision, while electronic processing-in-memory (PIM) enables energy-efficient computing by co-locating storage and computation but suffers from endurance and reconfiguration constraints, limiting it to static weight mapping. Neither approach alone achieves the balance needed for adaptive, efficient AI. To break this impasse, we study a hybrid electronic-photonic-PIM computing architecture and introduce H3PIMAP, a heterogeneity-aware mapping framework that seamlessly orchestrates workloads across electronic and optical tiers. By optimizing workload partitioning through a two-stage multi-objective exploration method, H3PIMAP harnesses light speed for high-throughput operations and PIM efficiency for memory-bound tasks. In system-level evaluations, H3PIMAP delivers a 3.32x latency reduction across language and vision models and, on large language models, achieves 77.0% lower latency with 14.6% lower energy at matched quality, outperforming homogeneous and naive mapping strategies. This proposed framework lays the foundation for hybrid AI accelerators, bridging the gap between electronic and photonic computation for next-generation efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Minimizing energy dissipation during programming of resistive switching memory devices using their dynamical attractor states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under certain conditions, applying a sequence of voltage pulses of alternating polarities across a resistive switching memory device induces a finite number of fixed-point attractors in its time-averaged dynamics, known as dynamical attractors. Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly regarding the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. The proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor (VTEAM) model, which is known for its predictive capability and adaptability in fitting a large number of resistive switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges in Executing Shor's Algorithm on Existing Quantum Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.</description>
