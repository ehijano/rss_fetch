      <title>The Dyer-Lashof algebra in bordism (extended abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of Dyer-Lashof operations in unoriented bordism (the canonical splitting $N_*(X)\simeq N_*\otimes H_*(X)$, where $N_*( )$ is unoriented bordism and $H_*( )$ is homology mod 2, does not respect these operations). For any finite covering space we define a ``polynomial functor'' from the category of topological spaces to itself. If the covering space is a closed manifold we obtain an operation defined on the bordism of any $E_\infty$-space. A certain sequence of operations called squaring operations are defined from two-fold coverings; they satisfy the Cartan formula and also a generalization of the Adem relations that is formulated by using Lubin's theory of isogenies of formal group laws. We call a ring equipped with such a sequence of squaring operations a D-ring, and observe that the bordism ring of any free $E_\infty$-space is free as a D-ring. In particular, the bordism ring of finite covering manifolds is the free D-ring on one generator. In a second compte-rendu we discuss the (Nishida) relations between the Landweber-Novikov and the Dyer-Lashof operations, and show how to represent the Dyer-Lashof operations in terms of their actions on the characteristic numbers of manifolds.</description>

      <title>Weiss derivatives of holomorphic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an orthogonal approach to the stable homotopy type of spaces of holomorphic maps to projective space. We study the Weiss towers of the unitary functors of holomorphic and continuous maps to $\mathbb{P}(V)$, and show that the former is polynomial and completely compute the latter. As an application we give a new proof of a stable splitting of Cohen--Cohen--Mann--Milgram.</description>

      <title>On the local constancy of regularized superdeterminants along special families of differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the flat-regularized determinant of families of operators of the form $D_\tau=[\delta_\tau,d_\nabla]$, where $\tau\to\delta_\tau$ are families of degree $-1$ maps in the twisted de Rham complex $\left(\Omega^\bullet(M,E),d_\nabla\right)$ generalizing the (twisted) Hodge codifferential. We show that under suitable assumptions, both geometrical and analytical in nature, the flat-regularized determinant of $D_\tau$, restricted to the subspace $\mathrm{im}(\delta_\tau)$, is constant in $\tau$. The general result we present implies both local constancy of the Ray--Singer torsion and of the value at zero of the Ruelle zeta function for a contact Anosov flow, upon choosing $\delta_\tau = \delta_{g_\tau}$, the Hodge codifferential for a family of metrics, and $\delta_\tau=\iota_{X_\tau}$, the contraction along a family of (regular, contact) Anosov vector fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>Partial parametrized presentability and the universal property of equivariant spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of partial presentability in parametrized higher category theory and investigate its interaction with the concepts of parametrized semiadditivity and stability from arXiv:2301.08240. In particular, we construct the free partially presentable $T$-categories in the unstable, semiadditive, and stable contexts and explain how to exhibit them as full subcategories of their fully presentable analogues.
  Specializing our results to the setting of (global) equivariant homotopy theory, we obtain a notion of equivariant presentability for the global categories of arXiv:2301.08240, and we show that the global category of genuine equivariant spectra is the free global category that is both equivariantly presentable and equivariantly stable. As a consequence, we deduce the analogous result about the $G$-category of genuine $G$-spectra for any finite group $G$, previously formulated by Nardin.</description>

      <title>Cohomotopy Sets of $(n-1)$-connected $(2n+2)$-manifolds for small $n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed orientable $(n-1)$-connected $(2n+2)$-manifold, $n\geq 2$. In this paper we combine the Postnikov tower of spheres and the homotopy decomposition of the reduced suspension space $\Sigma M$ to investigate the cohomotopy sets $\pi^\ast(M)$ for $n=2,3,4$, under the assumption that $M$ has $2$-torsion-free homology. All cohomotopy sets $\pi^i(M)$ of such manifolds $M$ are characterized except $\pi^4(M)$ for $n=3,4$.</description>

      <title>Sheaves of modules on atomic sites and discrete representations of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish close relations among sheaves of modules on atomic sites, representations of categories, and discrete representations of topological groups. We characterize sheaves of modules on atomic sites as saturated representations, which are precisely representations right perpendicular to torsion representations in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing. Consequently, the category of sheaves is equivalent to the Serre quotient of the category of presheaves by the category of torsion presheaves. We also interpret the sheaf cohomology functors as derived functors of the torsion functor and for some special cases as the local cohomology functors. These results as well as a classical theorem of Artin provides us a new approach to study discrete representations of topological groups. In particular, by importing established facts in representation stability theory, we explicitly classify simple or indecomposable injective discrete representations of some topological groups such as the infinite symmetric group, the infinite general or special linear group over a finite field, and the automorphism group of the linearly ordered set $\mathbb{Q}$. We also show that discrete representations $V$ of these topological groups satisfy a certain stability property.</description>
