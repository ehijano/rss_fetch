      <title>Phase transitions in $q$-state clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $q-$state clock model, sometimes called the discrete $XY$ model, shows interesting critical phenomena. While $q=2$ corresponds to the Ising model, the $q\to\infty$ limit corresponds to the well-known $XY$ model. It is known that up to $q=4$, the two-dimensional (2D) clock model exhibits a symmetry-breaking phase transition. On the other hand, the 2D $XY$ model only shows a topological (Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless or BKT) phase transition. Interestingly, the model with finite $q$ (with $q\ge 5$) is predicted to show two different phase transitions. There are varying opinions about the actual characters of the transitions, especially the one at the lower temperature. In this work we develop mean-field theory (basic and higher order) to study the $q$-state clock model systematically. Using the mean-field theory, we show that the phase transition at the higher temperature is of the BKT type. We find that this transition temperature ($T_{BKT}$) does not depend on the $q$ values, and our basic (zeroth order) mean-field calculation shows that $T_{BKT} = 2J/k_B$, where $J$ is the nearest-neighbor exchange constant and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Our analysis shows that the other phase transition is a spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) type. The corresponding transition temperature ($T_{SSB}$) is found to decrease with increasing $q$ value; it is found that $T_{SSB} \propto 1/q^2$ with a weak logarithmic correction. To better understand the model, we also perform the first-order mean-field calculations (here, the interaction between two targeted nearest neighbors is treated exactly). This calculation gives us $T_{BKT} = 1.895J/k_B$, which is slightly closer to the reported value of $0.893J/k_B$. The main advantage of this higher-order mean-field theory is that one can now estimate the spin-spin correlation, whose change in the properties indicates the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits on nonequilibrium sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of equilibrium sensors is restricted by the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. We here investigate the physical limits on nonequilibrium sensing in bipartite systems with nonreciprocal coupling. We show that one of the subsystems, acting as a Maxwell's demon, can significantly suppress the fluctuations of the other subsystem relative to its response to an external perturbation. Such negative violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation can considerably improve the signal-to-noise ratio above its corresponding equilibrium value, allowing the subsystem to operate as an enhanced sensor. We find that the nonequilibrium signal-to-noise ratio of linear systems may be arbitrary large at low frequencies, even at a fixed overall amount of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Disorder driven topological phase transitions in 1D mechanical quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the transition from trivial to non-trivial phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model subjected to disorder in a quasi-periodic environment. We analytically determine the phase boundary, and characterize the localization of normal modes using their inverse participation ratio. We compute energy-dependent mobility edges and provide evidence for the emergence of a topological Anderson insulator within specific parameter ranges. Whereas the phase transition boundary is affected by the quasi-periodic modulation, the topologically insulating Anderson phase is stable with respect to the chiral disorder in a quasi-periodic setup. Additionally, our results also uncover a re-entrant topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial phases for certain values of quasi-periodic modulation with fixed chiral disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibilities of application of such boundary functionals of random processes as extreme values of these processes, the moment of first reaching a fixed level, the value of the process at the moment of reaching the level, the moment of reaching extreme values, the time of the process staying above a fixed level, and other functionals to the description of physical, chemical and biological problems are considered. Definitions of these functionals are given and characteristic functions of these functionals are written for the model of exponential distribution of incoming demands. The possibilities of using boundary functionals are demonstrated using examples of a unicyclic network with affinity A, an asymmetric random walk, nonlinear diffusion and multiple diffusing particles with reversible target-binding kinetics.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in Non-reciprocal Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How is the irreversibility of a high-dimensional chaotic system controlled by the heterogeneity in the non-reciprocal interactions among its elements? In this paper, we address this question using a stochastic model of random recurrent neural networks that undergoes a transition from quiescence to chaos at a critical heterogeneity. In the thermodynamic limit, using dynamical mean field theory, we obtain an exact expression for the averaged entropy production rate - a measure of irreversibility - for any heterogeneity level J. We show how this quantity becomes a constant at the onset of chaos while changing its functional form upon crossing this point. The latter can be elucidated by closed-form approximations valid for below and slightly above the critical point and for large J.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Difference Fluctuations in Short-Range Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed (but not yet proved) that Ising spin glasses with nearest-neighbor interactions have a phase transition in three and higher dimensions to a low-temperature spin glass phase, but the nature of this phase remains controversial, especially whether it is characterized by multiple incongruent Gibbs states. Of particular relevance to this question is the behavior of the typical free energy difference restricted to a finite volume between two such putative Gibbs states, as well as the nature of the fluctuations of their free energy difference as the couplings within the volume vary. In this paper we investigate these free energy difference fluctuations by introducing a new kind of metastate which classifies Gibbs states through their edge overlap values with a reference Gibbs state randomly chosen from the support of the periodic boundary condition (PBC) metastate. We find that the free energy difference between any two incongruent pure states, regardless of the details of how they're organized into mixed states within the PBC metastate, converges to a Gaussian (or Gaussian-like) distribution whose variance scales with the volume, proving a decades-old conjecture of Fisher and Huse. The same conclusion applies, though with some additional restrictions, to both mixed Gibbs states and ground states. We discuss some implications of these results.</description>

      <title>Entangling power, gate typicality and Measurement-induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Extracting the symmetries of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We study a model of networked atoms or molecules oscillating around their equilibrium positions. The model assumes the harmonic approximation of the interactions. We provide bounds for the total number of phonons, and for the specific heat, in terms of the average Wiener capacity, or resistance, of the network. Thanks to such bounds, we can distinguish qualitatively different behaviours in terms of the network structure alone.</description>

      <title>Fractals and spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes: a perspective from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional spin-$s$ ${\rm SU}(2)$ ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, as a paradigmatic example for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) with type-B Goldstone modes (GMs), is expected to exhibit an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace. This intrinsic abstract fractal is here revealed from a systematic investigation into the entanglement entropy for a linear combination of factorized (unentangled) ground states on a fractal decomposable into a set of the Cantor sets. The entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size, with the prefactor being half the fractal dimension of a fractal, as long as the norm for the linear combination scales as the square root of the number of the self-similar building blocks kept at each step $k$ for a fractal, under an assumption that the maximum absolute value of the coefficients in the linear combination is chosen to be around one, and the coefficients in the linear combination are almost constants within the building blocks. Actually, the set of the fractal dimensions for all the Cantor sets forms a {\it dense} subset in the interval $[0,1]$. As a consequence, the ground state subspace is separated into a disjoint union of countably infinitely many regions, each of which is labeled by a decomposable fractal. Hence, the interpretation of the prefactor as half the fractal dimension is valid for any support beyond a fractal, which in turn leads to the identification of the fractal dimension with the number of type-B GMs for the orthonormal basis states. Our argument may be extended to any quantum many-body systems undergoing SSB with type-B GMs.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian structure of the eigenvector overlap for the symplectic Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of Transport through Evolving Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insight into the blockage vulnerability of evolving spatial networks is important for understanding transport resilience, robustness, and failure of a broad class of real-world structures such as porous media and utility, urban traffic, and infrastructure networks. By exhaustive search for central transport hubs on porous lattice structures, we recursively determine and block the emerging main hub until the evolving network reaches the impenetrability limit. We find that the blockage backbone is a self-similar path with a fractal dimension which is distinctly smaller than that of the universality class of optimal path crack models. The number of blocking steps versus the rescaled initial occupation fraction collapses onto a master curve for different network sizes, allowing for the prediction of the onset of impenetrability. The shortest-path length distribution broadens during the blocking process reflecting an increase of spatial correlations. We address the reliability of our predictions upon increasing the disorder or decreasing the fraction of processed structural information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing video microscopy, we explore the cage dynamics for colloidal particles confined in quasi-two dimensions (q2D). Our experiments reveal that while ensemble-averaged dynamics of cages are isotropic in the laboratory frame, its evolution in the displacement frame of the caged particle is anisotropic and asymmetric. In turn, this leads to particles in specific regions of the cage contributing either to cage persistence or breaking, influencing the structural relaxation of the fluid. Our findings, thus, provide microscopic insights into cage evolution and dynamics for colloidal fluids in q2D, with direct potential implications for the flow of complex fluids, structural relaxation in dense suspensions, and collective motion in active matter in confined geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) is a walk on a graph that is directed, does not visit the same vertex twice, and has a trapped endpoint. We show that the generating function enumerating GSAWs on a half-infinite strip of finite height is rational, and we give a procedure to construct a combinatorial finite state machine that allows one to compute this generating function. We then modify this procedure to compute generating functions for GSAWs under two probabilistic models. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected length and displacement for GSAWs on the quarter plane, half plane, full plane, and half-infinite strips of bounded height for which we cannot compute the generating function. Finally, we prove that the generating functions for Greek key tours (GSAWs on a finite grid that visit every vertex) on a half-infinite strip of fixed height are also rational, allowing us to resolve several conjectures.</description>

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated assemblies where building blocks misfit have been shown to generate intriguing phenomena from self-limited growth, fiber formation, to structural complexity. We introduce a graph theory formulation of geometrically frustrated assemblies, capturing frustrated interactions through the concept of incompatible flows, providing a direct link between structural connectivity and frustration. This theory offers a minimal yet comprehensive framework for the fundamental statistical mechanics of frustrated assemblies. Through numerical simulations, the theory reveals new characteristics of frustrated assemblies, including two distinct percolation transitions for structure and stress, a crossover between cumulative and non-cumulative frustration controlled by disorder, and a divergent length scale in their response.</description>

In this brief report, by combining the formalism used in the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, we have explained some aspects of negative temperature ( both mathematically and graphically ) in the two level system. We believe that these simple calculations may give useful and concrete insights about the negative absolute temperature to the undergraduate students.</description>

      <title>Power-law relaxation of a confined diffusing particle subject to resetting with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at late times toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.</description>

      <title>The Ground State of the S=1 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain is Topologically Nontrivial if Gapped</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional $S=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10729v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The familiar second derivative test for convexity, combined with resolvent calculus, is shown to yield a useful tool for the study of convex matrix-valued functions. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on a number of theorems in this field. These include convexity principles which play an essential role in the Lieb-Ruskai proof of the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning of Continuous Data by Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond their origin in modeling many-body quantum systems, tensor networks have emerged as a promising class of models for solving machine learning problems, notably in unsupervised generative learning. While possessing many desirable features arising from their quantum-inspired nature, tensor network generative models have previously been largely restricted to binary or categorical data, limiting their utility in real-world modeling problems. We overcome this by introducing a new family of tensor network generative models for continuous data, which are capable of learning from distributions containing continuous random variables. We develop our method in the setting of matrix product states, first deriving a universal expressivity theorem proving the ability of this model family to approximate any reasonably smooth probability density function with arbitrary precision. We then benchmark the performance of this model on several synthetic and real-world datasets, finding that the model learns and generalizes well on distributions of continuous and discrete variables. We develop methods for modeling different data domains, and introduce a trainable compression layer which is found to increase model performance given limited memory or computational resources. Overall, our methods give important theoretical and empirical evidence of the efficacy of quantum-inspired methods for the rapidly growing field of generative learning.</description>

      <title>A principle of maximum ignorance for semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The principle of maximum ignorance posits that the coarse-grained description of a system is maximally agnostic about its underlying microscopic structure. We briefly review this principle for random matrix theory and for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We then apply this principle in holography to construct ensembles of random mixed states. This leads to an ensemble of microstates which models our microscopic ignorance, and which on average reproduces the effective semiclassical physics of a given bulk state. We call this ensemble the state-averaging ansatz. The output of our model is a prediction for semiclassical contributions to variances and higher statistical moments over the ensemble of microstates. The statistical moments provide coarse-grained -- yet gravitationally non-perturbative -- information about the microstructure of the individual states of the ensemble. We show that these contributions exactly match the on-shell action of known wormhole configurations of the gravitational path integral. These results strengthen the view that wormholes simply parametrize the ignorance of the microstructure of a fundamental state, given a fixed semiclassical bulk description.</description>

      <title>Confinement-driven state transition and bistability in schooling fish</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of confinement density (i.e the number of individuals in a group per unit area of available space) on transitions from polarized to milling state, using groups of rummy-nose tetra fish (\textit{Hemigrammus rhodostomus}) under controlled experimental conditions. We demonstrate a continuous state transition controlled by confinement density in a group of live animals. During this transition, the school exhibits a bistable state, wherein both polarization and milling states coexist, with the group randomly alternating between them. A simple two-state Markov process describes the observed transition remarkably well. The confinement density influences the statistics of this bistability, shaping the distribution of transition times between states. Our findings suggest that confinement plays a crucial role in state transitions for moving animal groups. More generally, they provide an experimental benchmark for active matter models of macroscopic, self-propelled, confined agents.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition might be better understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme for investigating arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. Extending the grand canonical ensemble yields any given observable as an explicit hyper-density functional. Associated local fluctuation profiles follow from an exact hyper-Ornstein-Zernike equation. While the local compressibility and simple observables permit analytic treatment, complex order parameters are accessible via simulation-based supervised machine learning of neural hyper-direct correlation functionals. We exemplify efficient and accurate neural predictions for the cluster statistics of hard rods, square well rods, and hard spheres. The theory allows to treat complex observables, as is impossible in standard density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Neural density functionals: Local learning and pair-correlation matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Dijkman et al. (arXiv:2403.15007) proposed training classical neural density functionals via bulk pair-correlation matching. We show their method to be an efficient regularizer for neural functionals based on local learning of inhomogeneous one-body direct correlations [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 120, e2312484120 (2023), 10.1073/pnas.2312484120]. While Dijkman et al. demonstrated pair-correlation matching of a global neural free energy functional, we argue in favor of local one-body learning for flexible neural modelling of the full Mermin-Evans density functional map. Using spatial localization gives access to accurate neural free energy functionals, including convolutional neural networks, that transcend the training box.</description>

      <title>Unitary tetrahedron quantum gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>
