      <title>Elucidating the roles of collision energy and photon momentum transfer in the formation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements of the rotational distribution of $^{84}$Sr and $^{86}$Sr 5sns $^1S_0$ ultralong-range Rydberg molecular dimers created via photoassociation in a cold gas are reported. The dimers are produced by two-photon excitation via the 5s5p $^1P_1$ intermediate state. The use of singlet states permits detailed study of the roles that the initial atom-atom interaction, photon momentum transfer during Rydberg excitation, and sample temperature play in determining the spectral lineshape and final dimer rotational distribution. The results are in good agreement with the predictions of a model that includes these effects. The present work further highlights the sensitivity of ultralong-range Rydberg molecule formation to the state of the initial cold gas.</description>

      <title>Electronic processes in collisions between nitrogen impurity ions and hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to interpret and predict the behavior and properties of fusion plasma, accurate cross sections for electronic processes in collisions between plasma impurities and atomic hydrogen are required. In this work, we investigate the electron capture, target excitation, and ionization processes occurring in collision of ${\rm N}^{4+}$ with atomic hydrogen in a broad energy domain ranging from 0.06 to 225 keV/u. We consider ${\rm N}^{4+}$ ground state ${\rm N}^{4+} (2s)$ and also ${\rm N}^{4+} (2p)$ since the impurities in the edge plasma environment may be excited due to collisions with electrons and ions/atoms. Total and partial cross sections in both spin-averaged and spin-resolved cases are calculated using a two-active-electron semiclassical asymptotic-state close-coupling approach. For electron capture cross sections the present results show the best overall agreement with available experimental data for both total and partial cross sections, and the origins of observed discrepancies are discussed. Furthermore, we provide new data for target excitation and ionization processes, which are essential to improve our understanding of this relevant collision system. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently published a report highlighting the importance and the scarcity of such data. Our work therefore will allow a better modeling and thus understanding of magnetically confined fusion plasma.</description>

      <title>Overtone Transition $2\nu_1$ of $\text{HCO}^+$ and $\text{HOC}^+$: Origin, Radiative Lifetime, Collisional Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectra of the first overtone vibration transition of $\text{C-H}$/$\text{O-H}$ stretch ($2\nu_1$) in $\text{HCO}^+$ and $\text{HOC}^+$, recorded using a laser induced reaction action scheme inside a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency trap. Band origins have been located at 6078.68411(19) and 6360.17630(26) $\text{cm}^{-1}$, respectively. We introduce a technique based on mass selective ejection from the ion trap for recording background free action spectra. Varying the number density of the neutral action scheme reactant ($\text{CO}_2$ and Ar, respectively) and collisional partner reactant inside the ion trap, permitted us to estimate the radiative lifetime of the state to be 1.53(34) and 1.22(34) ms, respectively, and the collisional quenching rates of $\text{HCO}^+$ ($2\nu_1$) with He, H$_2$, and N$_2$.</description>

      <title>Single-photon and multi-photon Fano lines for helium and neon using tRecX-haCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon and multi-photon ionization of helium and neon atoms by ultrashort extreme ultraviolet radiation is studied using the tRecX-haCC package developed by the authors. The tRecX-haCC package solves the time dependent Schrodinger equation in the presence of a laser pulse and computes the photoelectron spectra using the iSurf technique to efficiently capture the slow decay of the resonant states. Wavelength of the radiation is chosen to expose doubly excited states embedded in the continuum. The lineshapes in the spectra that arise as a result of these doubly excited states are analyzed. The computed peak positions and linewidths are in good agreement with the literature. In addition, the dependence of the Fano q parameter on the order of the multi-photon process is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>An optical atomic clock using $4D_J$ states of rubidium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an optical atomic clock using two-photon $5S_{1/2} \rightarrow 4D_J$ transitions in rubidium. Four one- and two-color excitation schemes to probe the fine-structure states $4D_{3/2}$ and $4D_{5/2}$ are considered in detail. We compare key characteristics of Rb $4D_J$ and $5D_{5/2}$ two-photon clocks. The $4D_J$ clock features a high signal-to-noise ratio due to two-photon decay at favorable wavelengths, low dc electric and magnetic susceptibilities, and minimal black-body shifts. Ac Stark shifts from the clock interrogation lasers are compensated by two-color Rabi-frequency matching. We identify a "magic" wavelength near 1060~nm, which allows for in-trap, Doppler-free clock-transition interrogation with lattice-trapped cold atoms. From our analysis of clock statistics and systematics, we project a quantum-noise-limited relative clock stability at the $10^{-13}/\sqrt{\tau(s)}$-level, with integration time $\tau$ in seconds, and a relative accuracy of $\sim 10^{-13}$. We describe a potential architecture for implementing the proposed clock using a single telecom clock laser at 1550~nm, which is conducive to optical communication and long-distance clock comparisons. Our work could be of interest in efforts to realize small and portable Rb clocks and in high-precision measurements of atomic properties of Rb $4D_J$-states.</description>

      <title>All-optically tunable enantio-selectivity and chirality transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and controlling the chirality of materials play an essential role in exploring nature, providing new avenues for material creation, discrimination, and manipulation. In such tasks, chiral reagents are essential in defining or enhancing the chiral dichroism response. However, ignoring their influences on the symmetry of the medium hamper the ability to control and induce asymmetric synthesis. Here, we propose a simple but versatile chirality transfer method for synthesizing and manipulating the chirality of medium. The proposed method induces the dispersion of light in a neutral atomic system, allowing to deterministically and tunably control the chirality transfer using a helical field. First, we theoretically analyze the mechanism for this optically induced chirality transfer. Afterwards, we experimentally study the enantio-sensitive feature of the medium exposed to the auxiliary chiral field. This result can be suppressed or enhanced in a deterministic enantio-selection, opening up an efficient way to manipulate asymmetric synthesis.</description>
