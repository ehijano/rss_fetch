      <title>Design and development of an advanced material for beampipe applications in particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present investigation reports the design and development of an advanced material with a high figure of merit (FoM) for beampipe applications in particle accelerators by bringing synergy between computational and experimental approaches. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the phase(s), low density, and high radiation length of the designed Al-Ti-V alloys. Al-Ti-V alloys with various compositions for single-phase and dual-phase mixtures, liquidus temperature, and density values are obtained using the Latin hypercube sampling method in TC Python Thermo-Calc software. The obtained dataset is utilized to train the machine-learning algorithms. Classification algorithms such as XGBoost and regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest regressor have been used to compute the number of phases, radiation length, and density respectively. The XGBoost algorithms show an accuracy of $98\%$, the Linear regression model shows an accuracy of $94\%$, and the Random Forest regressor model is accurate up to $99\%$. The developed Al-Ti-V alloys exhibit high radiation length as well as a good combination of high elastic modulus and toughness due to the synergistic effect of the presence of hard $Al_3Ti$ phase along with a minor volume fraction of FCC $(Al)_{ss}$ solid solution phase mixture. The comparison of our alloys, alloy-1 ($Al_{75.2}Ti_{22.8}V_{2}$) and alloy-2 ($Al_{89}Ti_{10}V_{1}$) shows an increase in the radiation length by seven-times and a decrease in the density by two to three times as compared to stainless steel 304, the preferred material for constructing beampipes in low-energy particle accelerators. Further, we experimentally verify the elastic modulus of the alloy-1 and compute the FoM equal to 0.416, which is better than other existing materials for beampipes in low-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Steering of Sub-GeV positrons by ultra-thin bent Silicon crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Beam Test Facility of the DA{\Phi}NE accelerator complex at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of INFN, 450 MeV positrons have bean deflected, for the first time at sub-GeV energy, using the Planar Channeling process in a bent silicon crystal. The deflection angle obtained is beyond 1 mrad with an high efficiency of deflection. This interesting result finds several applications for manipulation of this kind of beams, in particular for slow extraction from leptons circular accelerators like DA{\Phi}NE. In this work the experimental apparatus, the measurement procedure and the experimental results are reported.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization Model for Composite Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) model to describe the magnetization and instantaneous power loss of composite superconductors. Once the parameters of the ROHM model are fixed based on reference simulations, it allows to directly compute the macroscopic response of composite superconductors without having to solve for the detailed current density distribution. It can be used as a homogenized model in large-scale superconducting systems in order to significantly reduce the computational work compared to detailed simulations. In this contribution, we focus on the case of a strand with twisted superconducting filaments subject to an external transverse magnetic field. We propose two levels of ROHM models: a rate-independent model that reproduces pure hysteresis without dynamic effects, and a rate-dependent model that generalizes the former by also reproducing dynamic effects observed in superconducting strands due to coupling and eddy currents. We describe the implementation and inclusion of these models in a finite element framework, discuss their parameter identification and finally demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Electron source based on emergence of self-injected electron bunch at plasma wakefield excitation by a TW laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wakefield acceleration methods are known due to some their advantages. The main of them is the high accelerating gradient up to several teravolts per meter. In the paper another important advantage is concluded to the possibility of using a wakefield accelerator as a source of electrons by means of obtaining self injected bunches and their accelera-tion. The result is the simulation of the process of plasma wakefield excitation by a laser pulse with an energy of tens of mJ and a power of 1-2 TW for obtaining the promising electron source. Homogeneous and Gaussian plasma profiles were investigated and compared to increase the energy of the self-injected bunches. The laser parameters were taken that corresponded to the parameters of the laser setup in the Institute of Plasma Electronics and New Methods of Acceleration of the National Scientific Center "Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology". Based on the results of the simulation, the possibility of obtaining relativistic self-injected bunches that can be used for further laser acceler-ation experiments, including dielectric laser acceleration, was demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Relativistic beam loading, recoil-reduction, and residual-wake acceleration with a covariant retarded-potential integrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algorithm is demonstrated that performs first-principles tracking of relativistic charged-particles. A covariant approach is used which relies on retarded vector potentials for trajectory integration instead of performing electromagnetic field calculations. When accounting for retardation effects, the peak vector potential and corresponding Lorentz force in the direction of travel increase asymptotically for high-$\beta$ particles. This produces a very strong field distribution at small angles from the particle's direction of travel, which can result in considerable change in momentum when approaching a conducting surface or another charged particle. We quantify the former effect for protons and electrons at various energies and aperture sizes, where substantial power deposition can be avoided by ensuring that particles do not pass within roughly 10 microns of the aperture surface.
  We also simulate breaking a test particle's line of sight with a conductor or other charged body. After this instant, the test particle continues to accelerate due to residual fields, but no longer produces an opposing force on any charged or conducting object; thus any recoil on the enclosing structure is effectively reduced.
  Resulting acceleration dynamics are characterized using protons and electrons at various energies; with, for example, a 1% energy gain for an 85 MeV electron traversing its reflected wake while approaching a pinhole aperture. We then integrate a micro-scale dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) device into our simulations: compared with a solitary 2 mm DLA, we find a factor of two increase in energy gain when combining the DLA with a series of conducting-surface choppers.</description>

      <title>Optical ionization effects in kHz laser wakefield acceleration with few-cycle pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present significant advances in Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) operating at a 1 kHz repetition rate, employing a sub-TW, few-femtosecond laser and a continuously flowing hydrogen gas target. We conducted the first comprehensive study assessing how the nature of the gas within the target influences accelerator performance. This work confirms and elucidates the superior performance of hydrogen in kHz LWFA. Our system generates quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energies up to 10 MeV, bunch charges of 2 pC, and angular divergences of 15 mrad. Notably, our novel scheme relying on differential pumping enables continuous operation at kHz repetition rates, contrasting with previous systems that operated in burst mode to achieve similar beam properties. Particle-in-cell simulations explain hydrogen's superior performances: the ionization effects in nitrogen and helium distort the laser pulse, negatively impacting accelerator performance. These effects are strongly mitigated in hydrogen plasma, thereby enhancing beam quality. This analysis represents a significant step forward in optimizing and understanding kHz LWFA. It underscores the critical role of hydrogen and the imperative need to develop hydrogen-compatible target systems capable of managing high repetition rates, as exemplified by our differential pumping system. These advances lay the groundwork for further developments in high-repetition-rate LWFA technology.</description>
