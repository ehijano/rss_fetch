      <title>Model-based Design Tool for Cyber-physical Power Systems using SystemC-AMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical power systems, such as grids, integrate computational and communication components with physical systems to introduce novel functions and improve resilience and fault tolerance. These systems employ computational components and real-time controllers to meet power demands. Microgrids, comprising interconnected components, energy resources within defined electrical boundaries, computational elements, and controllers, offer a solution for integrating renewable energy sources and ensuring resilience in electricity demand. Simulating these cyber-physical systems (CPS) is vital for grid design, as it facilitates the modeling and control of both continuous physical processes and discrete-time power converters and controllers. This paper presents a model-based design tool for simulating cyber-physical power systems, including microgrids, using SystemC-AMS. The adoption of SystemC-AMS enables physical modeling with both native components from the SystemC-AMS library and user-defined computational elements. We observe that SystemC-AMS can accurately produce the electromagnetic transient responses essential for analyzing grid stability. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SystemC-AMS through use cases that simulate grid-following inverters. Comparing the SystemC-AMS implementation to one in Simulink reveals that SystemC-AMS offers a more rapid simulation. A design tool like this could support microgrid designers in making informed decisions about the selection of microgrid components prior to installation and deployment.</description>

      <title>CNN-based Compressor Mass Flow Estimator in Industrial Aircraft Vapor Cycle System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Vapor Cycle Systems, the mass flow sensor playsa key role for different monitoring and control purposes. However,physical sensors can be inaccurate, heavy, cumbersome, expensive orhighly sensitive to vibrations, which is especially problematic whenembedded into an aircraft. The conception of a virtual sensor, basedon other standard sensors, is a good alternative. This paper has twomain objectives. Firstly, a data-driven model using a ConvolutionalNeural Network is proposed to estimate the mass flow of thecompressor. We show that it significantly outperforms the standardPolynomial Regression model (thermodynamic maps), in terms of thestandard MSE metric and Engineer Performance metrics. Secondly,a semi-automatic segmentation method is proposed to compute theEngineer Performance metrics for real datasets, as the standard MSEmetric may pose risks in analyzing the dynamic behavior of VaporCycle Systems.</description>

      <title>Best Response Sequences and Tradeoffs in Submodular Resource Allocation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving competitive, distributed solutions to multi-agent problems is crucial for many developing application domains; Game theory has emerged as a useful framework to design such algorithms. However, much of the attention within this framework is on the study of equilibrium behavior, whereas transient behavior is often ignored. Therefore, in this paper we study the transient efficiency guarantees of best response processes in the context of submodular resource allocation games, which find application in various engineering contexts. Specifically the main focus of this paper is on characterizing the optimal short-term system-level behavior under the best-response process. Interestingly, the resulting transient performance guarantees are relatively close to the optimal asymptotic performance guarantees. Furthermore, we characterize the trade-offs that result when optimizing for both asymptotic and transient efficiency through various utility designs.</description>

      <title>Equity-aware Load Shedding Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load shedding is usually the last resort to balance generation and demand to maintain stable operation of the electric grid after major disturbances. Current load-shedding optimization practices focus mainly on the physical optimality of the network power flow. This might lead to an uneven allocation of load curtailment, disadvantaging some loads more than others. Addressing this oversight, this paper introduces an innovative equity-aware load-shedding optimization model that emphasizes a fair allocation of load curtailment across the network. By proposing a novel equity indicator for load shedding and integrating it into an ACOPF-based optimization framework, we offer grid operators a more balanced and equitable load shedding strategy. Case studies highlight the importance of equity considerations in determining optimal load curtailment between buses.</description>

      <title>Delta-V-Optimal Centralized Guidance Strategy For Under-actuated N-Satellite Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the computation of Delta-V-optimal, safe, relative orbit reconfigurations for satellite formations in a centralized fashion. The formations under consideration comprise an uncontrolled chief spacecraft flying with an arbitrary number, N, of deputy satellites, where each deputy is equipped with a single electric thruster. Indeed, this represents a technological solution that is becoming widely employed by the producers of small-satellite platforms. While adopting a single electric thruster does reduce the required power, weight, and size of the orbit control system, it comes at the cost of rendering the satellite under-actuated. In this setting, the satellite can provide a desired thrust vector only after an attitude maneuver is carried out to redirect the thruster nozzle opposite to the desired thrust direction. In order to further extend the applicability range of such under-actuated platforms, guidance strategies are developed to support different reconfiguration scenarios for N-satellite formations. This paper starts from a classical non-convex quadratically constrained trajectory optimization formulation, which passes through multiple simplifications and approximations to arrive to two novel convex formulations, namely a second-order cone programming formulation, and a linear programming one. Out of five guidance formulations proposed in this article, the most promising three were compared through an extensive benchmark analysis that is applied to fifteen of the most widely-used solvers. This benchmark experiment provides information about the key distinctions between the different problem formulations, and under which conditions each one of them can be recommended.</description>

      <title>Koopman-LQR Controller for Quadrotor UAVs from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrotor systems are common and beneficial for many fields, but their intricate behavior often makes it challenging to design effective and optimal control strategies. Some traditional approaches to nonlinear control often rely on local linearizations or complex nonlinear models, which can be inaccurate or computationally expensive. We present a data-driven approach to identify the dynamics of a given quadrotor system using Koopman operator theory. Koopman theory offers a framework for representing nonlinear dynamics as linear operators acting on observable functions of the state space. This allows to approximate nonlinear systems with globally linear models in a higher dimensional space, which can be analyzed and controlled using standard linear optimal control techniques. We leverage the method of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to identify Koopman operator from data with total least squares. We demonstrate that the identified model can be stabilized and controllable by designing a controller using linear quadratic regulator (LQR).</description>

      <title>Tiered Service Architecture for Remote Patient Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a remote patient monitoring (RPM) service architecture, which has two tiers of monitoring: ordinary and intensive. The patient's health state improves or worsens in each time period according to certain probabilities, which depend on the monitoring tier. The patient incurs a "loss of quality of life" cost or an "invasiveness" cost, which is higher under intensive monitoring than under ordinary. On the other hand, their health improves faster under intensive monitoring than under ordinary. In each period, the service decides which monitoring tier to use, based on the health of the patient. We investigate the optimal policy for making that choice by formulating the problem using dynamic programming. We first provide analytic conditions for selecting ordinary vs intensive monitoring in the asymptotic regime where the number of health states is large. In the general case, we investigate the optimal policy numerically. We observe a threshold behavior, that is, when the patient's health drops below a certain threshold the service switches them to intensive monitoring, while ordinary monitoring is used during adequately good health states of the patient. The modeling and analysis provides a general framework for managing RPM services for various health conditions with medically/clinically defined system parameters.</description>

      <title>Coordination of Transmission and Distribution Systems in Load Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power distribution system is evolving in the form of an intelligent grid. The proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) makes the previously passive system active and more complicated. With the adoption of de-carbonization principles, large-scale coal and nuclear power plants are being gradually replaced by renewables and carbon-free DERs. With this rapid transformation, the power system operates with less inertia and minimal margins. In recent years, power systems have been facing apocalyptic weather events more frequently, and large-scale blackouts have become regular. After the complete or partial blackouts, the power system goes through different stages before it reaches the normal operating condition. The load restoration is the stage where the power system is fully established after the blackouts; however, due to the limiting ramping rates of centralized generation, the energization of large amounts of loads is delayed by some time. To mitigate the negative impact of ramping rates of centralized generation, DERs in distribution systems are proposed to serve the loads in both transmission and distribution systems in coordination with limited centralized generation in the transmission system. The problem is formulated as a centralized or integrated transmission and distribution (T$\&amp;$D) coordination model. The modified IEEE 14 bus test case and IEEE 13 node test feeders are used to validate the proposed strategy; the results indicate the validity of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>USLC: Universal Self-Learning Control via Physical Performance Policy-Optimization Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of achieving real-time Universal Self-Learning Control (USLC) in nonlinear dynamic systems with uncertain models. The proposed control method incorporates a Universal Self-Learning module, which introduces a model-free online executor-evaluator framework to enable controller adaptation in the presence of unknown disturbances. By leveraging a neural network model trained on historical system performance data, the controller can autonomously learn to approximate optimal performance during each learning cycle. Consequently, the controller's structural parameters are incrementally adjusted to achieve a performance threshold comparable to human-level performance. Utilizing nonlinear system stability theory, specifically in the context of three-dimensional manifold space, we demonstrate the stability of USLC in Lipschitz continuous systems. We illustrate the USLC framework numerically with two case studies: a low-order circuit system and a high-order morphing fixed-wing attitude control system. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and universality of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Connectivity Control and Maintenance in Multi-Agent Networks under Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of increasing the connectivity of an ad-hoc peer-to-peer network subject to cyber-attacks targeting the agents in the network. The adopted strategy involves the design of local interaction rules for the agents to locally modify the graph topology by adding and removing links with neighbors. Two distributed protocols are presented to boost the algebraic connectivity of the network graph beyond $k-2\sqrt{k-1}$ where $k\in \mathbb{N}$ is a free design parameter; these two protocols are achieved through the distributed construction of random (approximate) regular graphs. One protocol leverages coordinated actions between pairs of neighboring agents and is mathematically proven to converge to the desired graph topology. The other protocol relies solely on the uncoordinated actions of individual agents and it is validated by a spectral analysis through Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical simulations offer a comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art algorithms, showing the ability of both proposed protocols to maintain high levels of connectivity despite attacks carried out with full knowledge of the network structure, and highlighting their superior performance.</description>

      <title>Addressing intra-area oscillations and frequency stability after DC segmentation of a large AC power system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decades, various events have shown that electromechanical oscillations are a major concern for large interconnected Alternating Current (AC) power systems. Segmentation of AC power systems with High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems (DC segmentation, for short) is a method that consists in turning large AC grids into a set of asynchronous AC clusters linked by HVDC links. It is a promising solution to mitigate electromechanical oscillations and other issues. In particular, an appropriately placed DC segmentation can stop a selected inter-area electromechanical oscillation mode. However, without supplementary controllers, DC segmentation will not contribute to the damping of the intra-area oscillation modes in the remaining AC clusters and will deteriorate the frequency stability of the power system. This paper aims at filling this gap and proposes the use of DC segmentation with HVDC systems based on Voltage Source Converters (VSC-HVDC) with supplementary controllers in the converter stations: (a) active-power supplementary controllers for frequency support among the asynchronous AC clusters and (b) a reactive-power supplementary controllers for Power Oscillation Damping (POD-Q), in order to damp the intra-area oscillation modes. The proposed supplementary controllers and their design will be presented, and their efficiency will be demonstrated on the Nordic 44 test system with DC segmentation by means of non-linear time-domain simulation and small-signal stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a Low-Power Low-Noise Biopotential Amplifier in 28 nm CMOS Technology with a Compact Die-Area of 2500~\si{\micro\meter\squared}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a compact low-power, low-noise bioamplifier for multi-channel electrode arrays, aimed at recording action potentials. The design we put forth attains a notable decrease in both size and power consumption. This is achieved by incorporating an active lowpass filter that doesn't rely on bulky DC-blocking capacitors, and by utilizing the TSMC 28 nm HPC CMOS technology. This paper presents extensive simulation results of noise and results from measured performance. With a mid-band gain of 58 dB, a -~3~dB bandwidth of 7 kHz (from 150 Hz to 7.1 kHz), and an input-referred noise of 15.8~\si{\micro\volt_{rms}} corresponding to a NEF of 12. The implemented design achieves a favourable trade-off between noise, area, and power consumption, surpassing previous findings in terms of size and power. The amplifier occupies the smallest area of 2500~\si{\micro\meter\squared} and consumes only 3.4~\si{\micro\watt} from a 1.2 V power supply corresponding to a power efficiency factor of 175 and an area efficiency factor of 0.43, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Input-to-state stability (ISS) unifies global asymptotic stability with respect to variations of initial conditions with robustness with respect to external disturbances. First, we present Lyapunov characterizations for input-to-state stability as well as ISS superpositions theorems showing relations of ISS to other robust stability properties. Next, we present one of the characteristic applications of the ISS framework - the design of event-based control schemes for the stabilization of nonlinear systems. In the second half of the paper, we focus on small-gain theorems for stability analysis of finite and infinite networks with input-to-state stable components. First, we present a classical small-gain theorem in terms of trajectories for the feedback interconnection of 2 nonlinear systems. Finally, a recent Lyapunov-based small-gain result for a network with infinitely many ISS components is shown.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Data Significance in Remote Estimation of Discrete-State Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the semantics-aware remote estimation of a discrete-state Markov source with normal (low-priority) and alarm (high-priority) states. Erroneously announcing a normal state at the destination when the source is actually in an alarm state (i.e., missed alarm error) incurs a significantly higher cost than falsely announcing an alarm state when the source is in a normal state (i.e., false alarm error). Moreover, successive reception of an estimation error may cause significant lasting impact, e.g., maintenance cost and misoperations. Motivated by this, we assign different costs to different estimation errors and introduce two new age metrics, namely the Age of Missed Alarm (AoMA) and the Age of False Alarm (AoFA), to account for the lasting impact incurred by different estimation errors. Notably, the two age processes evolve dependently and can distinguish between different types of estimation errors and different synced states. The aim is to achieve an optimal trade-off between the cost of estimation error, lasting impact, and communication utilization. The problem is formulated as an average-cost, countably infinite state-space Markov decision process (MDP). We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching-type structure, making it amenable to policy storage and algorithm design. Notably, when the source is symmetric and states are equally important, the optimal policy has identical thresholds, i.e., threshold-type. Theoretical and numerical results underscore that our approach extends the current understanding of the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) and the cost of actuation error (CAE), showing that they are specific instances within our broader framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper present a novel approach for the solution of the Multi-Robot Communication-Aware Trajectory Planning, which builds on a general optimisation framework where the changes in robots positions are used as decision variable, and linear constraints on the trajectories of the robots are introduced to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. The Fiedler value is adopted as communication performance metric. The validity of the method in computing both feasible and optimal trajectories for the robots is demonstrated both in simulation and experimentally. Results show that the constraint on the Fiedler value ensures that the robot network fulfils its objective while maintaining communication connectivity at all times. Further, the paper shows that the introduction of approximations for the constraints enables a significant improvement in the computational time of the solution, which remain very close to the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>System for Measurement of Electric Energy Using Beacons with Optical Sensors and LoRaWAN Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the results of experiments with finding an efficient radio transmission method for an electric energy measurement system called OneMeter 2.0. This system offers a way of collecting energy usage data from beacons attached to regular, non-smart meters. In our study, we compared several low power wide area network (LPWAN) protocols, out of which we chose the LoRaWAN protocol. We verified the energy consumption of a LoRa-based transmission unit, as well as the transmission range between network nodes in urban conditions. We discovered that LoRaWAN-based transmission was highly energy-efficient and offered decent coverage, even in a difficult, dense urban environment.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to find new identifiable reparametrizations of parametric rational ODE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural identifiability concerns the question of which unknown parameters of a model can be recovered from (perfect) input-output data. If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input-output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can either adjust the model, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparametrization to make the model identifiable. In this paper, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparametrizations were limited to scaling reparametrizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparametrization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input-output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparametrization always exists and show that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, an explicit reparametrization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in supplementary material on github.</description>

      <title>Bounding Stochastic Safety: Leveraging Freedman's Inequality with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical robust safety methods achieve their guarantees by always assuming that the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) and c-martingales to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive safety constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as input-to-state safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is stronger. Finally, we present simulation examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.</description>

      <title>Learning Low-dimensional Latent Dynamics from High-dimensional Observations: Non-asymptotics and Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on learning a linear time-invariant (LTI) model with low-dimensional latent variables but high-dimensional observations. We provide an algorithm that recovers the high-dimensional features, i.e. column space of the observer, embeds the data into low dimensions and learns the low-dimensional model parameters. Our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity guarantee of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n/\epsilon^2)$, where $n$ is the observation dimension. We further establish a fundamental lower bound indicating this complexity bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and dimension-independent constants. We show that this inevitable linear factor of $n$ is due to the learning error of the observer's column space in the presence of high-dimensional noises. Extending our results, we consider a meta-learning problem inspired by various real-world applications, where the observer column space can be collectively learned from datasets of multiple LTI systems. An end-to-end algorithm is then proposed, facilitating learning LTI systems from a meta-dataset which breaks the sample complexity lower bound in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enabling Large Language Models to Perform Power System Simulations with Previously Unseen Tools: A Case of Daline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of experiment technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research, offering AI capabilities beyond specialized problem-solving to becoming research assistants for human scientists. In power systems, simulations are essential for research. However, LLMs face significant challenges in power system simulations due to limited pre-existing knowledge and the complexity of power grids. To address this issue, this work proposes a modular framework that integrates expertise from both the power system and LLM domains. This framework enhances LLMs' ability to perform power system simulations on previously unseen tools. Validated using 34 simulation tasks in Daline, a (optimal) power flow simulation and linearization toolbox not yet exposed to LLMs, the proposed framework improved GPT-4o's simulation coding accuracy from 0% to 96.07%, also outperforming the ChatGPT-4o web interface's 33.8% accuracy (with the entire knowledge base uploaded). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as research assistants in power systems.</description>

      <title>The Brain-Inspired Cooperative Shared Control for Brain-Machine Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the practical application of brain-machine interface technology, the problem often faced is the low information content and high noise of the neural signals collected by the electrode and the difficulty of decoding by the decoder, which makes it difficult for the robotic to obtain stable instructions to complete the task. The idea based on the principle of cooperative shared control can be achieved by extracting general motor commands from brain activity, while the fine details of the movement can be hosted to the robot for completion, or the brain can have complete control. This study proposes a brain-machine interface shared control system based on spiking neural networks for robotic arm movement control and wheeled robots wheel speed control and steering, respectively. The former can reliably control the robotic arm to move to the destination position, while the latter controls the wheeled robots for object tracking and map generation. The results show that the shared control based on brain-inspired intelligence can perform some typical tasks in complex environments and positively improve the fluency and ease of use of brain-machine interaction, and also demonstrate the potential of this control method in clinical applications of brain-machine interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Simple Finite-Time Analysis of TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-time convergence of TD learning with linear function approximation under Markovian sampling. Existing proofs for this setting either assume a projection step in the algorithm to simplify the analysis, or require a fairly intricate argument to ensure stability of the iterates. We ask: \textit{Is it possible to retain the simplicity of a projection-based analysis without actually performing a projection step in the algorithm?} Our main contribution is to show this is possible via a novel two-step argument. In the first step, we use induction to prove that under a standard choice of a constant step-size $\alpha$, the iterates generated by TD learning remain uniformly bounded in expectation. In the second step, we establish a recursion that mimics the steady-state dynamics of TD learning up to a bounded perturbation on the order of $O(\alpha^2)$ that captures the effect of Markovian sampling. Combining these pieces leads to an overall approach that considerably simplifies existing proofs. We conjecture that our inductive proof technique will find applications in the analyses of more complex stochastic approximation algorithms, and conclude by providing some examples of such applications.</description>

      <title>RL in Latent MDPs is Tractable: Online Guarantees via Off-Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world decision problems there is partially observed, hidden or latent information that remains fixed throughout an interaction. Such decision problems can be modeled as Latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs), where a latent variable is selected at the beginning of an interaction and is not disclosed to the agent. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in solving LMDPs under different structural assumptions. However, for general LMDPs, there is no known learning algorithm that provably matches the existing lower bound (Kwon et al., 2021). We introduce the first sample-efficient algorithm for LMDPs without any additional structural assumptions. Our result builds off a new perspective on the role of off-policy evaluation guarantees and coverage coefficients in LMDPs, a perspective, that has been overlooked in the context of exploration in partially observed environments. Specifically, we establish a novel off-policy evaluation lemma and introduce a new coverage coefficient for LMDPs. Then, we show how these can be used to derive near-optimal guarantees of an optimistic exploration algorithm. These results, we believe, can be valuable for a wide range of interactive learning problems beyond LMDPs, and especially, for partially observed environments.</description>
