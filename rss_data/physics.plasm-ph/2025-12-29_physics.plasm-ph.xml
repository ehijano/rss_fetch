      <title>Revealing the transient ionization dynamics and mode-coupling mechanisms of helicon discharge through a self-consistent multiphysics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicon plasma sources play a central role in applications ranging from material treatment to space propulsion and fusion, yet the physical processes governing their ignition, transient ionization, and mode evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we develop a self-consistent, fully coupled multiphysics framework that integrates Maxwell equations, electron energy transport, drift-diffusion kinetics, and heavy-species chemistry to capture the complete spatiotemporal evolution of helicon discharges. The model reproduces experimental measurements across pressure, magnetic field, and frequency ranges, and reveals a previously unresolved transient ionization stage characterized by a rapid density rise within ~10-4 s, accompanied by a two-peak electron temperature structure that governs the formation of the dense plasma core. By tracking the RF power flow and field topology, we characterize the transient redistribution of RF energy during ignition. A short-lived phase of localized energy deposition accompanies the onset of ionization, followed by an evolution toward helicon-like field characteristics together with rapid density growth and profile restructuring. Systematic parametric scans further reveal the sensitivity of this mode-coupling process to gas pressure, magnetic field strength, and driving frequency. These results provide a unified picture of the ignition and mode-transition physics in helicon plasmas and establish a predictive tool for the design and optimization of RF plasma sources across space propulsion, manufacturing, and fusion technologies.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced "Flux-Corrected Transport"-Based Plasmasphere Refilling Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A previously developed multi-ion, two-stream Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) hydrodynamic model for plasmasphere refilling has been extended to incorporate self-consistent electron temperature evolution. The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Line Chaos, Cantori, and Turnstiles in Toroidal Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although magnetic field line chaos, cantori, and turnstiles underlie the physics of tokamak disruptions, runaway electron damage, stellarator non-resonant divertors, and the most important electromagnetic correction to what are called electrostatic micro-instabilities, these concepts are not well known. These concepts will be defined and applications that illustrate their importance will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Isotope Production in Muon-Catalyzed-Fusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Producing valuable isotopes with high-flux high-energy neutrons generated by muon-catalyzed fusion ($\mu$CF) reactions could substantially improve the economic prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion. Because no external heating is required for $\mu$CF, heat flux constraints are significantly relaxed compared with fusion systems requiring external heating. This could allow $\mu$CF to attain much higher neutron flux without breaching material heat flux limits. If muon production rates can be increased, $\mu$CF systems employing transmutation could be viable well before energy breakeven is possible. For $\mu$CF systems transmuting valuable isotopes, the required number of catalyzed fusion events per muon and muon energy generation cost can be relaxed by several orders of magnitude relative to electricity-generating systems, making $\mu$CF an attractive high-flux neutron source. We show an example $\mu$CF system with a 10 gram ${}^{226}\mathrm{Ra}$ feedstock and a steady-state muon rate of $10^{12}$ muons / second - roughly half a kilowatt of fusion power - could produce 20 mg of ${}^{225}\mathrm{Ac}$ per year - comparable to 400 times global supply in 2024. As higher muon rate sources become available, many other radioisotope transmutation pathways become viable. These findings motivate the accelerated development of $\mu$CF systems for neutron-driven isotope production far before net energy generation is possible.</description>

      <title>Minijets and Broken Stationarity in a Blazar : Novel Insights into the Origin of $\gamma$-ray Variability in CTA 102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $\gamma$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.</description>
