      <title>Phase diagram and universal scaling regimes of two-dimensional exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many systems, classical or quantum, closed or open, exhibit universal statistical properties. Exciton-polariton condensates, being intrinsically driven-dissipative, offer a promising platform for observing non-equilibrium universal features. By conducting extensive numerical simulations of an incoherently pumped and interacting condensate coupled to an exciton reservoir we show that the effective nonlinearity of the condensate phase dynamics can be finely adjusted across a broad range, by varying the exciton-polariton interaction strength, allowing one to probe three main universal regimes with parameters accessible in current experiments: the weakly nonlinear Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime, where the phase fluctuations dominate, but the phase profile does not become rough, the strongly non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang regime, where the condensate phase fluctuations grow in a superdiffusive manner leading to roughening of the phase, and a vortex-dominated phase emerging at stronger interactions, where both density and phase dynamics play significant roles. Our results provide a unified picture of the phase diagram of 2d exciton-polariton condensates under incoherent pumping, and shed light on recent experimental and numerical observations.</description>

      <title>Transport of Vector Solitons in Spin-Dependent Nonlinear Thouless Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonlinear topological physics, Thouless pumping of nonlinear excitations is a central topic, often illustrated by scalar solitons. Vector solitons, with the additional spin degree of freedom, exhibit phenomena absent in scalar solitons due to enriched interplay between nonlinearity and topology. Here, we theoretically investigate Thouless pumping of vector solitons in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate confined in spin-dependent optical superlattices, using both numerical solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the Lagrangian variational approach. The spin-up and spin-down components experience superlattice potentials that are displaced by a tunable distance $d_r$, leading to a vector soliton state with a relative shift between its components. We demonstrate that $d_r$, as an independent degree of freedom, offers a novel control parameter for manipulating the nonlinear topological phase transition of vector solitons. Specifically, when $d_r=0$, both components are either pumped or arrested, depending on the interaction strength. When fixing the interaction strength and varying $d_r$, remarkably, we find that an arrested vector soliton can re-enter the pumped regime and exhibits a quantized shift. As $d_r$ continues to increase, the vector soliton transitions into a dynamically arrested state; however, with further increases in $d_r$, the quantized shift revives. Our work paves new routes for engineering nonlinear topological pumping of solitons in spinor systems by utilizing the relative motion degrees of freedom between different spin components.</description>

      <title>Fate of the spatial-temporal order under quantum fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous theoretical work [arXiv:2205.01461], T. Esslinger group proposed a scheme to realize a spatial-temporal lattice, which possesses dual periodicity on space and time, in a cavity-boson system pumped by a travelling wave laser. However, the prediction was made under the mean-field approximation. In this work, we investigate the dynamics beyond mean-field approximation. By including the fluctuation of the cavity field, we obtain a larger set of equations of motion. Numerical results show that the spatial-temporal lattice is melted in the mean-field level but survives in the quantum fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Halo Trimer in an Ultracold Bose-Fermi Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics of three interacting particles gives rise to interesting universal phenomena, such as the staircase of Efimov trimers predicted in the context of nuclear physics and observed in ultracold gases. Here, we observe a novel type of halo trimer using radiofrequency spectroscopy in an ultracold mixture of $^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K atoms. The trimers consist of two light bosons and one heavy fermion, and have the structure of a Feshbach dimer weakly bound to one additional boson. We find that the trimer peak closely follows the dimer resonance over the entire range of explored interaction strengths across an order of magnitude variation of the dimer energy, as reproduced by our theoretical analysis. The presence of this halo trimer is of direct relevance for many-body physics in ultracold mixtures and the association of ultracold molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which encodes optimization problems on graphs with arbitrary connectivity into Rydberg atom arrays. Here, a graph vertex is represented by a wire of atoms, and the (crossing) crossing-with-edge gadget is placed at the intersection of two wires to (de)couple their degrees of freedom and reproduce the graph connectivity. We consider the fundamental geometry of two vertex-wires intersecting via a single gadget and look at minimum gap scaling with system size along adiabatic protocols. We find that both polynomial and exponential scaling are possible and, by means of perturbation theory, we relate the exponential closing of the minimum gap to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. Then, on the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose possible strategies to avoid this quantum bottleneck, leading to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance.</description>

      <title>Many-body nonequilibrium dynamics in a self-induced Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet systems are periodically driven systems. In this framework, the system Hamiltonian and associated spectra of interest are modified, giving rise to new quantum phases of matter and nonequilibrium dynamics without static counterparts. Here we experimentally demonstrate a self-induced Floquet system in the interacting Rydberg gas. This originates from the motion of photoionized charge particles in a static magnetic field. Importantly, by leveraging the Rydberg electomagnetically induced transparency spectrum, we probe the nonequilibrium dynamics in the bistable regime, where the strong Rydberg atom interaction competes with the internal driving from flying charges, and identify the emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase. Our work fills the experimental gap in the understanding the relation of multistability and dissipative discrete time crystalline phase. In this regard, it constitutes a highly controlled platform for exploring exotic nonequilibrium physics in dissipative interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic properties of the warm dense uniform electron gas with the qSTLS dielectric scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently derived Fourier--Matsubara expansion of imaginary--time correlation functions comprises an exact result of linear response theory for finite-temperature quantum many-body systems. In its density--density version, the expansion facilitates systematic comparisons between quasi-exact \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations and approximate dielectric formalism schemes at the level of the imaginary--time (density--density) correlation functions and the dynamic Matsubara local field corrections. On this theoretical basis, the dynamic properties of the quantum version of the Singwi--Tosi--Land--Sj\"olander scheme are analyzed for the paramagnetic warm dense uniform electron gas. The marginal improvement compared to the semi-classical version of the Singwi--Tosi--Land--Sj\"olander scheme is attributed to the weak Matsubara order dependence of the approximate dynamic Matsubara local field correction. The evaluation of the ideal density response function at the non-interacting occupation numbers is identified to constitute a general deficiency of the dielectric formalism, which calls for a reformulation in future works.</description>

      <title>From bosons and fermions to spins: A multi-mode extension of the Jordan-Schwinger map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jordan-Schwinger map is widely employed to switch between bosonic or fermionic mode operators and spin observables, with numerous applications ranging from quantum field theories of magnetism and ultracold quantum gases to quantum optics. While the construction of observables obeying the algebra of spin operators across multiple modes is straightforward, a mapping between bosonic or fermionic Fock states and spin states has remained elusive beyond the two-mode case. Here, we generalize the Jordan-Schwinger map by algorithmically constructing complete sets of spin states over several bosonic or fermionic modes, allowing one to describe arbitrary multi-mode systems faithfully in terms of spins. As a byproduct, we uncover a deep link between the degeneracy of multi-mode spin states in the bosonic case and Gaussian polynomials. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by deriving explicit relations between arbitrary three-mode Fock and spin states, which provide novel interpretations of the genuinely tripartite entangled GHZ and W state classes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic instabilities and turbulence of merged rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the simulation results of merging harmonically confined rotating Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions. Merging of the condensate is triggered by positioning the rotation axis at the trap minima and moving both condensates towards each other while slowly ramping their rotation frequency. We analyze the dynamics of the merged condensate by letting them evolve under a single harmonic trap. We systematically investigate the formation of solitonic and vortex structures in the final, unified condensate, considering both non-rotating and rotating initial states. In both cases, merging leads to the formation of solitons that decay into vortex pairs through snake instability, and subsequently, these pairs annihilate. Soliton formation and decay-induced phase excitations generate sound waves, more pronounced when the merging time is short. We witness no sound wave generation at sufficiently longer merging times that finally leads to the condensate reaching its ground state. With rotation, we notice off-axis merging (where the rotation axes are not aligned), leading to the distortion and weakening of soliton formation. The incompressible kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a Kolmogorov-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-5/3}$] in the initial stage for merging condensates rotating above a critical frequency and a Vinen-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-1}$] at a later time for all cases. Our findings hold potential significance for atomic interferometry, continuous atomic lasers, and quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate plateau transition and equilibration in 1D quantum lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a remarkable spectral phenomenon in a generic type of quantum lattice gas model. As the interaction strength increases, eigenstates spontaneously reorganize and lead to plateaus of the interaction energy, with gaps opening akin to continuous phase transitions. Perturbation theory identifies a hidden structure underlying eigenstates within each plateau, resulting in a statistical shift in the wavefunction amplitudes described by extreme value theory. The structured eigenstates manifest themselves naturally in far-from-equilibrium dynamics proceeding through multiple universal stages. Our findings reveal a profound connection between emergent properties in high-energy states and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, providing insights into the impact of interactions across the entire energy spectrum. The results are directly relevant to experiments probing equilibration in quantum spin and lattice gases.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fault-tolerant Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. Furthermore, we explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>
