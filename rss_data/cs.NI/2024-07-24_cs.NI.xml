      <title>AoI, Timely-Throughput, and Beyond: A Theory of Second-Order Wireless Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new theoretical framework for optimizing second-order behaviors of wireless networks. Unlike existing techniques for network utility maximization, which only consider first-order statistics, this framework models every random process by its mean and temporal variance. The inclusion of temporal variance makes this framework well-suited for modeling Markovian fading wireless channels and emerging network performance metrics such as age-of-information (AoI) and timely-throughput. Using this framework, we sharply characterize the second-order capacity region of wireless access networks. We also propose a simple scheduling policy and prove that it can achieve every interior point in the second-order capacity region. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, we apply it to an unsolved network optimization problem where some clients wish to minimize AoI while others wish to maximize timely-throughput. We show that this framework accurately characterizes AoI and timely-throughput. Moreover, it leads to a tractable scheduling policy that outperforms other existing work.</description>

      <title>DOLOS: Tricking the Wi-Fi APs with Incorrect User Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi-based indoor localization has been extensively studied for context-aware services. As a result, the accurate Wi-Fi-based indoor localization introduces a great location privacy threat. However, the existing solutions for location privacy protection are hard to implement on current devices. They require extra hardware deployment in the environment or hardware modifications at the transmitter or receiver side. To this end, we propose DOLOS, a system that can protect the location privacy of the Wi-Fi user with a novel signal obfuscation approach. DOLOSis a software-only solution that can be deployed on existing protocol-compliant Wi-Fi user devices. We provide this obfuscation by invalidating a simple assumption made by most localization systems -- "direct path signal arrives earlier than all the reflections to distinguish this direct path prior to estimating the location". However, DOLOS creates a novel software fix that allows the user to transmit the signal wherein this direct path arrives later, creating ambiguity in the location estimates. Our experimental results demonstrate DOLOS can degrade the localization accuracy of state-of-art systems by 6x for a single AP and 2.5x for multiple AP scenarios, thereby protecting the Wi-Fi user's location privacy without compromising the Wi-Fi communication performance.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Traffic Processing Using Programmable Hardware Flow Offload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of data traffic and the increasing complexity of networked applications demand effective solutions capable of passively inspecting and analysing the network traffic for monitoring and security purposes. Implementing network probes in software using general-purpose operating systems has been made possible by advances in packet-capture technologies, such as kernel-bypass frameworks, and by multi-queue adapters designed to distribute the network workload in multi-core processors. Modern SmartNICs, in addition, have introduced stateful mechanisms to associate actions to network flows such as forwarding packets or updating traffic statistics for an individual flow. In this paper, we describe our experience in exploiting those functionalities in a modern network probe and we perform a detailed study of the performance characteristics under different scenarios. Compared to pure CPU-based solutions, SmartNICs with flow-offload technologies provide substantial benefits when implementing forwarding applications. However, the main limitation of having to keep large flow tables in the host memory remains largely unsolved for realistic monitoring and security applications.</description>

      <title>SIC-based Random Multiple Access Protocol: Fixed or Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient data collection from a multitude of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is crucial for various applications, yet existing solutions often struggle with minimizing access delay and Age of Information (AoI), especially when managing multiple simultaneous transmissions and access strategies. This challenge becomes increasingly critical as IoT deployments continue to expand, demanding robust mechanisms for handling diverse traffic scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel approach leveraging Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) based on adaptive and fixed parameter schemes to address these limitations. By analyzing both throughput and AoI along with access delay, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive approach compared to the fixed approach, particularly in scenarios featuring heavy and light traffic. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of adaptive approaches in optimizing data collection processes in IoT ecosystems, with a particular focus on minimizing access delay, AoI, and spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spatial Reuse in IEEE 802.11bn Coordinated Multi-AP WLANs: A Throughput Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IEEE 802.11 networks continuously adapt to meet the stringent requirements of emerging applications like cloud gaming, eXtended Reality (XR), and video streaming services, which require high throughput, low latency, and high reliability. To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (C-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable a higher number of simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of C-SR in Wi-Fi 8 networks. In particular, we consider an implementation of C-SR where channel access and inter-Access Point (AP) communication are performed over-the-air using the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). For such a purpose, we leverage the well-known Bianchi's throughput model and extend it to support multi-AP transmissions via C-SR. Numerical results in a WLAN network that consists of four APs show C-SR throughput gains ranging from 54% to 280% depending on the inter-AP distance and the position of the stations in the area.</description>

      <title>Securing The Future Of Healthcare: Building A Resilient Defense System For Patient Data Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing importance of data in the healthcare sector has led to a rise in cybercrime targeting patient information. Data breaches pose significant financial and reputational risks to many healthcare organizations including clinics and hospitals. This study aims to propose the ideal approach to developing a defense system that ensures that patient data is protected from the insidious acts of healthcare data threat actors. Using a gradientboosting classifier machine learning model, the study predicts the severity of healthcare data breaches. Secondary data was collected from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Portal with key indicators. Also, the study gathers key cyber-security data from Kaggle, which was utilized for the study. The findings revealed that hacking and IT incidents are the most common type of breaches in the healthcare industry, with network servers being targeted in most cases. The model evaluation showed that the gradient boosting algorithm performs well. Therefore, the study recommends that organizations implement comprehensive security protocols, particularly focusing on robust network security to protect servers</description>

      <title>6G at $\frac{1}{6}g$: The Future of Cislunar Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What will the future of cislunar communications be? The ever-expanding horizons of the space exploration missions, and the need for establishing sustainable space communication and navigation infrastructure necessitate to think this question thoroughly. In this article, we examine how some of the concepts of 6G technologies developed for terrestrial networks can be relevant in the context of cislunar networks. We discuss how 6G concepts, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, quantum-resistant physical layer security, private information read/write/cache networks, semantic and goal-oriented communications, information freshness based quality of communication metrics, multi-relay and cooperative networks, hold the potential to shape the future of cislunar communications.</description>

      <title>Active Admission Control in a P2P Distributed Environment for Capacity Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment (ACIDE) media distribution model solution and algorithms are proposed for livestreaming in capacity efficient mobile wireless networks. The elements of the ACIDE model are a base station and a cluster formed by a number of peers able to establish peer to peer communications. The cluster peers are selected from a group of users interested in livestreaming the same media. The ACIDE model solution minimizes the bandwidth allocated to a cluster of n peers such that an uninterrupted media play for all peers is guaranteed. The livestream media is sent to the peers in packages and every media package is divided into n blocks. The blocks are distributed to the n peers of a cluster in two phases, such that the base station bandwidth is utilized during first phase only. The allocated bandwidth, the amount of bandwidth the base station has to allocate to a cluster, is minimized and its lower bound is equal to the bandwidth required for multicasting. In this study, the ACIDE model is used to address the problem of how to find the maximum number of peers n, chosen from a group of N users, that can be admitted to a cluster knowing the given allocated bandwidth, the amount of bandwidth that a base station allocates to a cluster in advance, prior to admitting users. When users become peers of an ACIDE cluster, the network capacity, the total number of users who are able to access live media, increases meaning that network resources are used more efficiently. The problem of finding the maximum number of peers n is addressed as an optimization problem, with the objective of having the entire given allocated bandwidth used by the peers admitted to the cluster. This problem is NP-complete and a non-optimal solution is proposed for peers selection such that all admitted peers play media continuously.</description>

      <title>Honeybee: Decentralized Peer Sampling with Verifiable Random Walks for Blockchain Data Sharding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data sharding$\unicode{x2013}$in which block data is sharded without sharding compute$\unicode{x2013}$is at the present the favored approach for scaling Ethereum and other popular blockchains. A key challenge toward implementing data sharding is verifying whether the entirety of a block's data is available in the network (across its shards). A central technique proposed to conduct this verification uses erasure-coded blocks and is called data availability sampling (DAS). While the high-level protocol details of DAS have been well discussed in the community, discussions around how such a protocol will be implemented at the peer-to-peer layer are lacking. We identify random sampling of nodes as a fundamental primitive necessary to carry out DAS and present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of a large number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., 50% of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for DAS functions in both full nodes and light nodes.</description>
