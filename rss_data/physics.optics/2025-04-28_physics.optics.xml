      <title>Efficient and wavelength-tunable second-harmonic generation towards the green gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving compact and efficient visible laser sources is crucial for a wide range of applications. However traditional semiconductor laser technology faces difficulties in producing high-brightness green light, leaving a green gap in wavelength coverage. Second-harmonic generation (SHG) offers a promising alternative by converting near-infrared sources to visible wavelengths with high efficiency and spectral purity. Here, we demonstrate efficient and tunable SHG within the green spectrum using a high-Q Si3N4 microresonator. A space-charge grating induced by the photogalvanic effect realizes reconfigurable grating numbers and flexible wavelength tuning. Additionally, grating formation dynamics and competition is observed. These findings underscore the potential of silicon nitride as a robust, integrative platform for on-chip, tunable green light sources.</description>

      <title>Robust Poling and Frequency Conversion on Thin-Film Periodically Poled Lithium Tantalate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a robust fabrication process for periodically-poled thin-film lithium tantalate (PP-TFLT) by systematically varying fabrication parameters and confirming the quality of inverted domains with second-harmonic microscopy (SHM). We find a periodic poling recipe that can be applied to both acoustic-grade and optical-grade film, electrode material, and presence of an oxide interlayer. By using a single high-voltage electrical pulse with peak voltage time of 10 ms or less and a ramp-down time of 90 s, rectangular poling domains are established and stabilized in the PP-TFLT. We employ our robust periodic poling process in a controllable pole-after-etch approach to produce PP-TFLT ridge waveguides with normalized second harmonic generation (SHG) conversion efficiencies of 208 %W-1cm-2 from 1550 nm to 775 nm in line with the theoretical value of 244 %W-1cm-2. This work establishes a high-performance poling process and demonstrates telecommunications band SHG for thin-film lithium tantalate, expanding the capabilities of the platform for frequency mixing applications in quantum photonics, sensing, and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Influence of molecular rotation on the generation of N$_2^+$ air lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N$_2^+$ air lasing has attracted considerable attention due to its promising applications in remote sensing and the debates surrounding its generation mechanisms. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the role of molecular rotation in N$_2^+$ lasing at 391 nm ($B^2 \Sigma _u^+(v''=0)\rightarrow X^2 \Sigma _g^+ (v=0)$). By solving the open-system density matrix and Maxwell-Bloch equations in a rovibronic-state basis, we examine both the formation of the N$_2^+$ gain medium induced by a femtosecond pump pulse and the subsequent spatial propagation of the seed pulse. During the pump stage, rotational dynamics are found to significantly modify the angle-dependent populations of ionic vibrational-electronic states within tens of femtoseconds. Furthermore, ionization-produced rotational coherences substantially enhance the population inversion between the $X^2 \Sigma _g^+ (v=0)$ and $B^2 \Sigma _u^+(v''=0)$ states. In the seed propagation stage, both population inversion and rotational coherence are found to contribute to the lasing process, with the latter playing a dominant role in amplifying the lasing signals. These findings reveal the crucial role of molecular rotation in N$_2^+$ air lasing and highlight its potential as a tunable parameter for controlling lasing dynamics.</description>

      <title>Passive All-Optical Nonlinear Neuron Activation via PPLN Nanophotonic Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming modern life, yet the growing scale of AI applications places mounting demands on computational resources, raising sustainability concerns. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a promising alternative, enabling massive parallelism, low latency, and reduced electrical overhead, particularly excelling in high-throughput linear operations. However, passive and fully optical nonlinear activation functions with equally superb performance remain rare, posing a critical bottleneck in realizing all-optical neural networks on PICs. Here, we demonstrate a compact and readily integrated all-optical nonlinear activation function, experimentally realized through highly pump-depleted second-harmonic generation (SHG) in periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nanophotonic waveguides, achieving 79% absolute conversion efficiency. This activation exhibits a sigmoid-like, wavelength-selective response with femtosecond-scale dynamics and light-speed processing, requiring no electrical control or auxiliary optical signals. We further validate its feasibility for neural inference by combining the measured SHG-based nonlinearity with linear operations implemented via a Mach-Zehnder interferometer system on a silicon PIC. Our demonstration achieves performance on par with digital implementations in real-world tasks, including airfoil regression and medical image classification. These results pave the way toward scalable, high-speed, and fully integrated all-optical neural networks for next-generation photonic AI hardware.</description>

      <title>Copper-impurity-free photonic integrated circuits enable deterministic soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-scale optical frequency combs based on microresonators (microcombs) enable GHz-THz repetition rates, broad bandwidth, compactness, and compatibility with wafer-scale manufacturing. Silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits have become a leading platform due to their low loss, broad transparency, lithographic dispersion control, and commercial 200-mm-wafer foundry access. They have enabled system-level applications in optical communications, LiDAR, frequency synthesis, low-noise microwave generation, and convolutional processing. However, real-world deployment is hindered by the challenge of deterministic soliton microcomb generation, primarily due to thermal instabilities. Although techniques like pulsed pumping, fast scanning, and auxiliary lasers help mitigate these effects, they often add complexity or reduce soliton stability. In this work, we overcome thermal limitations and demonstrate deterministic soliton generation in silicon nitride photonic circuits. We trace the thermal effects to copper impurities within waveguides, originating from residual contaminants in CMOS-grade silicon wafers that are gettered into silicon nitride during fabrication. By developing effective copper removal techniques, we significantly reduce thermal instabilities. This enables soliton generation with arbitrary or slow laser scanning, removing a key barrier to microcomb deployment. Our approach is compatible with front-end-of-line foundry processing, paving the way for broader adoption of soliton microcomb technologies.</description>

      <title>Controlling the sign of optical forces using metaoptics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise manipulation of small objects using light holds transformative potential across diverse fields. While research in optical trapping and manipulation predominantly relies on the attraction of solid matter to light intensity maxima, here we demonstrate that meta-optics enables a departure from this accepted behavior. Specifically, we present deterministic control over the sign of optical forces exerted on a metasurface integrated on a suspended silicon nanomembrane. By tailoring the geometry of the constituent meta-atoms, we engineer the coherent superposition of their multipolar modes, and consequently, the net optical force experienced by the metasurface within a phase-controlled optical standing wave. In excellent agreement with 3D numerical simulations, we experimentally realize both attractive and repulsive forces on distinct metasurface designs, directly mirroring the behavior of two-level systems interacting with optical fields. This work establishes a versatile platform for the optical control of nanoscale mechanical systems, opening new avenues for both fundamental research and engineering.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Optical Spring in a Robustly Controlled Signal-Recycled Michelson Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first demonstration of an optical spring effect in a signal-recycled Michelson interferometer without arm cavities. While previous observations of optical springs in a signal-recycled interferometer have relied on configurations incorporating arm cavities, no similar effect has yet been reported in a bare configuration. The experimental setup employs multiple laser fields, enabling stable and precisely controllable detuning, as well as a compliant suspension system comprising two double-spiral springs. These findings open possibilities for developing optical spring-enhanced interferometers utilizing intracavity amplification, a promising technique for enhancing the high-frequency sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave detection instruments.</description>

      <title>A method for optically trapping nanospheres at micron range from a tilted mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel optical method for trapping and cooling dielectric nanospheres at (sub)-micron distances from a reflective metallic surface. By translating a tilted mirror towards the focus of a single-beam optical tweezer, the optical trap transitions into an off-axis standing-wave configuration due to interference between the incident and reflected beams. Stable potential minima emerge within a finite overlap region close to the surface, with their number, shape, and distance from the surface tunable via the incidence angle, waist, and polarization of the incoming beam. This configuration enables deterministic selection of trapping sites as the system transitions from the single-beam trap to the off-axis standing wave trap. We validate this approach using a $170$ nm diameter silica sphere in a single-beam trap with a $1.5$ $\mu$m waist and transitioning it into the second or first potential minimum of the standing wave trap, located $1.61$ $\mu$m or $0.55$ $\mu$m from the surface, respectively. The experimental results align well with our theoretical model, supported by numerical simulations of the Langevin equations of motion. Additionally, we perform parametric feedback cooling of all three motional degrees of freedom in a high-vacuum environment. This method provides a robust platform for ultra-sensitive scanning surface force sensing at micron distances from a reflective surface in high vacuum and may open new pathways for short-range gravity or Casimir effect measurements.</description>

      <title>Tailoring hBN's Phonon Polaritons with the Plasmonic Phase-Change Material In3SbTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18418v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons in van-der-Waals materials (vdWM) promise high confinement and multiple tailoring options by optical structures, e.g., resonators, launching structures and lenses. These optical structures are conventionally fabricated using cumbersome multi-process lithography techniques. In contrast, phase-change materials (PCMs) offer fast and reconfigurable programming of optical structures. PCMs can reversibly be switched between two stable phases with distinct permittivities by local heating, e.g., by optical laser pulses. While the well-known dielectric PCM GeSbTe-alloys feature only a permittivity change, the PCM In3SbTe2 can be switched between a dielectric and metallic phase. This makes In3SbTe2 promising for programming metallic launching structures. Here, we demonstrate direct optical programming and thereby rapid prototyping of optical launching structures in In3SbTe2 to tailor and confine polaritons in vdWM. We combine the vdWM hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with In3SbTe2 and optically program circular resonators for hBN's phonon polaritons through hBN into In3SbTe2. We investigate the polariton resonators with near-field optical microscopy. Demonstrating the reconfigurability, we decrease the resonator diameter to increase the polariton confinement. Finally, we fabricate focusing structures for hBN's phonon polaritons whose focal point is changed in a second post-processing step. We promote In3SbTe2 as a versatile platform for rapid prototyping of polariton optics in vdWM.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Long-Term Stable Photonic Microwaves based on a Difference Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a novel method for optical microwave generation using a frequency comb based on difference-frequency generation, which passively eliminates the carrier-envelope offset frequency ($f_{\mathrm{ceo}}$), with the repetition rate ($f_{\mathrm{rep}}$) locked to an optical reference. We demonstrate the generation of ultra-low phase noise microwave signals by transferring the stability of the optical reference to 9.6 GHz, reaching noise levels of -147 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset. The optimization of pulse timing after interleaving and a scheme for additional long-term stabilization of the microwave signal to GPS standards are discussed. This work presents a new variant of highly stable RF signal generation for precision applications, such as radar, atomic clock local oscillators and optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Coherent nonlinear optical probe for cavity-dressed vibrational mode mixing: multidimensional double-quantum coherence and photon-echo signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity modulation of interacting molecular vibrational modes promises an expanded role of the characteristic vibrations to act as spectroscopic markers. In addition to the intrinsic, inter-mode and extrinsic, cavity-mediated inter-mode delocalization, the vibrational modes undergo multiscale relaxation due to reservoir vibrations. Two complementary coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques are presented, which reveal the dynamical nature of the mode correlations in the presence relaxation. Simulations are presented for finite laser pulses. The chosen cavity-vibron mode coupling strengths fall within the range of inter-vibrational mode coupling, hinting at a parameter regime where vibrational energy dispersal can be controlled. It is highlighted that the cavity manipulation of vibrational double excitations, namely, overtone and combination states, can offer deeper insights into the collective mode dynamics. These observations set the ground for cavity-controlled spectroscopic investigation of mode-selective dynamics, where localized electromagnetic modes function as an effective few-body coupler of vibrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the motions of macroscopic objects near their quantum mechanical uncertainties has been desired in diverse fields, including fundamental physics, sensing, and transducers. Despite significant progresses in ground-state cooling of a levitated solid particle, realizing non-classical states of its motion has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate quantum squeezing of the motion of a single nanoparticle by rapidly varying its oscillation frequency. We reveal significant narrowing of the velocity variance to $-4.9(1)$~dB of that of the ground state via free-expansion measurements. To quantitatively confirm our finding, we develop a method to accurately measure the displacement of the nanoparticle by referencing an optical standing wave. Our work shows that a levitated nanoparticle offers an ideal platform for studying non-classical states of its motion and paves the way for its applications in quantum sensing, as well as for exploring quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale.</description>

      <title>Lowering Insulator-to-Metal Transition Temperature of Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films via Co-Sputtering, Furnace Oxidation and Thermal Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermochromic vanadium dioxide thin films have attracted much attention recently for constructing variable-emittance coatings upon its insulator-metal phase transition for dynamic thermal control. However, fabrication of high-quality vanadium dioxide thin films in a cost-effective way is still a challenge. In addition, the phase transition temperature of vanadium dioxide is around 68{\deg}C, which is higher than most of terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications. In this study, we report the fabrication and characterization of tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films with lowered phase transition temperatures via co-sputtering, furnace oxidation and thermal annealing processes for wider application needs. The doping is achieved by co-sputtering of tungsten and vanadium targets while the doping level is varied by carefully controlling the sputtering power for tungsten. Doped thin film samples of 30-nm thick with different tungsten atomic concentrations are prepared by co-sputtering onto undoped silicon wafers. Optimal oxidation time of 4 hours is determined to reach full oxidation in an oxygen-rich furnace environment at 300{\deg}C. Systematic thermal annealing study is carried out to find the optimal annealing temperature and time. By using an optical cryostat coupled to an infrared spectrometer, the temperature-dependent infrared transmittance of fully annealed tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide thin films are measured in a wide temperature range from -60{\deg}C to 100{\deg}C. The phase transition temperature is found to decrease at 24.5{\deg}C per at.% of tungsten doping, and the thermal hysteresis between heating and cooling shrinks at 5.5{\deg}C per at.% from the fabricated vanadium dioxide thin films with tungsten doping up to 4.1 at.%.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to topological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great interest across diverse research fields. Notably, realizing skin effects typically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we theoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, non-Hermitian systems with reciprocal couplings and without gain and loss, can nontrivially give rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, featuring helical spin-dependent skin accumulations, dubbed as the ``helical spin skin effect". Specifically, we construct a lattice model with reciprocal dissipative couplings and gauge fields, implemented in circuit metamaterials. Before introducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized spin edge modes and extended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is applied from $0$ to $\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct spin skin effects and their transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical spin skin effects. Furthermore, we show that these effects can be harnessed to realize helical spin-dependent nonreciprocal transmissions. Our findings not only highlight gauge field induced and enriched non-Hermitian topology, but also brings spin-dependent helicity into skin effects and nonreciprocality.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the inner horizon in the analog of rotating BTZ black holes by an improved photon fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to include the inner horizon in the analog of rotating black holes using photon fluids. We find that a vortex beam carrying an improved phase can simulate the rotating BTZ black holes experimentally. In the experiment, we develop a new photon fluid model in a graphene/methanol thermal optical solution, and measure the variation of photon fluid velocity with the radial position using a Fourier plane light spot localization method, while also determining the variation of phonon velocity with the same radial position from the optical vortex intensity distribution. The result provides an extension for the application of optical vortex and a potential possibility for the future experimental exploration about the properties of BTZ black holes and even the anti-de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Incoherent population trapping in quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic emitters transform electronic excitations to photons with unity efficiency. Their development is crucial for both energy-efficient optical interconnects and photonic quantum technologies, but neither rigorous theoretical frameworks nor systematic experimental methods governing deterministic emitters and their identification were so far available. A central -- and seemingly obvious -- assumption underpinning previous works is that the radiative emission probability is proportional to the internal quantum efficiency. Here, we introduce a stochastic model of the decay dynamics in quantum emitters that disproves this assumption and provides a systematic framework for the development of deterministic quantum light sources. Our model agrees with a wide range of experimental findings, including time-resolved spectroscopy, autocorrelation measurements, and saturation spectroscopy, and it also explains a number of hitherto unexplained experiments. For example, our model shows that above-band continuous-wave excitation selects the exciton transitions with the lowest quantum efficiency, which is of direct importance for photonic quantum technologies relying on aligning nanostructures to emitters. We show that the underlying physics is governed by incoherent trapping of the population in metastable states, which has profound consequences for the physics of quantum emitters. Finally, we provide a straightforward experimental protocol for obtaining deterministic emitters.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the second-order coherence function using quantum reservoir and ensemble methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-based approach enhanced by quantum reservoir computing (QRC) to estimate the zero-time second-order correlation function g2(0). Typically, measuring g2(0) requires single-photon detectors and time-correlated measurements. Machine learning may offer practical solutions by training a model to estimate g2(0) solely from average intensity measurements. In our method, emission from a given quantum source is first processed in QRC. During the inference phase, only intensity measurements are used, which are then passed to a software-based decision tree-based ensemble model. We evaluate this hybrid quantum-classical approach across a variety of quantum optical systems and demonstrate that it provides accurate estimates of g2(0). We further extend our analysis to assess the ability of a trained model to generalize beyond its training distribution, both to the same system under different physical parameters and to fundamentally different quantum sources. While the model may yield reliable estimates within specific regimes, its performance across distinct systems is generally limited.</description>

      <title>Atoms in hollow-core fibers: A QED approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline mechanical effects of light-matter interaction inside hollow-core optical fibers. Starting with quantized electromagnetic radiation, we demonstrate how dispersion, mode functions and losses define an open quantum system and how subsequent Langevin equations can be used to predict spatially-dependent vacuum forces. Conceptually, we reveal new, geometry-induced, forces that have no equivalence in unbounded 3-D space and, practically, show how the general spatial dependence can be greatly approximated by free-space Ince-Gaussian modes: such that the forces can be described analytically. By also considering the effects of drive and fluctuations, we provide an extensive overview of both control and cooling within the limitations of a 2-level atomic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show theoretically that the noise due to laser induced backaction acting on a small nanosphere levitated in a standing-wave trap can be considerably reduced by utilising a suitable reflective boundary. We examine the spherical mirror geometry as a case study of this backaction suppression effect, discussing the theoretical and experimental constraints. We study the effects of laser recoil directly, by analysing optical force fluctuations acting on a dipolar particle trapped at the centre of a spherical mirror. We also compute the corresponding measurement imprecision in an interferometric, shot-noise-limited position measurement, using the formalism of Fisher information flow. Our results show that the standing-wave trapping field is necessary for backaction suppression in three dimensions, and they satisfy the Heisenberg limit of detection.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic fields of the hybrid modes of an optical fiber are reformulated using bi-complex mathematics, which leads to simpler expressions relative to those found with the widely used, conventional complex formulation. Generalized expressions for the electromagnetic fields are also found using both formulations for comparative purposes.

      <description>arXiv:2411.02049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that passively mode-locked lasers subject to feedback from a single external cavity can exhibit large timing fluctuations on short time scales despite having a relatively small long-term timing jitter, meaning that the commonly used von Linde and K\'{e}f\'{e}lian techniques of experimentally estimating the timing jitter can lead to large errors in the estimation of the arrival time of pulses. We also show that adding a second feedback cavity of the appropriate length can significantly suppress noise-induced modulations that are present in the single feedback system. This reduces the short time scale fluctuations of the interspike interval time and at the same time improves the variance of the fluctuation of the pulse arrival times on long time scales.</description>

      <title>Rapid wavefront shaping using an optical gradient acquisition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping systems aim to image deep into scattering tissue by reshaping incoming and outgoing light to correct aberrations caused by tissue inhomogeneity However, the desired modulation depends on the unknown tissue structure and therefore its estimation is a challenging time-consuming task. Most strategies rely on coordinate descent optimization, which sequentially varies each modulation parameter and assesses its impact on the resulting image. We propose a rapid wavefront shaping scheme that transitions from coordinate descent to gradient descent optimization, using the same measurement to update all modulation parameters simultaneously. To achieve this, we have developed an analytical framework that expresses the gradient of the wavefront shaping score with respect to all modulation parameters. Although this gradient depends on the unknown tissue structure, we demonstrate how it can be inferred from the optical system's measurements. Our new framework enables rapid inference of wavefront shaping modulations. Additionally, since the complexity of our algorithm does not scale with the number of modulation parameters, we can achieve very high-resolution modulations, leading to better corrections in thicker tissue layers. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in correcting aberrations in a coherent confocal microscope.</description>

      <title>Anti-symmetric chirp transfer in high-energy ultraviolet via four-wave mixing in gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customizing the pulse shaping of femtosecond pulses remains a key challenge in ultrafast optics. Programmable shaping for ultraviolet (UV) pulses is constrained by the transmission properties and damage threshold of the dielectric materials used. As a stepping stone toward overcoming this broad challenge, we demonstrate an anti-symmetric dispersion transfer from near-infrared (NIR) pulses to UV pulses through chirped-four-wave-mixing (CFWM) in argon gas. Positively chirped NIR pulses map quasi-linearly to negatively chirped UV in a gas-filed hollow capillary fiber (HCF), achieving a conversion efficiency exceeding 13%. This approach expands the foundations of UV pulse shaping, enabling broadband frequency conversion by leveraging the large acceptance angle and intrinsically low dispersion of noble gases, rather than relying on conventional nonlinear crystals. Spectro-temporally customizing high-energy, ultrashort UV pulses is a pivotal technique for applications in ultrafast dynamics, high-precision spectroscopy, future nuclear clocks, charged-particle and radiation sources, and industrial microfabrication.</description>

      <title>Electro-optically tunable second-harmonic generation in lithium niobate metasurfaces boosted by Brillouin zone folding induced bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) metasurfaces exhibit remarkable Pockels effect-driven electro-optic tunability, enabling dynamic control of optical responses through external electric fields. When combined with their high second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{2}$), this tunability is projected into the nonlinear landscape, realizing second-harmonic generation (SHG)-dominated functionalities in integrated photonics. However, achieving deep SHG modulation in LN metasurfaces remains challenging due to LN's limited refractive index tunability under practical driving voltage. To address this, we design an air-hole-structured LN metasurface by strategically adjusting air hole positions to induce Brillouin zone folding-enabled bound states in the continuum with ultrahigh quality factors ($Q&gt;10^{4}$). Numerical simulations demonstrate a $2.59\%$ SHG conversion efficiency at 0.1 MW/cm$^{2}$ excitation and a modulation depth exceeding 0.99 under 15 V peak-to-peak voltage ($\Delta V_{\text{pp}}$). This work establishes a compact framework for electrically tunable nonlinear optics, advancing applications in integrated quantum light sources and programmable photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides fabricated by femtosecond laser photolithography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically poled lithium niobate on insulator (PPLNOI) ridge waveguides are critical photonic components for both classical and quantum information processing. However, dry etching of PPLNOI waveguides often generates rough sidewalls and variations in the etching rates of oppositely poled lithium niobate ferroelectric domains, leading a relatively high propagation losses (0.25 - 1 dB/cm), which significantly limits net conversion efficiency and hinders scalable photonic integration. In this work, a low-loss PPLNOI ridge waveguide with a length of 7 mm was fabricated using ultra-smooth sidewalls through photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching followed by high-voltage pulse poling. The average surface roughness was measured at just 0.27 nm, resulting in significantly lower propagation loss compared to dry-etched counterparts. Highly efficient second-harmonic generation was demonstrated with a normalized efficiency of 1742%/(W*cm^2) and an overall efficiency of 750.1%/W (without accounting for propagation loss). The absolute conversion efficiency reached 15.8%, representing a six-fold improvement over the best previously reported values in single-period PPLNOI waveguides without magnesium oxide doping.</description>

Abstract: The transition to smart wearable and flexible optoelectronic devices communicating with each other and performing neuromorphic computing at the edge is a big goal in next-generation optoelectronics. These devices should perform their regular tasks supported by energy-efficient in-memory calculations. Here, we study the response of the CsPbBr$_3$ halide-perovskite single crystal fabricated on the flexible polymer substrate and integrated with the single-walled carbon nanotube thin film electrodes in a lateral geometry. We show both photodetection functions combined with the synaptic functionality in our device under the application of hybrid optoelectrical stimuli. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our device exhibits frequency-dependent bidirectional modification of synaptic weight with a sliding threshold similar to biologically plausible Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro learning. The demonstrated optoelectronic synaptic behavior in halide-perovskite single-crystals opens the opportunity for the development of hybrid organic-inorganic artificial visual systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement often increases quantum measurement schemes' sensitivity. However, we find that in precision measurements with zero-mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed states, entanglement between different paths degrades measurement sensitivity. We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>
