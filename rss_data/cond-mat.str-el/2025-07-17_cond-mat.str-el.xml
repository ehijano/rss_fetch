      <title>Dynamic competition between phason and amplitudon observed by ultrafast multimodal scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the measurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact (trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all within a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multichannel topological Kondo models and their low-temperature conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the multichannel Kondo effect, overscreening of a magnetic impurity by conduction electrons leads to a frustrated exotic ground state. It has been proposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological Cooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) "spin"] and $N$ spinless electron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This intermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative calculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in the large-$N$ limit. However, the conductance at this intermediate fixed point has not been calculated for generic $N$. Using representation theory, we verify the existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the strong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field theory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and conclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the fixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator (LIO). We express the fixed-point conductance in terms of the modular S-matrix of SO($M$) for general $N$, confirming the previous large-$N$ result. We describe the finite-temperature corrections to the conductance by the LIO and find that they are qualitatively different for the cases $N=1$ and $N\geq2$ due to the different fusion outcomes with the current operator. We also compare the multichannel topological Kondo model to the topological symplectic Kondo model.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations reveal sixfold fermions in cubic $\beta$-PtBi$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in high-quality single crystals of cubic $\beta$-PtBi$_2$. In combination with density functional theory calculations, we identify quantum oscillations associated with all Fermi surface sheets predicted by theory. Our results uncover three small electron pockets centered on a sixfold band-touching point located approximately 25 meV below the Fermi level at the $R$ point of the Brillouin zone. These findings firmly establish the presence of sixfold fermions in close proximity to the Fermi energy of $\beta$-PtBi$_2$.</description>

      <title>Fractal Path Strategies for Efficient 2D DMRG Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum magnetism in two spatial dimensions are often constrained by the area law of entanglement entropy, which heavily limits the accessible system sizes in tensor network methods. In this work, we investigate how the choice of mapping from a two-dimensional lattice to a one-dimensional path affects the accuracy of the two-dimensional Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. We systematically evaluate all mappings corresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \cross N$ grid graphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves generally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the commonly used ``snake" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze various locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing high-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our results show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with the advantage increasing with system size.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of anomalous spin dynamics and weak magnetic order in a chiral trillium lattice K2FeSn(PO4)3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trillium lattices, where magnetic ions form a three-dimensional chiral network of corner-sharing equilateral triangular motifs, offer a prominent platform to explore exotic quantum states. In this work, we report ground-state properties of the $S$ = 5/2 trillium lattice compound K$_{2}$FeSn(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ through thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), and muon spin relaxation (${\mu}$SR) experiments. Thermodynamic and ESR measurements reveal the two-step evolution of magnetic correlations across $T^{*}$ = 11 K, which results from an interplay between dominant antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions and subleading interactions. Below $T^{*}$, \textit{dc} and \textit{ac} magnetic susceptibilities indicate weak \textcolor{black}{magnetic ordering} at $T_{\rm N} \approx 2$ K under low fields, which is suppressed for $\mu_{0}H \geq 2$ T, consistent with a power-law dependence of magnetic specific heat at low temperatures. $\mu$SR experiments confirm the dominance of persistent spin dynamics and the absence of conventional spin freezing, supporting the subtle nature of weak magnetic ordering coexisting with spin-liquid-like fluctuations. These findings underscore the potential for realizing a classical spin-liquid ground state with exotic excitations in high-spin trillium lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Symmetry and Phase Transitions on the Domain Wall of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) domain wall of 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological orders is studied theoretically. The Ising domain wall model is shown to have an emergent SU(2)$_{1}$ conformal symmetry because of a hidden nonsymmorphic octahedral symmetry. While a weak magnetic field is an irrelevant perturbation to the bulk topological orders, it induces a domain wall transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a ferromagnetic order, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry on the domain wall. Moreover, the gapless domain wall state also realizes a 1D topological quantum critical point between a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T}$-symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase, thus demonstrating the holographic construction of topological transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several generalizations of the recently proposed combinatorial summation of Feynman diagrams with more interaction vertices and symmetry-broken cases. For $m$ interaction vertices, we reduce the exponential base in complexity from $3m$ to $m+2$. The generalizations encompass many models of significant physical interest, including the SU(4) Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice, spinless fermions with frustrated interactions, SU(2) Hubbard model on Kagome lattices, \textit{etc}.</description>

      <title>Phonon spectrum in the spin-Peierls phase of CuGeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12409v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CuGeO$_3$ has long been studied as a prototypical example of the spin-Peierls transition in a $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain. Despite intensive investigation of this quasi-one-dimensional material, systematic measurements and calculations of the phonon excitations in the dimerized phase have not to date been possible, leaving certain aspects of the spin-Peierls phenomenon unresolved. We perform state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compute the electronic structure and phonon dynamics in the low-temperature dimerized phase. We also perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to measure the full phonon spectrum over multiple Brillouin zones. We find excellent agreement between our numerical and experimental results that extend to all measurement temperatures. Notable features of our phonon spectra include a number of steeply dispersive modes, nonmonotonic dispersion features, and specific phonon anticrossings, which we relate to the mode eigenvectors. By calculating the magnetic interactions within DFT and studying the effects of different phonon modes on the superexchange paths, we discuss the possibility of observing spin-phonon hybridization effects in experiments performed both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon-dominated charge-density-wave fluctuations in TiSe$_2$ accessed by ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1T-TiSe$_2$ exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition below 200 K, which is believed to be driven by a hybrid exciton-phonon mechanism, making it a versatile platform for investigating the interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Although the corresponding band structure modifications below the CDW transition temperature are well established, only a few reports discuss the occurrence of the CDW fluctuating phase and its spectral features well above the transition temperature. Here, we report the direct observation of spectral features associated with CDW fluctuations at 295 K, using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy. We investigated the transient melting and recovery of CDW fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the coherent amplitude mode modulating the ultrafast CDW recovery persists at these elevated temperatures. The time-, energy- and momentum-resolved photoemission data supported by density functional perturbation theory further confirm that CDW fluctuations at these elevated temperatures are dominated by electron-phonon interaction. The analysis of these very localized microscopic fluctuations consequently provides new insights into the complex interplay between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and, therefore, on the nature of this quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer from the multichannel Dyson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have recently presented the multichannel Dyson equation as an alternative to the standard single-channel Dyson equation. While the latter involves a single many-body Green's function, the former uses a multichannel Green's function in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. Quasiparticles and satellites are thus naturally treated on equal footing in the multichannel Dyson equation. To assess the accuracy of our approach we apply it here to the ground- and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer, an exactly solvable model for $H_2$. In particular, we focus on the potential energy surface as well as the corresponding spectral functions and HOMO-LUMO gaps, which are well-known challenges for many-body approximations such as second Born and $GW$. We show that the multichannel Dyson equation gives overall very good results for all properties considered and outperforms both $GW$ and second Born. In particular, the multichannel Dyson equation yields the correct ground-state energy and HOMO-LUMO gap in the dissociation limit contrary to $GW$.</description>

      <title>Nesting-driven ferromagnetism of itinerant electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a model with electrons and holes whose Fermi surfaces are perfectly nested. The fermions are assumed to be interacting, both with each other and with the lattice. To suppress inhomogeneous states, a sufficiently strong long-range Coulomb repulsion is included into the model. Using the mean field approximation, one can demonstrate that in the absence of doping, the ground state of such a model is insulating and possesses a density-wave order, either SDW, or CDW. Upon doping, a finite ferromagnetic polarization emerges. It is argued that the mechanism driving the ferromagnetism is not of the Stoner type. A phase diagram of the model is constructed, and various properties of the ordered phases are studied.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.</description>

      <title>$\nu$-QSSEP: A toy model for entanglement spreading in stochastic diffusive quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and $\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have realized ultra-cold gases in twisted-bilayer optical lattices. We show that interacting bosons in these lattices present a highly non-trivial ground-state physics resulting from the interplay between inter- and intra-layer hopping and interactions. This physics is crucially determined by site clusterization, which we properly take into account by developing a specifically-tailored cluster Gutzwiller approach. Clusterization results in a large variety of different Mott-like phases characterized by typically different occupations of the clusters, and in the appearance of pockets of sites in between which particles can freely move, but which remain disconnected from each other. This peculiar phase, which resembles the well-known Bose glass phase, may occur even for commensurate twist angles and is further enhanced when the twisting is incommensurate. Moreover, in the incommensurate case, the formation of mobility islands may occur even without inter-layer hopping solely due to inter-layer interactions.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable heavy fermion and quantum criticality in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons gives rise to exotic quantum states in condensed matter systems. Two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful platform for engineering heavy fermion states beyond conventional rare-earth intermetallic compounds. While localized and itinerant carriers have been observed in twisted graphene moire systems, direct evidence of their strong coupling--leading to artificial heavy fermion states--has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrically tunable heavy fermion in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, achieved by controlling the Kondo hybridization between localized flatband electrons and itinerant Dirac electrons via a displacement field. Our results reveal a continuous quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to a paramagnetic heavy fermion metal, evidenced by a crossover from logarithmic to quadratic temperature-dependent resistivity, a dramatic enhancement of quasiparticle effective mass, and Fermi surface reconstruction near quantum critical point. This highly tunable platform offers unprecedented control over heavy fermion physics, establishing moire heterostructures as a versatile arena for exploring correlated quantum phases--including potential unconventional superconductivity--in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Phonon-driven multipolar dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17633v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by advances in pump-probe experiments and light-driven phenomena, we theoretically study the impact of pumped and driven phonons in Mott insulators which host multipole moments, thus going beyond conventional dipolar magnetism. As a case study, we examine pseudospin-1/2 Mott insulators hosting quadrupolar and octupolar moments, and investigate the effect of resonantly exciting ${\cal E}_g$ phonon modes which couple linearly to the quadrupoles. We show that this leads to multipolar precession, with the back action resulting in chiral phonon dynamics below the octupolar phase transition. We further explore the impact of a coherent two-phonon Floquet drive, showing that it can be used to `train' octupolar order or even switch its sign on ultrafast timescales. Our results are obtained combining a generalized Monte Carlo code incorporating phonons with molecular dynamics simulations which numerically integrate the coupled spin-phonon equations of motion. Our work shows how phonon-driven dynamics can be used to probe and control hidden orders in solids.</description>

      <title>Perfectly hidden order and Z2 confinement transition in a fully packed monopole liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a variant of spin ice whose degenerate ground states are densely packed monopole configurations. An applied field drives this model through a Z2 confinement transition. This phase change is a variant of the U(1) Kasteleyn transition, but instead of saturated order the system has fluctuations in the confined phase, and shows critical scaling on both sides of the transition. Remarkably, the magnetic response scales with the critical exponent of the specific heat in the 3D Ising universality class. We prove this universality using a Kramers--Wannier duality to map to an Ising model. The dual order parameter maps back to a non-local string order parameter in the original model, invisible to any local probe. Further, we describe the transition in terms of a bosonic field theory including a pairing term.</description>

      <title>$SU(N)$ spin-phonon simulations of Floquet dynamics in spin $S &gt; 1/2$ Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of magnetic moments coupled to phonons is of great interest for understanding spin transport in solids as well as for our ability to control magnetism via tailored phonon modes. For spin $S &gt; 1/2$, spin-orbit coupling permits an unusual linear coupling of phonons to quadrupolar moments, so that phonons act as a dynamical transverse field for the spins. Here, we develop a generalized $SU(N)$ spin-phonon Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics technique to simulate the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of such spin-orbital-phonon coupled Mott insulators, and apply it to a spin-1 model with competing XY antiferromagnet (AFM) and quadrupolar paramagnet (QPM) phases which is relevant to the Mott insulator $\rm{Ba_2FeSi_2O_7}$. We uncover a rich variety of dynamical phenomena in this system induced by linear or chiral phonon drives, including the generation of a uniform magnetization in the QPM and AFM, strengthening of N\'eel order and gapping of the AFM Nambu-Goldstone mode by Floquet-Ising anisotropy, a non-equilibrium QPM to AFM transition, and creation of Floquet copies of transverse and longitudinal spin waves. Our work is relevant for driven spin-1 magnets, such as $\rm{Ba_2FeSi_2O_7}$, and we highlight broader implications for nonequilibrium multipolar magnetism.</description>

      <title>Edge-Edge Correlations without Edge-States: $\eta$-clustering State as Ground State of the Extended Attractive SU(3) Hubbard Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the extended attractive SU($3$) Hubbard chain with two-body hopping and nearest-neighbor attraction at half-filling. In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Random Transverse Field Effects on Magnetic Noise in Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental developments in non-Kramers spin ice materials and the unclear role of disorder therein, we study the impact of random transverse fields on the dynamics of correlated magnetic systems. We model the effect of dilute, randomly placed transverse fields on quantities such as magnetic noise/susceptibility and the diffusivity of topological excitations. We consider a random ferromagnetic Ising chain (RTFIC) as well as three-dimensional spin ice. At low temperatures, both exhibit (sub-)diffusive defect dynamics, i.e., of domain walls and magnetic monopoles, respectively. Introducing sparse transverse fields leads to the emergence of an additional timescale on the order of the single-spin flip time. We develop a Lindbladian framework that combines Monte Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization which allows us to characterize the dynamics and develop an analytical understanding of the phenomenon. This framework can be benchmarked in detail for the RTFIC. Our findings provide insights into the magnetization dynamics of disordered non-Kramers oxides, such as oxygen-diluted Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and offer a framework for interpreting experimental observations in these systems.</description>

Abstract: The inelastic neutron scattering results and their analysis unequivocally point to a dominant Kitaev interaction in the honeycomb-lattice cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. Our anisotropic-exchange model closely describes $all$ available neutron scattering data in the material's field-polarized phase. The density-matrix renormalization group results for our model are in close accord with the unusual double-zigzag magnetic order and the low in-plane saturation field of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Spin bond order driven by extended repulsive interactions in doped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG) to study many-body instabilities of correlated electrons in graphene doped near the van Hove singularity (VHS). The system is described by an extended Hubbard model including several Coulomb repulsions between neighboring sites. With the repulsion parameters, which turn out to be suitable for low-energy consideration of graphene, we find a spin-bond-order phase in the vicinity of the VHS. This phase gives way to a spin-density-wave phase when involving a weak additional screening. The ground-state phase diagram is presented in the space of the doping level and the screening parameter. We describe in detail both of these spin-ordered states by using recently developed TUFRG + MF scheme, i.e., a combined approach of TUFRG and mean-field (MF) theory. The collinear states are energetically preferable in both cases of the spin bond order and the spin-density wave. But if the third-nearest-neighbor hopping is absent, these spin orders become chiral. The band structures of two collinear spin-ordered states are presented, revealing the metallic behavior of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Topological Transitions in Orbital-Symmetry-Controlled Chemical Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological band theory has transformed our understanding of crystalline materials by classifying the connectivity and crossings of electronic energy levels. Extending these concepts to molecular systems has therefore attracted significant interest. Reactions governed by orbital symmetry conservation are ideal candidates, as they classify pathways as symmetry-allowed or symmetry-forbidden depending on whether molecular orbitals cross along the reaction coordinate. However, the presence of strong electronic correlations in these reactions invalidate the framework underlying topological band theory, preventing direct generalization. Here, we introduce a formalism in terms of Green's functions to classify orbital symmetry controlled reactions even in the presence of strong electronic correlations. Focusing on prototypical 4$\pi$ electrocyclizations, we show that symmetry-forbidden pathways are characterized by crossings of Green's function zeros, in stark contrast to the crossings of poles as predicted by molecular-orbital theory. We introduce a topological invariant that identifies these symmetry protected crossings of both poles and zeros along a reaction coordinate and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be extended to reactions involving different spin states or excited states.</description>

      <title>Interplay of short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal. Compared with antiferromagnetic topological material EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M=Zn, Cd; X=P, As), the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ features an additional ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar units. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layer exhibit significant anisotropic displacement parameters with a space group of P63/mmc. Meanwhile, scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment demonstrates the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers. Concerning the triangular Gd$^{3+}$ layer, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$$(T)$ and heat capacity measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K. Below T$_N$, the in-plane $\chi$$(T)$ is nearly 4 times the $\chi$$(T)$ along $c$ axis, indicative of strong magnetic anisotropy. The Curie Weiss fitting to the low temperature $\chi$$(T)$ data reveals ferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = 5.2 K) in ab-plane, and antiferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = -1 K) along c axis, suggesting the ground state as an A-type antiferromagnetic order. Correspondingly, the density function theory calculation shows that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap 0.27 eV, supported by the resistivity measurement on polycrystal sample. Interestingly, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibits metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely associated with the observation of interstitial P atoms mentioned above. Therefore, our results establish GdZn$_3$P$_3$ system as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism in the two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study line defects in the fermionic CFTs in the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class in dimensions $2&lt;d&lt;4$. These CFTs may be described as the IR fixed points of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) model in $d=4-\epsilon$, or as the UV fixed points of the Gross-Neveu (GN) model, which can be studied using the large $N$ expansion in $2&lt;d&lt;4$. These models admit natural line defects obtained by integrating over a line either the scalar field in the GNY description, or the fermion bilinear operator in the GN description. We compute the beta function for the defect RG flow using both the epsilon expansion and the large $N$ approach, and find IR stable fixed points for the defect coupling, thus providing evidence for a non-trivial IR DCFT. We also compute some of the DCFT observables at the fixed point, and check that the $g$-function associated with the circular defect is consistent with the $g$-theorem for the defect RG flow.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase and loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including transversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we introduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. As an application, we consider simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth for a single time step from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ while retaining a site count of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, implying a linear-in-$N$ end-to-end gate depth for simulating materials, as opposed to quadratic in previous approaches. We also introduce a fermion-inspired qubit algorithm with $O(\mathrm{log}(N)$ depth, but a prohibitive number of additional ancilla qubits. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained dynamics of entanglement in non-integrable quenches far across the Ising quantum critical point</title>

Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding various aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields and partly motivated by the practice of site-resolved control in contemporary ultracold experiments, we present numerical observations of several $\textit{fine-grained}$ (small-subsystem level) features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view, induced by quantum quenches far across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferro-magnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for three-spin and bigger subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local mutual information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.</description>
