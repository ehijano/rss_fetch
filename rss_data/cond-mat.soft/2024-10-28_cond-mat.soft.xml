      <title>Complexity and nonlinearity of colloid electrical transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the complexity and nonlinearity of seven different colloidal suspensions-Au, ferrofluid, TiO2}, ZnO, g-C3N4, MXene, and PEDOT:PSS-when electrically stimulated with fractal, chaotic, and random binary signals. The recorded electrical responses were analyzed using entropy, file compression, fractal dimension, and Fisher information measures to quantify complexity. The nonlinearity introduced by each colloid was evaluated by the deviation of the output from the best-fit hyperplane of the input-output mapping. The results showed that TiO2 was the most complex colloid across all inputs, exhibiting high entropy, poor compressibility, and an unpredictable response pattern. The colloids also exhibited significant nonlinearity, making them promising candidates for reservoir computation, where the mapping of inputs into high-dimensional nonlinear states is advantageous. This study provides insight into the dynamics of colloids and their potential for unconventional computational applications that exploit their inherent complexity and nonlinearity, and it provides a rapid method for assessing the suitability of a particular material for use as a computational substrate before others.</description>

      <title>Combined concurrent Physical and Chemical model for accelerated weathering damages of polyurethane-based coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paints and coatings undergo a variety of physical and chemical changes under environmental exposures. Accurate prediction of these changes is important for the applications of coatings. This work presents a novel approach to modeling accelerated weathering of coating by combining concurrent physical and chemical processes. The model integrates key factors influencing coating degradation and employs a multi-scale framework to capture macro-scale physical changes and micro-level chemical transformations. The chemical component/model simulates photo-degradation reactions using kinetic equations, while the physical component uses Monte Carlo simulations where repeated random events develop surface erosion. The surface topography and chemistry of coating is generated statistically through the physical model. The variations in surface topography and chemistry of coating are correlated with the chemical changes from the chemical model, resulting in estimation of both physical and chemical changes in the coating during real accelerated weathering time. Results demonstrate accurate predictions of chemistry changes, surface degradation profiles, roughness, gloss loss, and relative fracture toughness, which are validated successfully with the experimentally available data. This integrated approach provides insight into coating failure mechanisms, enabling accurate service life prediction, and serve as a tool for formulating durable coatings and optimizing testing protocols.</description>

      <title>Microscopic dynamics of collective acoustic excitations in simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we systematically investigate the microscopic dynamics of collective vibrational excitations in simple liquids. The thermodynamic states of simple liquids are unified to the mean atomic free volume. Our results show that longitudinal acoustic collective vibrational excitations are always observed in simple liquids even when the liquids are viscous, in which the atomic free volume is larger than the cross point of the corresponding mean propagation length and the atomic diffusion limit. This is because some long-wavelength longitudinal acoustic collective vibrational excitations can still propagate in viscous liquids. However, transverse acoustic collective vibrational excitations in viscous liquids become localized since both short- and long-wavelength transverse acoustic collective vibrational excitations have propagation lengths smaller than the atomic diffusion limit. Therefore, transverse acoustic collective vibrational excitations may not be detected in simple liquids. The propagation length of macroscopic elastic and shear waves which are the mechanical response of long-wavelength longitudinal and transverse collective vibrational excitations, respectively, is further calculated to quickly determine the propagation-to-localization crossover of collective vibrational excitations in simple liquids. Our findings here advance the understanding of the microscopic dynamics of collective vibrational excitations in simple liquids.</description>

      <title>Ionic Selectivity of Nanopores: Comparison among Cases under the Hydrostatic Pressure, Electric Field, and Concentration Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionic selectivity of nanopores is crucial for the energy conversion based on nanoporous membranes. It can be significantly affected by various parameters of nanopores and the applied fields driving ions through porous membranes. Here, with finite element simulations, the selective transport of ions through nanopores is systematically investigated under three common fields, i.e. the electric field (V), hydrostatic pressure (p), and concentration gradient (C). For negatively charged nanopores, through the quantitative comparison of the cation selectivity (t+) under the three fields, the cation selectivity of nanopores follows the order of t+V &gt; t+c &gt; t+p. This is due to the transport characteristics of cations and anions through the nanopores. Because of the strong transport of counterions in electric double layers under electric fields and concentration gradients, the nanopore exhibits a relatively higher selectivity to counterions. We also explored the modulation of t+ on the properties of nanopores and solutions. Under all three fields, t+ is directly proportional to the pore length and surface charge density, and inversely correlated to the pore diameter and salt concentration. Under both the electric field and hydrostatic pressure, t+ has almost no dependence on the applied field strength or ion species, which can affect t+ in the case of the concentration gradient. Our results provide detailed insights into the comparison and regulation of ionic selectivity of nanopores under three fields which can be useful for the design of high-performance devices for energy conversion based on nanoporous membranes.</description>

      <title>Crystal melting influenced by particle cooperativity of the liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a universal relation between the thermal expansion coefficient of glasses $\alpha_g$, their glass-transition temperature Tg, and the so-called fragility index m of the corresponding supercooled liquid state was found to be valid for more than 200 glass formers, namely $\alpha_g/m\propto 1/T_g$ [P. Lunkenheimer et al., Nat. Phys. 19, 694 (2023)]. Here we show that this could also have far-reaching consequences for our understanding of crystal melting. Namely, when considering the empirically founded 2/3-rule, stating that the ratio of Tg and the melting temperature Tm is about 2/3 for almost all materials, for crystals a similar relation, $\alpha_c/m\propto 1/T_m$, should apply. Indeed, we find that the available experimental data are well consistent with such a relation. This implies that the melting of a crystal into an ordinary (non-supercooled) liquid is influenced by the fragility, a property quantifying the non-Arrhenius dynamics in the supercooled-liquid state of the material. We argue that this can be explained by a significant enhancement of the "ideal" (non-cooperative) melting temperature arising from the cooperativity of the particle motion in the liquid state above Tm. Therefore, a reassessment of the currently widely accepted microscopic understanding of crystal melting, still founded on the general ideas that lead to the time-honored Lindemann melting criterion, may be necessary.</description>

      <title>Revealing Molecular Mechanism of Nonmonotonic Relationship between Antifreeze Activity and Chain Length in Polyprolines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of polymers generally increases with chain length. However, for polyproline (PPro), a highly potent cryoprotectant, the IRI activity varies nonmonotonically with the degree of polymerization (DP), i.e., DP=8 (P8) &gt; DP=15 (P15) &gt; DP=3 (P3). Herein, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism behind this nonmonotonic effect in PPro. Our findings indicate that the population of the PPII helix structure, which increases with DP, is not the primary reason for this effect. Instead, both single-molecule conformation and multi-molecule aggregation play critical roles. At the single-molecule level, PPro exhibits two types of thermodynamically stable conformations:linear (L) and coil (C), with the latter demonstrating enhanced IRI potency due to its stronger hydrophobicity and ice-binding capability. Notably, P8 has a higher content of the C conformation compared to P15, accounting for its superior IRI activity. Aligning with the conventional understandings, P3's lowest activity stems from its excessively small volume/coverage area on the ice surface. At the multi-molecule level, P15 shows a significantly higher tendency to aggregate than P8, which limits the ability of PPro molecules to fully spread at the ice-water interface and reduces their effective coverage of the ice surface, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. And P15's aggregation becomes significantly pronounced at high concentrations, amplifying the nonmonotonic effect. This work provides an atomistic insight into the nonmonotonic relationship between IRI activity and DP in PPro, offering valuable insights for the rational design of novel biocompatible antifreeze polymers.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bending Boundary Layer: the $\lambda$-test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanics of two ribbons bound at one end and pulled apart at the other ends. We observe the development of a boundary layer at their junction and provide simple analytical expressions for its geometry. Remarkably, the ratio of the bending stiffnesses fully prescribes its shape independently of the pulling force. Our results challenge the standard assumption of neglecting bending stiffness of thin shells at large tensile loading. In addition, we show how the rotational stiffness of the structure exhibits a non-linear but universal behavior. Our findings are relevant to a number of systems where slender structures such as rods and plates are coupled and provide a straightforward method for measuring stiffness of thin membranes.</description>

      <title>Behavior of water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in cylindrical silica pores: A wide temperature range molecular dynamics simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here a molecular dynamics simulation study on water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in 1.6 nm cylindrical pores of silica to investigate a dynamical cross-over, observed earlier experimentally, wherein LiCl slows down confined water at high temperatures but makes it faster at lower temperatures. The cross-over observed in the experiments is reproduced in the simulations, albeit at lower temperature. Moreover, the cross-over encompasses all aspects of dynamics including translation as well as rotation. Both addition of LiCl and confinement result in a breaking of hydrogen bond network in confined water, eliminating the need for long jumps via exchange of hydrogen bonded partner molecules. This lowers the activation energy for diffusion in the electrolyte solution compared to pure confined water and leads to the dynamical cross-over seen at lower temperatures. Our results thus provide an explanation to the experimentally observed phenomena and provide important insights on the interplay of confinement, temperature and presence of electrolytes on the dynamical behavior of nano-confined water.</description>

      <title>Arrested development and traveling waves of active suspensions in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particles in anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids experience competing stresses which guide their trajectories. An aligned suspension of particles can trigger a hydrodynamic bend instability, but the elasticity of the fluid can drive particle orientations back towards alignment. To study these competing effects, we examine a dilute suspension of active particles in an Ericksen-Leslie model nematic liquid crystal. For small active Ericksen number or particle concentration the suspension settles to an equilibrium state with uniform alignment. Beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle concentration the suspension instead can buckle into a steady flowing state. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling state observed in isotropic fluids, however, the development is arrested by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber emerge at yet higher values of active Ericksen number. If the active particles are motile, traveling waves emerge, including a traveling, oscillatory `thrashing' state. Moment equations are derived, compared to kinetic theory simulations, and analyzed in asymptotic limits which admit exact expressions for the traveling wave speed and both particle orientation and director fields in the arrested state.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the superposition of incremental frictional surface tractions that, in the case of an incompressible elastic half-space, correspond to a rigid tangential translation of a circular contact domain, the stress and displacement fields in the surface are determined in closed analytic form for an elastic half-space under the action of a constant shear traction over a circular contact domain on the surface. The obtained exact solutions can serve as benchmarks for numerical models, or can be used for the deeper contact-mechanical analysis of adhesive sliding contacts of soft materials.</description>

      <title>Vapour-Liquid equilibrium and low-temperature liquid-crystal phase diagram of discotic colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discotic colloids give rise to a paradigmatic family of liquid crystals with sound applications in Materials Science. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulations are employed to characterize the low-temperature liquid crystal phase diagram and the vapour-liquid coexistence of discotic colloids interacting via a Kihara potential. Discoidal particles with thickness-diameter aspect ratios $L^*\equiv L/D$=\,0.5, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 are considered. For the less anisotropic particles ($L^*$$\ge$0.2), coexistence of a vapour phase with the isotropic fluid and with the columnar liquid crystal phase is observed. As the particle anisotropy increases, the vapour-liquid coexistence shifts to lower temperatures and its density range diminishes, eventually merging with coexistences involving the liquid crystal phases. The $L^*=$\,0.1 fluid displays a rich sequence of mesophases, including a nematic phase and a novel lamellar phase in which particles arrange in layers perpendicular to the nematic director.</description>

      <title>Confined active particles with spatially dependent Lorentz force: an odd twist to the "best Fokker-Planck approximation"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a version of the so-called "best Fokker-Planck approximation" (BFPA) to describe the spatial properties of interacting active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) in arbitrary spatial dimensions. In doing so, we also take into account the odd-diffusive contribution of the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a spatially dependent magnetic field, sticking to the overdamped limit. While the BFPA itself does not turn out to be widely useful, our general approach allows to deduce an appropriate generalization of the Fox approximation, which we use to characterize the stationary behavior of a single active particle in an external potential by deriving analytic expressions for configurational probability distributions (or effective potentials). In agreement with computer simulations, our theory predicts that the Lorentz force reduces the effective attraction and thus the probability to find an active particle in the vicinity of a repulsive wall. Even for an inhomogeneous magnetic field, our theoretical findings provide useful qualitative insights, specifically regarding the location of accumulation regions.</description>

      <title>Molecular Fingerprints of Ice Surfaces in Sum Frequency Generation Spectra: a First Principles Machine Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level structure and dynamics of ice surfaces is crucial for deciphering several chemical, physical, and atmospheric processes. Vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is the most prominent tool for probing the molecular-level structure of the air--ice interface as it is a surface-specific technique, but the molecular interpretation of SFG spectra is challenging. This study utilizes a machine-learning potential, along with dipole and polarizability models trained on ab initio data, to calculate the SFG spectrum of the air--ice interface. At temperatures below ice surface premelting, our simulations support the presence of a proton-ordered arrangement at the Ice Ih surface, similar to that seen in Ice XI. Additionally, our simulations provide insight into the assignment of SFG peaks to specific molecular configurations where possible and assess the contribution of subsurface layers to the overall SFG spectrum. These insights enhance our understanding and interpretation of vibrational studies of environmental chemistry at the ice surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic crystals with dislocations deform plastically at low stresses via dislocation glide. Whether dislocation glide occurs in macroscopic frictional granular media has remained unknown. The discrete element method is employed to simulate the structural and mechanical responses of a granular crystal with an edge dislocation. We find that dislocation glide occurs at low interparticle friction, resulting in significantly lower yield stresses than in dislocation-free crystals. Yield stress varies linearly with interparticle friction, attributed to both Peierls stress and frictional effect.</description>

Abstract: We study nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic theories with charge and energy conservation in and above two dimensions that describe the large-scale behavior of the Hamiltonian XY model in the disordered and ordered phases. Using renormalization group analysis at one-loop order, we show that while Fourier's law holds in the ordered phase above two dimensions and in the disordered phase in any dimension, the energy diffusivity in the ordered phase exactly in two dimensions, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase, exhibits a logarithmic divergence in the thermodynamic limit. This divergence arises from elastic energy transport induced by spin-wave excitations.</description>

      <title>A twenty-first century statistical physics of life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular biology revolution of the last seventy five years has transformed our view of living systems. Scientific explanations of biological phenomena are now synonymous with the identification of the genes, proteins, and signaling molecules involved. The hegemony of the molecular paradigm has only become more pronounced as new technologies allow us to make measurements at scale. Combining this wealth of data with new ``artificial intelligence'' techniques is viewed as the future of biology. Here, we challenge this emerging ``common sense'', laying out a roadmap for developing a theoretical understanding of life. We argue that a twenty-first century theoretical biology must be founded on a new type of statistical physics suited to the living world. Rather than merely constructing statistical models, a statistical theory requires developing ``quantitative abstractions'' for understanding the gene-organism-environment triad. This necessitates overcoming four major challenges that distinguish living matter: (1) living systems are composed of a large number of heterogeneous parts rather than a large number of identical objects; (2) living systems control and manipulate the physical world in a manner that is extremely different from the ways considered in traditional statistical physics; (3) living systems necessarily operate out of equilibrium; (4) living systems are evolved objects with a function, resulting in new types of constraints that must be imposed on probabilistic ensembles. We conclude by discussing a few key themes that we view as promising directions for developing a statistical physics of life: typicality, localized biological control, a linear response of complex systems with non-reciprocal interactions, biological resource allocation, and learning and adaptation in overparameterized systems.</description>

      <title>A steady-state frictional crack in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analogy between frictional cracks, propagating along interfaces in frictional contact, and ordinary cracks in bulk materials is important in various fields. We consider a stress-controlled frictional crack propagating at a velocity $c_{\rm r}$ along an interface separating two strips, each of height $H$, the frictional counterpart of the classical problem of a displacement-controlled crack in a strip, which played central roles in understanding material failure. We show that steady-state frictional cracks in a strip geometry require a nonmonotonic dependence of the frictional strength on the slip velocity and, in sharp contrast to their classical counterparts, feature a vanishing stress drop. Here, rupture is driven by energy flowing to its edge from behind, generated by an excess power of the external stress, and to be accompanied by an increase in the stored elastic energy, in qualitative contrast to the classical counterpart that is driven by the release of elastic energy stored ahead of the propagating edge. Finally, we derive a complete set of mesoscopic and macroscopic scaling relations for frictional cracks in a strip geometry and demonstrate that the stress singularity near their edges is proportional to $(\Delta{v}/c_{\rm r})\sqrt{H}$, where $\Delta{v}$ is the slip velocity rise accompanying their propagation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of non-Markovian systems: Markovian embedding vs effective mass approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of non-Markovian systems is a classic problem yet it attracts an everlasting activity in physics and beyond. A powerful tool for modeling such setups is the Generalized Langevin Equation, however, its analysis typically poses a major challenge even for numerical means. For this reason, various approximations have been proposed over the years that simplify the original model. In this work we compare two methods allowing to tackle this great challenge: (i) the well-known and successful Markovian embedding technique and (ii) the recently developed effective mass approach. We discuss their scope of applicability, numerical accuracy, and computational efficiency. In doing so we consider a paradigmatic model of a free Brownian particle subjected to power-law correlated thermal noise. We show that when the memory time is short, the effective mass approach offers satisfying precision and typically is much faster than the Markovian embedding. Moreover, the concept of effective mass can be used to find optimal parameters allowing to reach supreme accuracy and minimal computational cost within the embedding. Our work therefore provides a blueprint for investigating the dynamics of non-Markovian systems.</description>

      <title>Origami crawlers: exploring a single origami vertex for complex path navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ancient art of origami, traditionally used to transform simple sheets into intricate objects, also holds potential for diverse engineering applications, such as shape morphing and robotics. In this study, we demonstrate that one of the most basic origami structures (i.e., a rigid, foldable degree-four vertex) can be engineered to create a crawler capable of navigating complex paths using only a single input. Through a combination of experimental studies and modeling, we show that modifying the geometry of a degree four vertex enables sheets to move either in a straight line or turn. Furthermore, we illustrate how leveraging the nonlinearities in folding allows the design of crawlers that can switch between moving straight and turning. Remarkably, these crawling modes can be controlled by adjusting the range of the actuation folding angle. Our study opens avenues for simple machines that can follow intricate trajectories with minimal actuation.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Stress-Structure Self-Organization in Granular Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During quasi-static dynamics of granular systems, the stress and structure self-organise, but there is currently no quantitative measure or understanding of this phenomenon. Such an understanding is essential because local structural properties of the settled material are then correlated with the local stress, which calls into question existing linear theories of stress transmission in granular media. A method to quantify the local stress-structure correlations is necessary for addressing this issue and we present here such a method for planar systems. We then use it to analyze numerically several different systems, compressed quasi-statically by two different procedures. We define cells, cell orders, cell orientations, and cell stresses and report the following results. 1. Cells orient along the local stress major principal axes. 2. The mean ratio of cell principal stresses decreases with cell order and increases with friction. 3. The ratio distributions collapse onto a single curve under a simple scaling, for all packing protocols and friction coefficients. 4. A constructed model explains the correlations between the local cell and stress principal axis orientations. 5. The collapse of the stress ratios onto a Weibull distribution is explained theoretically. Our results quantify the cooperative stress-structure self-organization and provide a way to relate quantitatively the stress-structure coupling to different process parameters and particle characteristics. Significantly, the strong stress-structure correlation, driven by structural re-organization upon application of external stress, suggests that current stress theories of granular matter need to be revisited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A host of elastic systems consisting of active components exhibit path-dependent elastic behaviors not found in classical elasticity, which is known as odd elasticity. Odd elasticity is characterized by antisymmetric (odd) elastic modulus tensor. Here, from the perspective of geometry, we construct the Hamiltonian formalism to show the origin of the antisymmetry of the elastic modulus that is intrinsically anisotropic. Furthermore, both non-conservative stress and the associated nonlinear constitutive relation naturally arise. This work also opens the promising possibility of exploring the physics of odd elasticity in dynamical regime by Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of the Translational Immobilization of Water Molecules Under Nanoscale Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ODNP (Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization) detects an experimental measurable associated directly with translational motion of water at the nanoscale, a quantity that few other methods can detect. This study offers a unique insight into the translational diffusion of water inside RMs (reverse micelles). It finds that simply adjusting the "water loading" ($w_0$, i.e. the mole ratio of surfactant to water) to tune the size of the RMs achieves a near-continuous tuning of the translational diffusion of water. Furthermore, (1) water molecules in the core of relatively large RMs ($w_0=10$, diameter of water nanopool $\approx 3.5$ nm) diffuse only as fast as those on the surface of a lipid bilayer and (2) surprisingly, translational diffusion slows to a near-stop for RMs that are small, but still contain hundreds of water molecules in their core. Extrapolation to larger sized water pools implies that in order to recover bulk-like translational dynamics, tens of thousands of water molecules are required. The data from the small RMs also represent a breakthrough as the first example where a spin probe that is completely exposed to water (as opposed to buried inside a macromolecule) observes dramatic slowing of the translational diffusion.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Characterization of Labyrinthine Pattern Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive approach to characterizing labyrinthine structures that often emerge as a final steady state in pattern forming systems. We employ advanced machine learning based pattern recognition techniques to identify the types and locations of topological defects of the local stripe ordering. Applying this method to single-crystal Bi-substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet films, we uncover a distinct morphological transition between two zero-field labyrinthine structures. Crucially, the pair distribution functions of the topological defects reveal subtle differences between labyrinthine structures which are beyond conventional characterization methods. By systematically analyzing the spatial correlations and geometric properties of these defects, we provide new insights into the athermal dynamics governing the observed morphological transitions. Our work demonstrates that machine learning based recognition techniques enable novel studies of rich and complex labyrinthine type structures universal to many pattern formation systems.</description>

      <title>Rigid clusters in shear-thickening suspensions: a nonequilibrium critical transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The onset and growth of rigid clusters in a two-dimensional (2D) suspension in shear flow are studied by numerical simulation. The suspension exhibits the lubricated-to-frictional rheology transition but is studied at stresses above the levels that cause extreme shear thickening. At large solid area fraction, $\phi$, but below the jamming fraction, we find that there is critical $\phi_c$ beyond which the proportion of particles in rigid clusters grows sharply, as $f_{\rm rig} \sim (\phi-\phi_c)^{\beta}$ with $\beta=1/8$, and at which the fluctuations in the net rigidity grow sharply, with a susceptibility measure $\chi_{\rm rig} \sim |\phi-\phi_c|^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 7/4$. By applying finite size scaling, the correlation length, arising from the correlation of rigid domains, is found to scale as $\xi \sim |\phi-\phi_c|^{-\nu}$ with $\nu = 1$. The system is thus found to exhibit criticality, with critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising transition. This behavior occurs over a range of stresses, with $\phi_c$ increasing as the stress decreases, consistent with the known increase in jamming fraction with reduction of stress for shear-thickening suspensions.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Density Scaling: Coarse-Graining in Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of liquids is pivotal for the study of larger spatiotemporal processes, especially in glass-forming materials at low temperatures. Density scaling, observed in many molecular systems through experiments, offers an efficient means for exploring a vast range of time scales along a one-dimensional phase diagram. However, the theoretical foundation provided by isomorph theory is of limited use for molecular systems, since currently no first-principles theory exists that can explain the origins of density scaling or make predictions based on it. In this work, we propose a first-principles framework employing coarse-graining in space and time. Spatial coarse-graining reduces a molecule to a center-of-mass-level description by eliminating fast degrees of freedom, while temporal coarse-graining involves averaging fluctuations or correlation functions over characteristic time scales. We show that both approaches enable ab initio estimation of the density scaling coefficient for ortho-terphenyl, consistent with experimental values. Building on these findings, we employ excess entropy scaling to derive a microscopic theory that underpins density scaling from fully atomistic simulations. Our results illuminate the role of coarse-graining in assessing slow fluctuations in molecules and unravel the microscopic nature of density scaling. Ultimately, our proposed framework enables systematic bottom-up approaches for predicting transport coefficients that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible and computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Crystallization morphology and self-assembly of polyacrylamide solutions during evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the crystallization and self-assembly phenomena of polyacrylamide (PAM) solutions during evaporation. While traditional thin-film fabrication methods such as spin coating and drop casting are commonly used, this study utilizes a simple evaporation approach to gain insights into the self-assembly processes of PAM solutions. We examined PAM solutions with varying concentrations (1%, 2%, and 5%) and observed the resulting crystalline structures and morphological changes during evaporation. Spectroscopic absorbance measurements were employed to analyze concentration gradients and crystallization patterns. The findings reveal that the concentration gradient during evaporation significantly impacts the crystallization behavior of PAM solutions. The 2% solution exhibited the clearest and most regular crystalline patterns, whereas the 1% and 5% solutions displayed more complex and irregular morphologies. These observations provide new insights into how solution concentration influences PAM crystallization, contributing to a better understanding of polymer thin-film self-assembly. The novelty of this study lies in exploring PAM self-assembly through controlled evaporation, offering valuable insights for the development of polymer films.</description>

      <title>Detailed balance in non-equilibrium dynamics of granular matter: derivation and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling the dynamics of dense granular media is a long standing challenge and essential to many natural phenomena and technological applications. Here, we trace back puzzling experimental observation of detailed-balanced steady states to self-organisation of the neighbour probability distribution. The emergence of detailed balance in non-equilibrium granular dynamics could constitute a major step toward better models of granular media, as well as provide more insight into non-equilibrium processes in general. We show analytically that DBSS emerges when a certain neighbour probability is uniform across the system. This condition leads to a conditional cell order distribution being independent of the condition. We then carry out rotational shear experiments, in which this condition is satisfied, and show that they give rise to robust detailed-balanced steady states. We also show that, when the unconditional cell order distribution maximises the entropy, it is determined by a single constant parameter that is characteristic of all cell transitions. These results illustrate the predictive power of recently proposed evolution equations, which pave the way to simpler models of the dynamics of planar granular systems.</description>
