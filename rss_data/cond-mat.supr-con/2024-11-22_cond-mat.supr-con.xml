      <title>THz optical response of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ films analyzed within the three-band Eliashberg s$_\pm $-wave model</title>

Abstract: The uncertainty of the nature of the normal state and superconducting condensate of unconventional superconductors continues to stimulate considerable speculation about the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials. Of particular interest are the type of symmetry of the order parameter and the basic electronic characteristics of the superconducting and normal states. We report the derivation of temperature dependences of the superconducting condensate plasma frequency, superfluid density, and London penetration depth by measuring terahertz spectra of conductivity and dielectric permittivity of the Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ thin films with different Ni concentrations. A comprehensive analysis of the experimental data was performed in the framework of the simple three-band Eliashberg model under the assumption that the superconducting coupling mechanism is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The results of independent experiments support the choice of model parameters. Based on calculations of the temperature dependences of superconducting gaps, we may conclude that the obtained results are compatible with the scenario, in which Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ is a multiband superconductor with s$_\pm $-wave pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Superconducting $p$-wave pairing effects on one-dimensional non-Hermitian quasicrystals with power law hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of superconducting $p$-wave pairing on the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with power-law hopping. For the case of short-range hopping, weak pairing leads to oscillating quasi-Majorana zero modes, turning to edge-localized Majorana zero modes as pairing strength increases. For the case of long-range hopping, we observe the emergence of massive Dirac modes having oscillatory behavior, similar to Majorana modes with weak pairing. The massive Dirac modes localize at the edges as the pairing strength grows. The superconducting pairing spoils the plateaus observed in the fractal dimension of all the energy eigenstates of the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with power-law hopping. The number of plateaus decreases with the increasing pairing strength for the weak non-Hermiticity in the system. The phase diagram of the system reveals that real and complex energy spectrums correlate differently with the localization properties of the eigenstates depending on the strength of pairing and hopping range.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge dynamics in bilayer electron system with long-range Coulomb interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of charge excitations in a bilayer electron system in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRC). Our major point is to derive formulae of the LRC that fully respect the bilayer lattice structure. This is an extension of the LRC obtained by Fetter in the electron-gas model 50 years ago and can now be applicable to any electron density. We then provide general formulae of the charge susceptibility in the random phase approximation and study them numerically. The charge ordering tendency is not found and instead we find two plasmon modes, w_{+} and w_{-} modes. Our second major point is to elucidate their spectral weight distribution and the effect of electron tunneling between the layers. The spectral weight of the w_{+-} modes does not have 2pi periodicity along the q_{z}c direction. The w_{+} mode loses spectral weight at inplane momentum q_{||}=(0,0) at q_{z}c=2n pi with n being integer whereas the w_{-} mode has no spectral weight at q_{z}c=0 for any q_{||} but acquires sizable spectral weight at q_{z}c=2n pi with n \ne 0. Both w_{+-} modes are gapped at q_{||}=(0,0). When q_{z}c is away from 2n pi, the w_{+-} modes show striking behavior. When the intrabilayer hopping t_z is relatively small (large), the w_{-} (w_{+}) mode becomes gapless at q_{||}=(0,0) whereas the w_{+} (w_{-}) mode retains the gap. However, when the interbilayer hopping integral t_{z}' is taken into account, the gapless mode acquires a gap at q_{||}=(0,0) and both w_{+-} modes are gapped at any q_{z}c. To highlight the special feature of the LRC, we also clarify a difference to the case of a short-range interaction. While the strong electron correlation effects are not included, the present theory captures available data of the charge excitations observed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for Y-based cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Certain BCS wavefunctions are quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a method for constructing many-body scar states in fermionic lattice models that incorporate a given type of correlations with one of the states maximizing them over the full Hilbert space. Therefore this state may always be made the ground state by adding such correlations as a "pairing potential" $\delta H_0$ to any Hamiltonian $H=H_0+OT$ supporting group-invariant scars [arXiv:2007.00845]. In case of single-flavour spin-full fermions the ground state is a special case of the BCS wavefunction written in real space and invariant under any site index relabelling. For multi-orbital fermions this state also resembles BCS but includes higher order terms corresponding to "pairing" of more than two fermions. The broad class of eligible Hamiltonians $H$ is well documented [arXiv:2007.00845],[arXiv:2106.10300] and includes many conventional condensed matter interactions. The part of the Hamiltonian $(H_0+\delta H_0)$ that governs the exact dynamics of the scar subspace coincides with the BCS mean-field Hamiltonian. We therefore show that its BCS ground state and the excitations above it are many-body scars that are dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space and thereby protected from thermalization. These states are insensitive to a variety of $OT$ Hamiltonian terms that among others include interactions and (spin-orbit) hoppings. Our results point out a connection between the fields of superconductivity and weak ergodicity breaking (many-body scars) and will hopefully encourage further investigations. They also provide the first practical protocol to initialize a fermionic system to a scar state in (a quantum simulator) experiment.</description>

      <title>Dirac and chiral spin liquids on spin-1/2 square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the challenging problem of identifying the quantum spin liquid candidate in the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. By integrating the Gutzwiller-guided density matrix renormalization group method with analytical analyses, we present clear evidence that the ground state is a Z$_2$ Dirac spin liquid. This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic signatures of a potential Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin Ovchinnikov state in the isotropic superconductor Ti4Ir2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an investigation of the isotropic superconductor Ti4Ir2O, focusing on its magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram near and above the Pauli limit for superconductivity. The data exhibits characteristic features that align with the formation of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, including a deviation of the upper critical field line from the standard WHH model upon approaching the Pauli limiting field and a phase transition line separating the ordinary low-field superconducting phase from an unusual high field superconducting state above the Pauli limit. We discuss why the upper critical field line in this isotropic superconductor can approach the Pauli limit, necessitating a particularly high orbital limit for superconductivity. The research also identifies peculiar features in the specific heat data set taken at 0.6 K, which may be an example of the segmentation of the FFLO phase with multiple q phases. The findings provide an explanation for the violation of the Pauli limit in this superconductor, adding a fully isotropic superconductor to the list of potential FFLO superconductors and providing new insights for contemporary theories of the FFLO state.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the novel type of orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in the bulk limit of 2H-NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03215v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, an unusual superconducting state, defies high magnetic fields beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. It exhibits a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter in real space and is exceptionally rare. Recently, an even more exotic variant - the orbital FFLO state - was predicted and identified in the transition metal dichalcogenide superconductor 2H-NbSe2. This state emerges in thin samples with thicknesses below ~40 nm, at the boundary between two and three dimensions. The complex interplay between Ising spin orbit coupling and the Pauli paramagnetic effect can lead to a stabilization of the FFLO state in a relatively large range of the magnetic phase diagram, even well below the Pauli limit. In this study, we present experimental evidence of the formation of this orbital FFLO state in bulk 2H-NbSe2 samples. This evidence was obtained using high-resolution DC magnetization and magnetic torque experiments in magnetic fields applied strictly parallel to the NbSe2 basal plane. Both quantities display a crossover to a discontinuous first-order superconducting transition at the normal state boundary in magnetic fields of 4 T and above. This is usually seen as a sign that Pauli paramagnetic pair breaking effects affect the superconducting state. The magnetic torque reveals a small step-like reversible anomaly, indicating a magnetic field-induced thermodynamic phase transition within the superconducting state. This anomaly bears many similarities to the FFLO transitions in other FFLO superconductors, suggesting the potential existence of an orbital FFLO state in bulk 2H-NbSe2 samples. Additionally, we observe a pronounced in-plane 6-fold symmetry of the upper critical field in the field range above this phase transition, which has previously been interpreted as a hallmark of the orbital FFLO state in thin 2H-NbSe2.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>
