      <title>Blockchain As a Platform For Artificial Intelligence (AI) Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly complex and autonomous, concerns over transparency and accountability have intensified. The "black box" problem in AI decision-making limits stakeholders' ability to understand, trust, and verify outcomes, particularly in high-stakes sectors such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable, and transparent characteristics, presents a potential solution to enhance AI transparency and auditability. This paper explores the integration of blockchain with AI to improve decision traceability, data provenance, and model accountability. By leveraging blockchain as an immutable record-keeping system, AI decision-making can become more interpretable, fostering trust among users and regulatory compliance. However, challenges such as scalability, integration complexity, and computational overhead must be addressed to fully realize this synergy. This study discusses existing research, proposes a framework for blockchain-enhanced AI transparency, and highlights practical applications, benefits, and limitations. The findings suggest that blockchain could be a foundational technology for ensuring AI systems remain accountable, ethical, and aligned with regulatory standards.</description>

      <title>Life-Cycle Routing Vulnerabilities of LLM Router</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, yet their performance and computational costs vary significantly. LLM routers play a crucial role in dynamically balancing these trade-offs. While previous studies have primarily focused on routing efficiency, security vulnerabilities throughout the entire LLM router life cycle, from training to inference, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation into the life-cycle routing vulnerabilities of LLM routers. We evaluate both white-box and black-box adversarial robustness, as well as backdoor robustness, across several representative routing models under extensive experimental settings. Our experiments uncover several key findings: 1) Mainstream DNN-based routers tend to exhibit the weakest adversarial and backdoor robustness, largely due to their strong feature extraction capabilities that amplify vulnerabilities during both training and inference; 2) Training-free routers demonstrate the strongest robustness across different attack types, benefiting from the absence of learnable parameters that can be manipulated. These findings highlight critical security risks spanning the entire life cycle of LLM routers and provide insights for developing more robust models.</description>

      <title>A Secure Blockchain-Assisted Framework for Real-Time Maritime Environmental Compliance Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maritime industry is governed by stringent environmental regulations, most notably the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Ensuring compliance with these regulations is difficult due to low inspection rates and the risk of data fabrication. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure blockchain-assisted framework for real-time maritime environmental compliance monitoring. By integrating IoT and shipboard sensors with blockchain technology, the framework ensures immutable and transparent record-keeping of environmental data. Smart contracts automate compliance verification and notify relevant authorities in case of non-compliance. A proof-of-concept case study on sulfur emissions demonstrates the framework's efficacy in enhancing MARPOL enforcement through real-time data integrity and regulatory adherence. The proposed system leverages the Polygon blockchain for scalability and efficiency, providing a robust solution for maritime environmental protection. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed blockchain-enhanced compliance monitoring system effectively and securely ensures real-time regulatory adherence with high scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, leveraging the robust capabilities of the Polygon blockchain.</description>

      <title>TH-Bench: Evaluating Evading Attacks via Humanizing AI Text on Machine-Generated Text Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, Machine-Generated Texts (MGTs) have become increasingly fluent, high-quality, and informative. Existing wide-range MGT detectors are designed to identify MGTs to prevent the spread of plagiarism and misinformation. However, adversaries attempt to humanize MGTs to evade detection (named evading attacks), which requires only minor modifications to bypass MGT detectors. Unfortunately, existing attacks generally lack a unified and comprehensive evaluation framework, as they are assessed using different experimental settings, model architectures, and datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce the Text-Humanization Benchmark (TH-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate evading attacks against MGT detectors. TH-Bench evaluates attacks across three key dimensions: evading effectiveness, text quality, and computational overhead. Our extensive experiments evaluate 6 state-of-the-art attacks against 13 MGT detectors across 6 datasets, spanning 19 domains and generated by 11 widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that no single evading attack excels across all three dimensions. Through in-depth analysis, we highlight the strengths and limitations of different attacks. More importantly, we identify a trade-off among three dimensions and propose two optimization insights. Through preliminary experiments, we validate their correctness and effectiveness, offering potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>AuthorMist: Evading AI Text Detectors with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of powerful AI-generated text, automatic detectors have emerged to identify machine-written content. This poses a threat to author privacy and freedom, as text authored with AI assistance may be unfairly flagged. We propose AuthorMist, a novel reinforcement learning-based system to transform AI-generated text into human-like writing. AuthorMist leverages a 3-billion-parameter language model as a backbone, fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GPRO) to paraphrase text in a way that evades AI detectors.
  Our framework establishes a generic approach where external detector APIs (GPTZero, WinstonAI, Originality.ai, etc.) serve as reward functions within the reinforcement learning loop, enabling the model to systematically learn outputs that these detectors are less likely to classify as AI-generated. This API-as-reward methodology can be applied broadly to optimize text against any detector with an accessible interface. Experiments on multiple datasets and detectors demonstrate that AuthorMist effectively reduces the detectability of AI-generated text while preserving the original meaning. Our evaluation shows attack success rates ranging from 78.6% to 96.2% against individual detectors, significantly outperforming baseline paraphrasing methods. AuthorMist maintains high semantic similarity (above 0.94) with the original text while successfully evading detection. These results highlight limitations in current AI text detection technologies and raise questions about the sustainability of the detection-evasion arms race.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Link Network Model for Supporting Traceability of Logistics on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of tracing states of logistic transportations requires an efficient storage and retrieval of the state of logistic transportations and locations of logistic objects. However, the restriction of sharing states and locations of logistic objects across organizations from different countries makes it hard to deploy a centralized database for implementing the traceability in a cross-border logistic system. This paper proposes a semantic data model on Blockchain to represent a logistic process based on the Semantic Link Network model where each semantic link represents a logistic transportation of a logistic object between two parties. A state representation model is designed to represent the states of a logistic transportation with semantic links. It enables the locations of logistic objects to be derived from the link states. A mapping from the semantic links to the blockchain transactions is designed to enable schema of semantic links and states of semantic links to be published in blockchain transactions. To improve the efficiency of tracing a path of semantic links on blockchain platform, an algorithm is designed to build shortcuts along the path of semantic links to enable a query on the path of a logistic object to reach the target in logarithmic steps on the blockchain platform. A reward-penalty policy is designed to allow participants to confirm the state of links on blockchain. Analysis and simulation demonstrate the flexibility, effectiveness and the efficiency of Semantic Link Network on immutable blockchain for implementing logistic traceability.</description>

      <title>Zero-to-One IDV: A Conceptual Model for AI-Powered Identity Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's increasingly digital interactions, robust Identity Verification (IDV) is crucial for security and trust. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming IDV, enhancing accuracy and fraud detection. This paper introduces ``Zero to One,'' a holistic conceptual framework for developing AI-powered IDV products. This paper outlines the foundational problem and research objectives that necessitate a new framework for IDV in the age of AI. It details the evolution of identity verification and the current regulatory landscape to contextualize the need for a robust conceptual model. The core of the paper is the presentation of the ``Zero to One'' framework itself, dissecting its four essential components: Document Verification, Biometric Verification, Risk Assessment, and Orchestration. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this conceptual model and suggesting future research directions focused on the framework's further development and application. The framework addresses security, privacy, UX, and regulatory compliance, offering a structured approach to building effective IDV solutions. Successful IDV platforms require a balanced conceptual understanding of verification methods, risk management, and operational scalability, with AI as a key enabler. This paper presents the ``Zero to One'' framework as a refined conceptual model, detailing verification layers, and AI's transformative role in shaping next-generation IDV products.</description>

      <title>Leaky Batteries: A Novel Set of Side-Channel Attacks on Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in battery technology have accelerated the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) due to their environmental benefits. However, their growing sophistication introduces security and privacy challenges. Often seen as mere operational data, battery consumption patterns can unintentionally reveal critical information exploitable for malicious purposes. These risks go beyond privacy, impacting vehicle security and regulatory compliance. Despite these concerns, current research has largely overlooked the broader implications of battery consumption data exposure. As EVs integrate further into smart transportation networks, addressing these gaps is crucial to ensure their safety, reliability, and resilience. In this work, we introduce a novel class of side-channel attacks that exploit EV battery data to extract sensitive user information. Leveraging only battery consumption patterns, we demonstrate a methodology to accurately identify the EV driver and their driving style, determine the number of occupants, and infer the vehicle's start and end locations when user habits are known. We utilize several machine learning models and feature extraction techniques to analyze EV power consumption patterns, validating our approach on simulated and real-world datasets collected from actual drivers. Our attacks achieve an average success rate of 95.4% across all attack objectives. Our findings highlight the privacy risks associated with EV battery data, emphasizing the need for stronger protections to safeguard user privacy and vehicle security.</description>

      <title>CIPHERMATCH: Accelerating Homomorphic Encryption-Based String Matching via Memory-Efficient Data Packing and In-Flash Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE) allows secure computation on encrypted data without revealing the original data, providing significant benefits for privacy-sensitive applications. Many cloud computing applications (e.g., DNA read mapping, biometric matching, web search) use exact string matching as a key operation. However, prior string matching algorithms that use homomorphic encryption are limited by high computational latency caused by the use of complex operations and data movement bottlenecks due to the large encrypted data size. In this work, we provide an efficient algorithm-hardware codesign to accelerate HE-based secure exact string matching. We propose CIPHERMATCH, which (i) reduces the increase in memory footprint after encryption using an optimized software-based data packing scheme, (ii) eliminates the use of costly homomorphic operations (e.g., multiplication and rotation), and (iii) reduces data movement by designing a new in-flash processing (IFP) architecture. We demonstrate the benefits of CIPHERMATCH using two case studies: (1) Exact DNA string matching and (2) encrypted database search. Our pure software-based CIPHERMATCH implementation that uses our memory-efficient data packing scheme improves performance and reduces energy consumption by 42.9X and 17.6X, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art software baseline. Integrating CIPHERMATCH with IFP improves performance and reduces energy consumption by 136.9X and 256.4X, respectively, compared to the software-based CIPHERMATCH implementation.</description>

      <title>JBFuzz: Jailbreaking LLMs Efficiently and Effectively Using Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language understanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various aspects of our everyday life. However, their widespread availability also comes with novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content, via an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM developers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming to understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming approaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues, we propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming technique for jailbreaking LLMs.
  JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting bugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight mutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the fuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that JBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical questions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz is extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60 seconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the state-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and serves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.</description>

      <title>Prompt Inversion Attack against Collaborative Inference of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied for their remarkable capability of content generation. However, the practical use of open-source LLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and limiting widespread development. The collaborative inference is a promising solution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset of layers and transmitting intermediate activation. Many companies are building collaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging users' underutilized GPUs. Despite widespread interest in collaborative inference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM collaborative inference have not been well studied. This is largely because of the challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong non-linearity.
  In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM collaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack (PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt through the activation transmitted by its previous participant. Extensive experiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing baselines. For example, our method achieves an 88.4\% token accuracy on the Skytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of transformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8\% accuracy. The results verify the effectiveness of our PIA attack and highlights its practical threat to LLM collaborative inference systems.</description>

      <title>Image Encryption Using DNA Encoding, Snake Permutation and Chaotic Substitution Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securing image data in IoT networks and other insecure information channels is a matter of critical concern. This paper presents a new image encryption scheme using DNA encoding, snake permutation and chaotic substitution techniques that ensures robust security of the image data with reduced computational overhead. The DNA encoding and snake permutation modules ensure effective scrambling of the pixels and result in efficient diffusion in the plaintext image. For the confusion part, the chaotic substitution technique is implemented, which substitutes the pixel values chosen randomly from 3 S-boxes. Extensive security analysis validate the efficacy of the image encryption algorithm proposed in this paper and results demonstrate that the encrypted images have an ideal information entropy of 7.9895 and an almost zero correlation coefficient of -0.001660. These results indicate a high degree of randomness and no correlation in the encrypted image.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) is extensively used in key biomedical areas, such as prosthetics, and assistive and interactive technologies. This paper presents a new hybrid neural network named ConSGruNet for precise and efficient hand gesture recognition. The proposed model comprises convolutional neural networks with smart skip connections in conjunction with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The proposed model is trained on the complete Ninapro DB1 dataset. The proposed model boasts an accuracy of 99.7\% in classifying 53 classes in just 25 milliseconds. In addition to being fast, the proposed model is lightweight with just 3,946 KB in size. Moreover, the proposed model has also been evaluated for the reliability parameters, i.e., Cohen's kappa coefficient, Matthew's correlation coefficient, and confidence intervals. The close to ideal results of these parameters validate the models performance on unseen data.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Threshold Signing Schemes in Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) protocols have gained significant attention over the past ten years due to their widespread adoption in cryptocurrencies. The adoption is mainly boosted by Gennaro and Goldfedder's TSS protocol. Since then, various TSS protocols have been introduced with different features, such as security and performance, etc. Large organizations are using TSS protocols to protect many digital assets, such as cryptocurrency. However, the adoption of these TSS protocols requires an understanding of state-of-the-art research in threshold signing. This study describes the holistic view of TSS protocols, evaluates cutting-edge TSS protocols, highlights their characteristics, and compares them in terms of security and performance. The evaluation of these TSS protocols will help the researchers address real-world problems by considering the relevant merits of different TSS protocols.</description>

      <title>C^2 ATTACK: Towards Representation Backdoor on CLIP via Concept Confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models, enabling adversaries to embed hidden triggers that manipulate the behavior of the model during inference. Traditional backdoor attacks typically rely on inserting explicit triggers (e.g., external patches, or perturbations) into input data, but they often struggle to evade existing defense mechanisms. To address this limitation, we investigate backdoor attacks through the lens of the reasoning process in deep learning systems, drawing insights from interpretable AI. We conceptualize backdoor activation as the manipulation of learned concepts within the model's latent representations. Thus, existing attacks can be seen as implicit manipulations of these activated concepts during inference. This raises interesting questions: why not manipulate the concepts explicitly? This idea leads to our novel backdoor attack framework, Concept Confusion Attack (C^2 ATTACK), which leverages internal concepts in the model's reasoning as "triggers" without introducing explicit external modifications. By avoiding the use of real triggers and directly activating or deactivating specific concepts in latent spaces, our approach enhances stealth, making detection by existing defenses significantly harder. Using CLIP as a case study, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of C^2 ATTACK, achieving high attack success rates while maintaining robustness against advanced defenses.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Unstructured Sparsity in Fully Homomorphic Encrypted DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) in privacy-sensitive environments is constrained by computational overheads in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). This paper explores unstructured sparsity in FHE matrix multiplication schemes as a means of reducing this burden while maintaining model accuracy requirements. We demonstrate that sparsity can be exploited in arbitrary matrix multiplication, providing runtime benefits compared to a baseline naive algorithm at all sparsity levels. This is a notable departure from the plaintext domain, where there is a trade-off between sparsity and the overhead of the sparse multiplication algorithm. In addition, we propose three sparse multiplication schemes in FHE based on common plaintext sparse encodings. We demonstrate the performance gain is scheme-invariant; however, some sparse schemes vastly reduce the memory storage requirements of the encrypted matrix at high sparsity values. Our proposed sparse schemes yield an average performance gain of 2.5x at 50% unstructured sparsity, with our multi-threading scheme providing a 32.5x performance increase over the equivalent single-threaded sparse computation when utilizing 64 cores.</description>

      <title>Prompt Inference Attack on Distributed Large Language Model Inference Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inference process of modern large language models (LLMs) demands prohibitive computational resources, rendering them infeasible for deployment on consumer-grade devices. To address this limitation, recent studies propose distributed LLM inference frameworks, which employ split learning principles to enable collaborative LLM inference on resource-constrained hardware. However, distributing LLM layers across participants requires the transmission of intermediate outputs, which may introduce privacy risks to the original input prompts - a critical issue that has yet to be thoroughly explored in the literature.
  In this paper, we rigorously examine the privacy vulnerabilities of distributed LLM inference frameworks by designing and evaluating three prompt inference attacks aimed at reconstructing input prompts from intermediate LLM outputs. These attacks are developed under various query and data constraints to reflect diverse real-world LLM service scenarios. Specifically, the first attack assumes an unlimited query budget and access to an auxiliary dataset sharing the same distribution as the target prompts. The second attack also leverages unlimited queries but uses an auxiliary dataset with a distribution differing from the target prompts. The third attack operates under the most restrictive scenario, with limited query budgets and no auxiliary dataset available. We evaluate these attacks on a range of LLMs, including state-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.2 and Phi-3.5, as well as widely-used models like GPT-2 and BERT for comparative analysis. Our experiments show that the first two attacks achieve reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90%, while the third achieves accuracies typically above 50%, even under stringent constraints. These findings highlight privacy risks in distributed LLM inference frameworks, issuing a strong alert on their deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Preventing Data Poisoning Attacks on AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the critical issue of data poisoning attacks on AI models, a growing concern in the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. As advanced technology systems become increasingly prevalent across various sectors, the need for robust defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks becomes paramount. The study aims to develop and evaluate novel techniques for detecting and preventing data poisoning attacks, focusing on both theoretical frameworks and practical applications. Through a comprehensive literature review, experimental validation using the CIFAR-10 and Insurance Claims datasets, and the development of innovative algorithms, this paper seeks to enhance the resilience of AI models against malicious data manipulation. The study explores various methods, including anomaly detection, robust optimization strategies, and ensemble learning, to identify and mitigate the effects of poisoned data during model training. Experimental results indicate that data poisoning significantly degrades model performance, reducing classification accuracy by up to 27% in image recognition tasks (CIFAR-10) and 22% in fraud detection models (Insurance Claims dataset). The proposed defence mechanisms, including statistical anomaly detection and adversarial training, successfully mitigated poisoning effects, improving model robustness and restoring accuracy levels by an average of 15-20%. The findings further demonstrate that ensemble learning techniques provide an additional layer of resilience, reducing false positives and false negatives caused by adversarial data injections.</description>

      <title>RaceTEE: A Practical Privacy-Preserving Off-Chain Smart Contract Execution Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized on-chain smart contracts enable trustless collaboration, yet their inherent data transparency and execution overhead hinder widespread adoption. Existing cryptographic approaches incur high computational costs and lack generality. Meanwhile, prior TEE-based solutions suffer from practical limitations, such as the inability to support inter-contract interactions, reliance on unbreakable TEEs, and compromised usability. We introduce RaceTEE, a practical and privacy-preserving off-chain execution architecture for smart contracts that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). RaceTEE decouples transaction ordering (on-chain) from execution (off-chain), with computations performed competitively in TEEs, ensuring confidentiality and minimizing overhead. It further enhances practicality through three key improvements: supporting secure inter-contract interactions, providing a key rotation scheme that enforces forward and backward secrecy even in the event of TEE breaches, and enabling full compatibility with existing blockchains without altering the user interaction model. To validate its feasibility, we prototype RaceTEE using Intel SGX and Ethereum, demonstrating its applicability across various use cases and evaluating its performance.</description>

      <title>Heuristic-Based Address Clustering in Cardano Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has recently gained widespread popularity as a practical method of storing immutable data while preserving the privacy of users by anonymizing their real identities. This anonymization approach, however, significantly complicates the analysis of blockchain data. To address this problem, heuristic-based clustering algorithms as an effective way of linking all addresses controlled by the same entity have been presented in the literature. In this paper, considering the particular features of the Extended Unspent Transaction Outputs accounting model introduced by the Cardano blockchain, two new clustering heuristics are proposed for clustering the Cardano payment addresses. Applying these heuristics and employing the UnionFind algorithm, we efficiently cluster all the addresses that have appeared on the Cardano blockchain from September 2017 to January 2023, where each cluster represents a distinct entity. The results show that each medium-sized entity in the Cardano network owns and controls 9.67 payment addresses on average. The results also confirm that a power law distribution is fitted to the distribution of entity sizes recognized using our proposed heuristics.</description>

      <title>CyberLLMInstruct: A New Dataset for Analysing Safety of Fine-Tuned LLMs Using Cyber Security Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of new malware. To address these challenges, we developed CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks such as malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage process. This involved sourcing data from multiple resources, filtering and structuring it into instruction-response pairs, and aligning it with real-world scenarios to enhance its applicability. Seven open-source LLMs were chosen to test the usefulness of CyberLLMInstruct: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark. These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains. All scripts required to reproduce the dataset, along with examples and relevant resources for replicating our results, will be made available upon the paper's acceptance.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks fueled by Few-Short Learning to detect privacy leakage tackling data integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have an intrinsic privacy issue as they memorize parts of their training data, creating a privacy leakage. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) exploit it to obtain confidential information about the data used for training, aiming to steal information. They can be repurposed as a measurement of data integrity by inferring whether it was used to train a machine learning model. While state-of-the-art attacks achieve a significant privacy leakage, their requirements are not feasible enough, hindering their role as practical tools to assess the magnitude of the privacy risk. Moreover, the most appropriate evaluation metric of MIA, the True Positive Rate at low False Positive Rate lacks interpretability. We claim that the incorporation of Few-Shot Learning techniques to the MIA field and a proper qualitative and quantitative privacy evaluation measure should deal with these issues. In this context, our proposal is twofold. We propose a Few-Shot learning based MIA, coined as the FeS-MIA model, which eases the evaluation of the privacy breach of a deep learning model by significantly reducing the number of resources required for the purpose. Furthermore, we propose an interpretable quantitative and qualitative measure of privacy, referred to as Log-MIA measure. Jointly, these proposals provide new tools to assess the privacy leakage and to ease the evaluation of the training data integrity of deep learning models, that is, to analyze the privacy breach of a deep learning model. Experiments carried out with MIA over image classification and language modeling tasks and its comparison to the state-of-the-art show that our proposals excel at reporting the privacy leakage of a deep learning model with little extra information.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity Education: A Novel Curriculum for Enhancing Graduate STEM Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm with the potential to transform numerous application areas by addressing problems considered intractable in the classical domain. However, its integration into cyberspace introduces significant security and privacy challenges. The exponential rise in cyber attacks, further complicated by quantum capabilities, poses serious risks to financial systems and national security. The scope of quantum threats extends beyond traditional software, operating system, and network vulnerabilities, necessitating a shift in cybersecurity education. Traditional cybersecurity education, often reliant on didactic methods, lacks hands on, student centered learning experiences necessary to prepare students for these evolving challenges. There is an urgent need for curricula that address both classical and quantum security threats through experiential learning. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of EE 597: Introduction to Hardware Security, a graduate level course integrating hands-on quantum security learning with classical security concepts through simulations and cloud-based quantum hardware. Unlike conventional courses focused on quantum threats to cryptographic systems, EE 597 explores security challenges specific to quantum computing itself. We employ a mixed-methods evaluation using pre and post surveys to assess student learning outcomes and engagement. Results indicate significant improvements in students' understanding of quantum and hardware security, with strong positive feedback on course structure and remote instruction (mean scores: 3.33 to 3.83 on a 4 point scale).</description>

      <title>CASTLE: Benchmarking Dataset for Static Code Analyzers and LLMs towards CWE Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying vulnerabilities in source code is crucial, especially in critical software components. Existing methods such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, formal verification, and recently Large Language Models are widely used to detect security flaws. This paper introduces CASTLE (CWE Automated Security Testing and Low-Level Evaluation), a benchmarking framework for evaluating the vulnerability detection capabilities of different methods. We assess 13 static analysis tools, 10 LLMs, and 2 formal verification tools using a hand-crafted dataset of 250 micro-benchmark programs covering 25 common CWEs. We propose the CASTLE Score, a novel evaluation metric to ensure fair comparison. Our results reveal key differences: ESBMC (a formal verification tool) minimizes false positives but struggles with vulnerabilities beyond model checking, such as weak cryptography or SQL injection. Static analyzers suffer from high false positives, increasing manual validation efforts for developers. LLMs perform exceptionally well in the CASTLE dataset when identifying vulnerabilities in small code snippets. However, their accuracy declines, and hallucinations increase as the code size grows. These results suggest that LLMs could play a pivotal role in future security solutions, particularly within code completion frameworks, where they can provide real-time guidance to prevent vulnerabilities. The dataset is accessible at https://github.com/CASTLE-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Automatic Association of Quality Requirements and Quantifiable Metrics for Cloud Security Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS) is one of the first cybersecurity schemes in Europe, defined by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). It aims to encourage cloud providers to strengthen their cybersecurity policies in order to receive an official seal of approval from European authorities. EUCS defines a set of security requirements that the cloud provider must meet, in whole or in part, in order to achieve the security certification. The requirements are written in natural language and cover every aspect of security in the cloud environment, from logging access to protecting the system with anti-malware tools to training staff. Operationally, each requirement is associated with one or more evaluable metrics. For example, a requirement to monitor access attempts to a service will have associated metrics that take into account the number of accesses, the number of access attempts, who is accessing, and what resources are being used. Partners in the European project Medina, which ended in October 2023, defined 163 metrics and manually mapped them to 70 EUCS requirements. Manual mapping is intuitively a long and costly process in terms of human resources. This paper proposes an approach based on Sentence Transformers to automatically associate requirements and metrics. In terms of correctness of associations, the proposed method achieves a Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain of 0.640, improving a previous experiment by 0.146 points.</description>

      <title>RESTRAIN: Reinforcement Learning-Based Secure Framework for Trigger-Action IoT Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) platforms with trigger-action capability allow event conditions to trigger actions in IoT devices autonomously by creating a chain of interactions. Adversaries exploit this chain of interactions to maliciously inject fake event conditions into IoT hubs, triggering unauthorized actions on target IoT devices to implement remote injection attacks. Existing defense mechanisms focus mainly on the verification of event transactions using physical event fingerprints to enforce the security policies to block unsafe event transactions. These approaches are designed to provide offline defense against injection attacks. The state-of-the-art online defense mechanisms offer real-time defense, but extensive reliability on the inference of attack impacts on the IoT network limits the generalization capability of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a platform-independent multi-agent online defense system, namely RESTRAIN, to counter remote injection attacks at runtime. RESTRAIN allows the defense agent to profile attack actions at runtime and leverages reinforcement learning to optimize a defense policy that complies with the security requirements of the IoT network. The experimental results show that the defense agent effectively takes real-time defense actions against complex and dynamic remote injection attacks and maximizes the security gain with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Seal Your Backdoor with Variational Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose VIBE, a model-agnostic framework that trains classifiers resilient to backdoor attacks. The key concept behind our approach is to treat malicious inputs and corrupted labels from the training dataset as observed random variables, while the actual clean labels are latent. VIBE then recovers the corresponding latent clean label posterior through variational inference. The resulting training procedure follows the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The E-step infers the clean pseudolabels by solving an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, while the M-step updates the classifier parameters via gradient descent. Being modular, VIBE can seamlessly integrate with recent advancements in self-supervised representation learning, which enhance its ability to resist backdoor attacks. We experimentally validate the method effectiveness against contemporary backdoor attacks on standard datasets, a large-scale setup with 1$k$ classes, and a dataset poisoned with multiple attacks. VIBE consistently outperforms previous defenses across all tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Repeated Token Phenomenon in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their impressive capabilities, often fail to accurately repeat a single word when prompted to, and instead output unrelated text. This unexplained failure mode represents a vulnerability, allowing even end-users to diverge models away from their intended behavior. We aim to explain the causes for this phenomenon and link it to the concept of ``attention sinks'', an emergent LLM behavior crucial for fluency, in which the initial token receives disproportionately high attention scores. Our investigation identifies the neural circuit responsible for attention sinks and shows how long repetitions disrupt this circuit. We extend this finding to other non-repeating sequences that exhibit similar circuit disruptions. To address this, we propose a targeted patch that effectively resolves the issue without negatively impacting the model's overall performance. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for an LLM vulnerability, demonstrating how interpretability can diagnose and address issues, and offering insights that pave the way for more secure and reliable models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models for Hardware Verification: A Novel SystemVerilog Assertion Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware verification is crucial in modern SoC design, consuming around 70% of development time. SystemVerilog assertions ensure correct functionality. However, existing industrial practices rely on manual efforts for assertion generation, which becomes increasingly untenable as hardware systems become complex. Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process. However, proprietary SOTA models like GPT-4o often generate inaccurate assertions and require expensive licenses, while smaller open-source LLMs need fine-tuning to manage HDL code complexities. To address these issues, we introduce **VERT**, an open-source dataset designed to enhance SystemVerilog assertion generation using LLMs. VERT enables researchers in academia and industry to fine-tune open-source models, outperforming larger proprietary ones in both accuracy and efficiency while ensuring data privacy through local fine-tuning and eliminating costly licenses. The dataset is curated by systematically augmenting variables from open-source HDL repositories to generate synthetic code snippets paired with corresponding assertions. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models like Deepseek Coder 6.7B and Llama 3.1 8B outperform GPT-4o, achieving up to 96.88% improvement over base models and 24.14% over GPT-4o on platforms including OpenTitan, CVA6, OpenPiton and Pulpissimo. VERT is available at https://github.com/AnandMenon12/VERT.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models-Aided Program Debloating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As software grows in complexity to accommodate diverse features and platforms, software bloating has emerged as a significant challenge, adversely affecting performance and security. However, existing approaches inadequately address the dual objectives of debloating: maintaining functionality by preserving essential features and enhancing security by reducing security issues. Specifically, current software debloating techniques often rely on input-based analysis, using user inputs as proxies for the specifications of desired features. However, these approaches frequently overfit provided inputs, leading to functionality loss and potential security vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose LEADER, a program debloating framework enhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs), which leverages their semantic understanding, generative capabilities, and decision-making strengths. LEADER mainly consists of two modules: (1) a documentation-guided test augmentation module designed to preserve functionality, which leverages LLMs to comprehend program documentation and generates sufficient tests to cover the desired features comprehensively, and (2) a multi-advisor-aided program debloating module that employs a neuro-symbolic pipeline to ensure that the security of the software can be perceived during debloating. This module combines debloating and security advisors for analysis and employs an LLM as a decision-maker to eliminate undesired code securely. Extensive evaluations on widely used benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of LEADER. These results demonstrate that LEADER surpasses the state-of-the-art tool CovA in functionality and security. These results underscore the potential of LEADER to set a new standard in program debloating by effectively balancing functionality and security.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Analysis of Deeply Quantized Tiny Neural Networks Robust to Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the memory footprint of Machine Learning (ML) models, especially Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is imperative to facilitate their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. However, a notable drawback of DNN models lies in their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, wherein minor input perturbations can deceive them. A primary challenge revolves around the development of accurate, resilient, and compact DNN models suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents the outcomes of a compact DNN model that exhibits resilience against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks. This work has achieved this resilience through training with the QKeras quantization-aware training framework. The study explores the potential of QKeras and an adversarial robustness technique, Jacobian Regularization (JR), to co-optimize the DNN architecture through per-layer JR methodology. As a result, this paper has devised a DNN model employing this co-optimization strategy based on Stochastic Ternary Quantization (STQ). Its performance was compared against existing DNN models in the face of various white-box and black-box attacks. The experimental findings revealed that, the proposed DNN model had small footprint and on average, it exhibited better performance than Quanos and DS-CNN MLCommons/TinyML (MLC/T) benchmarks when challenged with white-box and black-box attacks, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 image and Google Speech Commands audio datasets.</description>

      <title>Not All Edges are Equally Robust: Evaluating the Robustness of Ranking-Based Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Ranking Learning (FRL) is a state-of-the-art FL framework that stands out for its communication efficiency and resilience to poisoning attacks. It diverges from the traditional FL framework in two ways: 1) it leverages discrete rankings instead of gradient updates, significantly reducing communication costs and limiting the potential space for malicious updates, and 2) it uses majority voting on the server side to establish the global ranking, ensuring that individual updates have minimal influence since each client contributes only a single vote. These features enhance the system's scalability and position FRL as a promising paradigm for FL training.
  However, our analysis reveals that FRL is not inherently robust, as certain edges are particularly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Through a theoretical investigation, we prove the existence of these vulnerable edges and establish a lower bound and an upper bound for identifying them in each layer. Based on this finding, we introduce a novel local model poisoning attack against FRL, namely the Vulnerable Edge Manipulation (VEM) attack. The VEM attack focuses on identifying and perturbing the most vulnerable edges in each layer and leveraging an optimization-based approach to maximize the attack's impact. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our attack achieves an overall 53.23% attack impact and is 3.7x more impactful than existing methods. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in ranking-based FL systems and underline the urgency for the development of new robust FL frameworks.</description>

      <title>KNighter: Transforming Static Analysis with LLM-Synthesized Checkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems like operating system kernels. However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large codebases remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations.
  We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks practical LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive codebases, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 70 new bugs/vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel, with 56 confirmed and 41 already fixed. 11 of these findings have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Backdoor Attacks with Reasonable Constraints on Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks against GNNs use fixed-pattern triggers and lack reasonable trigger constraints, overlooking individual graph characteristics and rendering insufficient evasiveness. To tackle the above issues, we propose ABARC, the first Adaptive Backdoor Attack with Reasonable Constraints, applying to both graph-level and node-level tasks in GNNs. For graph-level tasks, we propose a subgraph backdoor attack independent of the graph's topology. It dynamically selects trigger nodes for each target graph and modifies node features with constraints based on graph similarity, feature range, and feature type. For node-level tasks, our attack begins with an analysis of node features, followed by selecting and modifying trigger features, which are then constrained by node similarity, feature range, and feature type. Furthermore, an adaptive edge-pruning mechanism is designed to reduce the impact of neighbors on target nodes, ensuring a high attack success rate (ASR). Experimental results show that even with reasonable constraints for attack evasiveness, our attack achieves a high ASR while incurring a marginal clean accuracy drop (CAD). When combined with the state-of-the-art defense randomized smoothing (RS) method, our attack maintains an ASR over 94%, surpassing existing attacks by more than 7%.</description>

      <title>Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.</description>

      <title>Probing Network Decisions: Capturing Uncertainties and Unveiling Vulnerabilities Without Label Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve trust and transparency, it is crucial to be able to interpret the decisions of Deep Neural classifiers (DNNs). Instance-level examinations, such as attribution techniques, are commonly employed to interpret the model decisions. However, when interpreting misclassified decisions, human intervention may be required. Analyzing the attribu tions across each class within one instance can be particularly labor intensive and influenced by the bias of the human interpreter. In this paper, we present a novel framework to uncover the weakness of the classifier via counterfactual examples. A prober is introduced to learn the correctness of the classifier's decision in terms of binary code-hit or miss. It enables the creation of the counterfactual example concerning the prober's decision. We test the performance of our prober's misclassification detection and verify its effectiveness on the image classification benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by generating counterfactuals that penetrate the prober, we demonstrate that our framework effectively identifies vulnerabilities in the target classifier without relying on label information on the MNIST dataset.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Two-Qubit Grover Algorithm in MBQC with Universal Blind Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of quantum computing technology has led to the emergence of early-stage quantum cloud computing services. To fully realize the potential of quantum cloud computing, it is essential to develop techniques that ensure the privacy of both data and functions. Quantum computations often leverage superposition to evaluate a function on all possible inputs simultaneously, making function privacy a critical requirement. In 2009, Broadbent et al. introduced the Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) protocol, which is based on Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) and provides a framework for ensuring both function and data privacy in quantum computing. Although theoretical results indicate an equivalence between MBQC and circuitbased quantum computation, translating MBQC into circuitbased implementations remains challenging due to higher qubit requirements and the complexity of the transformation process. Consequently, current quantum cloud computing platforms are limited in their ability to simulate MBQC efficiently. This paper presents an efficient method to simulate MBQC on circuit-based quantum computing platforms. We validate this approach by implementing the two-qubit Grover algorithm in the MBQC framework and further demonstrate blindness by applying the UBQC protocol. This work verifies the simulation of a blind quantum computation using the two-qubit Grover algorithm on a circuit-based quantum computing platform.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Personalized Federated Learning Based on Dynamically Sparsified Client Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized federated learning is extensively utilized in scenarios characterized by data heterogeneity, facilitating more efficient and automated local training on data-owning terminals. This includes the automated selection of high-performance model parameters for upload, thereby enhancing the overall training process. However, it entails significant risks of privacy leakage. Existing studies have attempted to mitigate these risks by utilizing differential privacy. Nevertheless, these studies present two major limitations: (1) The integration of differential privacy into personalized federated learning lacks sufficient personalization, leading to the introduction of excessive noise into the model. (2) It fails to adequately control the spatial scope of model update information, resulting in a suboptimal balance between data privacy and model effectiveness in differential privacy federated learning. In this paper, we propose a differentially private personalized federated learning approach that employs dynamically sparsified client updates through reparameterization and adaptive norm(DP-pFedDSU). Reparameterization training effectively selects personalized client update information, thereby reducing the quantity of updates. This approach minimizes the introduction of noise to the greatest extent possible. Additionally, dynamic adaptive norm refers to controlling the norm space of model updates during the training process, mitigating the negative impact of clipping on the update information. These strategies substantially enhance the effective integration of differential privacy and personalized federated learning. Experimental results on EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves superior performance and is well-suited for more complex personalized federated learning scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We propose a protocol based on mechanism design theory and encrypted control to solve average consensus problems among rational and strategic agents while preserving their privacy. The proposed protocol provides a mechanism that incentivizes the agents to faithfully implement the intended behavior specified in the protocol. Furthermore, the protocol runs over encrypted data using homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to protect the privacy of agents. We also analyze the security of the proposed protocol using a simulation paradigm in secure multi-party computation. The proposed protocol demonstrates that mechanism design and encrypted control can complement each other to achieve security under rational adversaries.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Membership Inference Vulnerability in Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training without the need to share clients' personal data, thereby preserving privacy. However, the non-IID nature of the clients' data introduces major challenges for FL, highlighting the importance of personalized federated learning (PFL) methods. In PFL, models are trained to cater to specific feature distributions present in the population data. A notable method for PFL is the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), which mitigates the concerns associated with the non-IID-ness by grouping clients with similar data distributions. While it has been shown that IFCA enhances both accuracy and fairness, its strategy of dividing the population into smaller clusters increases vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), particularly among minorities with limited training samples. In this paper, we introduce IFCA-MIR, an improved version of IFCA that integrates MIA risk assessment into the clustering process. Allowing clients to select clusters based on both model performance and MIA vulnerability, IFCA-MIR achieves an improved performance with respect to accuracy, fairness, and privacy. We demonstrate that IFCA-MIR significantly reduces MIA risk while maintaining comparable model accuracy and fairness as the original IFCA.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoder as a Zero-Shot Classifier for Concept Erasing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at: https://github.com/NANSirun/Interpret-then-deactivate.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Equilibrium Finding in Polymatrix Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equilibrium finding in polymatrix games under differential privacy constraints. To start, we show that high accuracy and asymptotically vanishing differential privacy budget (as the number of players goes to infinity) cannot be achieved simultaneously under either of the two settings: (i) We seek to establish equilibrium approximation guarantees in terms of Euclidean distance to the equilibrium set, and (ii) the adversary has access to all communication channels. Then, assuming the adversary has access to a constant number of communication channels, we develop a novel distributed algorithm that recovers strategies with simultaneously vanishing Nash gap (in expected utility, also referred to as exploitability and privacy budget as the number of players increases.</description>

      <title>Auspex: Building Threat Modeling Tradecraft into an Artificial Intelligence-based Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Auspex - a threat modeling system built using a specialized collection of generative artificial intelligence-based methods that capture threat modeling tradecraft. This new approach, called tradecraft prompting, centers on encoding the on-the-ground knowledge of threat modelers within the prompts that drive a generative AI-based threat modeling system. Auspex employs tradecraft prompts in two processing stages. The first stage centers on ingesting and processing system architecture information using prompts that encode threat modeling tradecraft knowledge pertaining to system decomposition and description. The second stage centers on chaining the resulting system analysis through a collection of prompts that encode tradecraft knowledge on threat identification, classification, and mitigation. The two-stage process yields a threat matrix for a system that specifies threat scenarios, threat types, information security categorizations and potential mitigations. Auspex produces formalized threat model output in minutes, relative to the weeks or months a manual process takes. More broadly, the focus on bespoke tradecraft prompting, as opposed to fine-tuning or agent-based add-ons, makes Auspex a lightweight, flexible, modular, and extensible foundational system capable of addressing the complexity, resource, and standardization limitations of both existing manual and automated threat modeling processes. In this connection, we establish the baseline value of Auspex to threat modelers through an evaluation procedure based on feedback collected from cybersecurity subject matter experts measuring the quality and utility of threat models generated by Auspex on real banking systems. We conclude with a discussion of system performance and plans for enhancements to Auspex.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Attack on the Cloned: In-Band Active Man-in-the-Middle Detection for the Signal Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With Signal's position as one of the most popular secure messaging protocols in use today, the threat of government coercion and mass surveillance, i.e., active Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, are more relevant than ever. On the other hand, studies [29, 33, 37, 38] have shown that user awareness is very poor when it comes to authenticating keys in instant messaging applications, e.g., comparing key fingerprints out-of-band. The ideal solution to this problem should not require the active participation of the users. Our solution to active MitM attacks builds directly on Signal. We automate the process of key confirmation without relying on the intervention of users, and without using an out-of-band communication channel, at the cost of slightly altered trust assumptions on the server. We consider a powerful active MitM that not only controls the communication channel, but also has (one time) access to all secrets on one of the clients, i.e., can perform a key compromise attack. Our solution utilises the server to keep track of the changes in the clients key fingerprint as ratcheting is performed. Given that the server can keep a message log already, we find that any impact on deniability is minimal in practice. We present our detailed modifications to Signal, and document the new security guarantees while preserving the existing security guarantees of Signal. Our proof-of-concept implementation, which is based on the open-source Signal library used in real-world instant messaging applications, shows that our solution is practical and integrates well with the library. Our experimental results further show that our solution only has a tiny performance overhead when compared to Signal.</description>

      <title>CryptoX : Compositional Reasoning Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The compositional reasoning capacity has long been regarded as critical to the generalization and intelligence emergence of large language models LLMs. However, despite numerous reasoning-related benchmarks, the compositional reasoning capacity of LLMs is rarely studied or quantified in the existing benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce CryptoX, an evaluation framework that, for the first time, combines existing benchmarks and cryptographic, to quantify the compositional reasoning capacity of LLMs. Building upon CryptoX, we construct CryptoBench, which integrates these principles into several benchmarks for systematic evaluation. We conduct detailed experiments on widely used open-source and closed-source LLMs using CryptoBench, revealing a huge gap between open-source and closed-source LLMs. We further conduct thorough mechanical interpretability experiments to reveal the inner mechanism of LLMs' compositional reasoning, involving subproblem decomposition, subproblem inference, and summarizing subproblem conclusions. Through analysis based on CryptoBench, we highlight the value of independently studying compositional reasoning and emphasize the need to enhance the compositional reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>SSD: A State-based Stealthy Backdoor Attack For Navigation System in UAV Route Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed to perform high-risk tasks that require minimal human intervention. However, UAVs face escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly from GNSS spoofing attacks. While previous studies have extensively investigated the impacts of GNSS spoofing on UAVs, few have focused on its effects on specific tasks. Moreover, the influence of UAV motion states on the assessment of network security risks is often overlooked. To address these gaps, we first provide a detailed evaluation of how motion states affect the effectiveness of network attacks. We demonstrate that nonlinear motion states not only enhance the effectiveness of position spoofing in GNSS spoofing attacks but also reduce the probability of speed-related attack detection. Building upon this, we propose a state-triggered backdoor attack method (SSD) to deceive GNSS systems and assess its risk to trajectory planning tasks. Extensive validation of SSD's effectiveness and stealthiness is conducted. Experimental results show that, with appropriately tuned hyperparameters, SSD significantly increases positioning errors and the risk of task failure, while maintaining 100% stealth across three state-of-the-art detectors.</description>

      <title>Secret-Key Agreement Using Physical Identifiers for Degraded and Less Noisy Authentication Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10478v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secret-key agreement based on biometric or physical identifiers is a promising security protocol for authenticating users or devices with small chips due to its lightweight security. In previous studies, the fundamental limits of such a protocol were analyzed, and the results showed that two auxiliary random variables were involved in the capacity region expressions. However, with these two auxiliary random variables, the complexity of computing the capacity regions may be prohibitively high. To deal with this problem, we explore classes of authentication channels that require only one auxiliary random variable in the expressions of the capacity regions. It is revealed that for the classes of degraded and less noisy authentication channels, a single auxiliary random variable is sufficient to express the capacity regions. As specific examples, we derive the closed-form expressions for binary and Gaussian sources. Also, numerical calculations for Gaussian sources are provided to show the trade-off between secret-key and privacy-leakage rates under a given storage rate, and to illustrate how the noise in the enrollment phase affects the capacity region.</description>

      <title>Robustness Inspired Graph Backdoor Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising results in tasks such as node classification and graph classification. However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing a significant threat to their real-world adoption. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, there is no work on defending against various types of backdoor attacks where generated triggers have different properties. Hence, we first empirically verify that prediction variance under edge dropping is a crucial indicator for identifying poisoned nodes. With this observation, we propose using random edge dropping to detect backdoors and theoretically show that it can efficiently distinguish poisoned nodes from clean ones. Furthermore, we introduce a novel robust training strategy to efficiently counteract the impact of the triggers. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our framework can effectively identify poisoned nodes, significantly degrade the attack success rate, and maintain clean accuracy when defending against various types of graph backdoor attacks with different properties.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy AIGC Copyright Management with Full Lifecycle Recording and Multi-party Supervision in Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence technology becomes increasingly widespread, AI-generated content (AIGC) is gradually penetrating into many fields. Although AIGC plays an increasingly prominent role in business and cultural communication, the issue of copyright has also triggered widespread social discussion. The current legal system for copyright is built around human creators, yet in the realm of AIGC, the role of humans in content creation has diminished, with the creative expression primarily reliant on artificial intelligence. This discrepancy has led to numerous complexities and challenges in determining the copyright ownership of AIGC within the established legal boundaries. In view of this, it is necessary to meticulously record contributions of all entities involved in the generation of AIGC to achieve a fair distribution of copyright. For this purpose, this study thoroughly records the intermediate data generated throughout the full lifecycle of AIGC and deposits them into a decentralized blockchain system for secure multi-party supervision, thereby constructing a trustworthy AIGC copyright management system. In the event of copyright disputes, auditors can retrieve valuable proof from the blockchain, accurately defining the copyright ownership of AIGC products. Both theoretical and experimental analyses confirm that this scheme shows exceptional performance and security in the management of AIGC copyrights.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Secured Information Systems in Smart Cities: Collaborative IoT Computing with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised critical challenges associated with privacy, security, and data integrity, specifically in infrastructures such as smart cities or smart manufacturing. Blockchain technology provides immutable, scalable, and decentralized solutions to address these challenges, and integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into the IoT environment offers enhanced adaptability and decision-making. This paper investigates the integration of blockchain and DRL to optimize mobile transmission and secure data exchange in IoT-assisted smart cities. Through the clustering and categorization of IoT application systems, the combination of DRL and blockchain is shown to enhance the performance of IoT networks by maintaining privacy and security. Based on the review of papers published between 2015 and 2024, we have classified the presented approaches and offered practical taxonomies, which provide researchers with critical perspectives and highlight potential areas for future exploration and research. Our investigation shows how combining blockchain's decentralized framework with DRL can address privacy and security issues, improve mobile transmission efficiency, and guarantee robust, privacy-preserving IoT systems. Additionally, we explore blockchain integration for DRL and outline the notable applications of DRL technology. By addressing the challenges of machine learning and blockchain integration, this study proposes novel perspectives for researchers and serves as a foundational exploration from an interdisciplinary standpoint.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Privacy-Preserving Improved Stochastic Masking for Federated Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in federated learning (FL), the integration of generative models into FL has been limited due to challenges such as high communication costs and unstable training in heterogeneous data environments. To address these issues, we propose PRISM, a FL framework tailored for generative models that ensures (i) stable performance in heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) resource efficiency in terms of communication cost and final model size. The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic binary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights, identifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a ``strong lottery ticket''. By communicating binary masks in a stochastic manner, PRISM minimizes communication overhead. This approach, combined with the utilization of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss and a mask-aware dynamic moving average aggregation method (MADA) on the server side, facilitates stable and strong generative capabilities by mitigating local divergence in FL scenarios. Moreover, thanks to its sparsifying characteristic, PRISM yields a lightweight model without extra pruning or quantization, making it ideal for environments such as edge devices. Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR10 demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing methods, while maintaining privacy with minimal communication costs. PRISM is the first to successfully generate images under challenging non-IID and privacy-preserving FL environments on complex datasets, where previous methods have struggled.</description>
