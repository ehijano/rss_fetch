      <title>On a linear DG approximation of chemotaxis models with damping gradient nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a novel linear and positivity preserving upwind discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approximation of a class of chemotaxis models with damping gradient nonlinearities. In particular, both a local and a nonlocal model including nonlinear diffusion, chemoattraction, chemorepulsion and logistic growth are considered. Some numerical experiments in the context of chemotactic collapse are presented, whose results are in accordance with the previous analysis of the approximation and show how the blow-up can be prevented by means of the damping gradient term.</description>

      <title>STM Image Analysis using Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) for analyzing and reconstructing Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) images of various crystalline lattice structures. We developed two distinct CAE architectures to process simulated STM images of simple cubic, body-centered cubic (BCC), face-centered cubic (FCC), and hexagonal lattices. Our models were trained on $17\times17$ pixel patches extracted from $256\times256$ simulated STM images, incorporating realistic noise characteristics. We evaluated the models' performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) index, and analyzed the learned latent space representations. The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning techniques in STM image analysis, while also highlighting challenges in latent space interpretability and full image reconstruction. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in automated analysis of atomic-scale imaging data, with potential applications in materials science and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Higher-order multiscale method and its convergence analysis for nonlinear thermo-electric coupling problems of composite structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a higher-order multiscale computational method for nonlinear thermo-electric coupling problems of composite structures, which possess temperature-dependent material properties and nonlinear Joule heating. The innovative contributions of this work are the novel multiscale formulation with the higher-order correction terms for periodic composite structures and the global error estimation with an explicit rate for higher-order multiscale solutions. By employing the multiscale asymptotic approach and the Taylor series technique, the higher-order multiscale method is established for time-dependent nonlinear thermo-electric coupling problems, which can keep the local balance of heat flux and electric charge for high-accuracy multiscale simulation. Furthermore, an efficient numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is presented in detail, and corresponding convergent analysis is also obtained. Two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments are conducted to showcase the competitive advantages of the proposed method for simulating the time-dependent nonlinear thermo-electric coupling problems in composite structures, not only exceptional numerical accuracy, but also less computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use inverted finite elements method for approximating solutions of second order elliptic equations with non-constant coefficients varying to infinity in the exterior of a 2D bounded obstacle, when a Neumann boundary condition is considered. After proposing an appropriate functional framework for the deployment of the method, we analyse its convergence and detail its implementation. Numerical tests performed after implementation confirm convergence and high efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Structural schemes for hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an adaptation of the so-called structural method \cite{CMM23} for Hamiltonian systems, and redesign the method for this specific context, which involves two coupled differential systems. Structural schemes decompose the problem into two sets of equations: the physical equations, which describe the local dynamics of the system, and the structural equations, which only involve the discretization on a very compact stencil. They have desirable properties, such as unconditional stability or high-order accuracy. We first give a general description of the scheme for the scalar case (which corresponds to e.g. spring-mass interactions or pendulum motion), before extending the technique to the vector case (treating e.g. the $n$-body system). The scheme is also written in the case of a non-separable system (e.g. a charged particle in an electromagnetic field). We give numerical evidence of the method's efficiency, its capacity to preserve invariant quantities such as the total energy, and draw comparisons with the traditional symplectic methods.</description>

      <title>Reduced digital nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent papers ``The fast reduced QMC matrix-vector product'' (J. Comput. Appl. Math. 440, 115642, 2024) and ``Column reduced digital nets'' (submitted), it was proposed to use QMC rules based on reduced digital nets which provide a speed-up in the computation of QMC vector-matrix products that may occur in practical applications. In this paper, we provide upper bounds on the quality parameter of row reduced and column-row reduced digital nets, which are helpful for the error analysis of using reduced point sets as integration nodes in a QMC rule. We also give remarks on further aspects and comparisons of row reduced, column reduced, and column-row reduced digital net.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional multiscale discrete Radon and John transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two algorithms are introduced for the computation of discrete integral transforms with a multiscale approach operating in discrete three-dimensional (3D) volumes while considering its real-time implementation.
  The first algorithm, referred to as 3D discrete Radon transform (DRT) of planes, will compute the summation set of values lying in discrete planes in a cube that imitates, in discrete data, the integrals on two-dimensional planes in a 3D volume similar to the continuous Radon transform. The normals of these planes, equispaced in ascents, cover a quadrilateralized hemisphere and comprise 12 dodecants.
  The second proposed algorithm, referred to as the 3D discrete John transform (DJT) of lines, will sum elements lying on discrete 3D lines while imitating the behavior of the John or X-ray continuous transform on 3D volumes.
  These discrete integral transforms do not perform interpolation on input or intermediate data, and they can be computed using only integer arithmetics with linearithmic complexity; thus, outperforming the methods based on the Fourier slice-projection theorem for real-time applications.
  We briefly prove that these transforms have fast inversion algorithms that are exact for discrete inputs.</description>

      <title>Numerical solutions of random mean square Fisher-KPP models with advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the construction of numerical stable solutions of random mean square Fisher-KPP models with advection. The construction of the numerical scheme is performed in two stages. Firstly, a semidiscretization technique transforms the original continuous problem into a nonlinear unhomogeneous system of random differential equations. Then, by extending to the random framework the ideas of the exponential time differencing method, a full vector discretization of the problem addresses to a random vector difference scheme. A sample approach of the random vector difference scheme, the use of properties of Metzler matrices and the logarithmic norm allow the proof of stability of the numerical solutions in the mean square sense. In spite of the computational complexity the results are illustrated by comparing the results with a test problem where the exact solution is known.</description>

      <title>A hybrid Reduced Order Model to enforce outflow pressure boundary conditions in computational haemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the development of a Reduced-Order Model (ROM) to investigate haemodynamics in cardiovascular applications. It employs the use of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the computation of the basis functions and the Galerkin projection for the computation of the reduced coefficients. The main novelty of this work lies in the extension of the lifting function method, which typically is adopted for treating nonhomogeneous inlet velocity boundary conditions, to the handling of nonhomogeneous outlet boundary conditions for the pressure, representing a very delicate point in the numerical simulations of the cardiovascular system. Moreover, we incorporate a properly trained neural network in the ROM framework to approximate the mapping from the time parameter to the outflow pressure, which in the most general case is not available in closed form. We define our approach as "hybrid", because it merges physics-based elements with data-driven ones. At full order level, a Finite Volume method is employed for the discretization of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations while a two-element Windkessel model is adopted to enforce a valuable estimation of the outflow pressure. Numerical results, firstly related to a 2D idealized blood vessel and then to a 3D patient-specific aortic arch, demonstrate that our ROM is able to accurately approximate the FOM with a significant reduction in the computational cost.</description>

      <title>A decoupled linear, mass-conservative block-centered finite difference method for the Keller-Segel chemotaxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a class of nonlinear partial differential equations, the Keller-Segel system is widely used to model chemotaxis in biology. In this paper, we present the construction and analysis of a decoupled linear, mass-conservative, block-centered finite difference method for the classical Keller-Segel chemotaxis system. We show that the scheme is mass conservative for the cell density at the discrete level. In addition, second-order temporal and spatial convergence for both the cell density and the chemoattractant concentration are rigorously discussed, using the mathematical induction method, the discrete energy method and detailed analysis of the truncation errors. Our scheme is proposed and analyzed on non-uniform spatial grids, which leads to more accurate and efficient modeling results for the chemotaxis system with rapid blow-up phenomenon. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Keller-Segel chemotaxis system are also discussed. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical results and to show the robustness and accuracy of the scheme.</description>

      <title>An Auto-Stabilized Weak Galerkin Method for Elasticity Interface Problems on Nonconvex Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an auto-stabilized weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for elasticity interface problems on general polygonal and polyhedral meshes, without requiring convexity constraints. The method utilizes bubble functions as key analytical tools, eliminating the need for stabilizers typically used in traditional WG methods and leading to a more streamlined formulation. The proposed method is symmetric, positive definite, and easy to implement. Optimal-order error estimates are derived for the WG approximations in the discrete $H^1$-norm, assuming the exact solution has sufficient smoothness. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy and efficiency of the auto-stabilized WG method.</description>

      <title>Fast and Provable Tensor-Train Format Tensor Completion via Precondtioned Riemannian Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank tensor completion aims to recover a tensor from partially observed entries, and it is widely applicable in fields such as quantum computing and image processing. Due to the significant advantages of the tensor train (TT) format in handling structured high-order tensors, this paper investigates the low-rank tensor completion problem based on the TT-format. We proposed a preconditioned Riemannian gradient descent algorithm (PRGD) to solve low TT-rank tensor completion and establish its linear convergence. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the PRGD algorithm. On the simulated dataset, the PRGD algorithm reduced the computation time by two orders of magnitude compared to existing classical algorithms. In practical applications such as hyperspectral image completion and quantum state tomography, the PRGD algorithm significantly reduced the number of iterations, thereby substantially reducing the computational time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish a first general error estimate for numerical approximations of the system of reaction-diffusion equations (SRDEs), using reasonable regularity assumptions on the exact solutions. We employ the gradient discretisation method (GDM) to discretise the system and prove the existence and uniqueness of the approximate solutions. The analysis provided here is not limited to specific reaction functions, and it is applicable to all conforming and non-conforming schemes fitting within the GDM framework. As an application, we present numerical results based on a finite volume method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical note presents a counterexample showing that the equivalence conditions proposed by Geng et al. (IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 2024), which use a minimum-order compensator (MOC) to achieve desired designs, including generalized regularity or both generalized regularity and free of impulse, are sufficient but not necessary. Furthermore, revised equivalence conditions are introduced, along with an equivalence condition ensuring the closed-loop system remains generalized regular, impulse-free, and stable using MOC. Additionally, it is shown that output feedback can replace the MOC, achieving the same design without increasing dimensionality. These findings are validated through a circuit example.</description>

      <title>Modified approach for linear and non-linear IBVPs with fractional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical and numerical techniques have been developed for solving fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) and their systems with initial conditions. However, it is much more challenging to develop analytical or numerical techniques for FPDEs with boundary conditions, although some methods do exist to address such problems. In this paper, a modified technique based on the Adomian decomposition method with Laplace transformation is presented, which effectively treats initial-boundary value problems. The non-linear term has been controlled by Daftardar-Jafari polynomials. Our proposed technique is applied to several initial and boundary value problems and the obtained results are presented through graphs. The differing behavior of the solutions for the suggested problems is observed by using various fractional orders. It is found that our proposed technique has a high rate of convergence towards the exact solutions of the problems. Moreover, while implementing this modification, higher accuracy is achieved with a small number of calculations, which is the main novelty of the proposed technique. The present method requires a new approximate solution in each iteration that adds further accuracy to the solution. It demonstrates that our suggested technique can be used effectively to solve initial-boundary value problems of FPDEs.</description>

      <title>Solutions of differential equations in Freud-weighted Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay some mathematically rigorous foundations for the resolution of differential equations with respect to semi-classical bases and topologies, namely Freud-Sobolev polynomials and spaces. In this quest, we uncover an elegant theory melding various topics in Numerical and Functional Analysis: Poincar\'e inequalities, Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, Painlev\'e equations and more. Brought together, these ingredients allow us to quantify the compactness of Sobolev embeddings on Freud-weighted spaces and finally resolve some differential equations in this topology. As an application, we rigorously and tightly enclose solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with sextic potential.</description>

      <title>A real-time battle situation intelligent awareness system based on Meta-learning &amp; RNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern warfare, real-time and accurate battle situation analysis is crucial for making strategic and tactical decisions. The proposed real-time battle situation intelligent awareness system (BSIAS) aims at meta-learning analysis and stepwise RNN (recurrent neural network) modeling, where the former carries out the basic processing and analysis of battlefield data, which includes multi-steps such as data cleansing, data fusion, data mining and continuously updates, and the latter optimizes the battlefield modeling by stepwise capturing the temporal dependencies of data set. BSIAS can predict the possible movement from any side of the fence and attack routes by taking a simulated battle as an example, which can be an intelligent support platform for commanders to make scientific decisions during wartime. This work delivers the potential application of integrated BSIAS in the field of battlefield command &amp; analysis engineering.</description>

      <title>Effects of Transverse Force on Dusty Fluid Flow over a Linear Stretching Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a numerical investigation of the flow and heat transfer of a steady dusty flow over a linear horizontal stretching sheet. Transverse force effects have been taken into account. The flow problems formulation comprises of highly nonlinear PDEs that have been transformed into systems of ODEs by using similarity transformation. Then the ODEs has been solved numerically by using Shooting technique followed by Runge-Kutta 4th order method that is incorporated in BVP4C tool of the MATLAB software. The effects various flow parameters, such as the Prandtl number, Eckert number and transverse force on the flow geometry has been investigated. The overall findings are displayed in graphs and tables, and it is discovered that the transverse force reduces the velocity of the particle phase in the flow. Our results has been validated with existing literatures and found agrees with very good way.</description>

      <title>Models for information propagation on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07577v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and unify classes of different models for information propagation over graphs. In a first class, propagation is modelled as a wave which emanates from a set of \emph{known} nodes at an initial time, to all other \emph{unknown} nodes at later times with an ordering determined by the arrival time of the information wave front. A second class of models is based on the notion of a travel time along paths between nodes. The time of information propagation from an initial \emph{known} set of nodes to a node is defined as the minimum of a generalised travel time over subsets of all admissible paths. A final class is given by imposing a local equation of an eikonal form at each \emph{unknown} node, with boundary conditions at the \emph{known} nodes. The solution value of the local equation at a node is coupled to those of neighbouring nodes with lower values. We provide precise formulations of the model classes and prove equivalences between them. Finally we apply the front propagation models on graphs to semi-supervised learning via label propagation and information propagation on trust networks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive meshfree approximation for linear elliptic partial differential equations with PDE-greedy kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider meshless approximation for solutions of boundary value problems (BVPs) of elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) via symmetric kernel collocation. We discuss the importance of the choice of the collocation points, in particular by using greedy kernel methods. We introduce a scale of PDE-greedy selection criteria that generalizes existing techniques, such as the PDE-$P$-greedy and the PDE-$f$-greedy rules for collocation point selection. For these greedy selection criteria we provide bounds on the approximation error in terms of the number of greedily selected points and analyze the corresponding convergence rates. This is achieved by a novel analysis of Kolmogorov widths of special sets of BVP point-evaluation functionals. Especially, we prove that target-data dependent algorithms that make use of the right hand side functions of the BVP exhibit faster convergence rates than the target-data independent PDE-$P$-greedy. The convergence rate of the PDE-$f$-greedy possesses a dimension independent rate, which makes it amenable to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. The advantages of these greedy algorithms are highlighted by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shallow Ritz Method For 1D Diffusion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the shallow Ritz method for solving the one-dimensional diffusion problem. It is shown that the shallow Ritz method improves the order of approximation dramatically for non-smooth problems. To realize this optimal or nearly optimal order of the shallow Ritz approximation, we develop a damped block Newton (dBN) method that alternates between updates of the linear and non-linear parameters. Per each iteration, the linear and the non-linear parameters are updated by exact inversion and one step of a modified, damped Newton method applied to a reduced non-linear system, respectively. The computational cost of each dBN iteration is $O(n)$.
  Starting with the non-linear parameters as a uniform partition of the interval, numerical experiments show that the dBN is capable of efficiently moving mesh points to nearly optimal locations. To improve efficiency of the dBN further, we propose an adaptive damped block Newton (AdBN) method by combining the dBN with the adaptive neuron enhancement (ANE) method [26].</description>

      <title>Cons-training tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed \textit{constrained matrix product states} (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A unifying framework for ADI-like methods for linear matrix equations and beneficial consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the alternating-directions implicit (ADI) method based on a commuting operator split and apply the results in detail to the continuous time algebraic Lyapunov equation with low-rank constant term and approximate solution, giving pointers for the Sylvester case. Previously, it has been mandatory to start the low-rank ADI for Lyapunov equations (CF-ADI, LR-ADI, G-LR-ADI) or Sylvester equations (fADI, G-fADI) with an all-zero initial value. Our approach extends the known efficient iteration schemes of low-rank increments and residuals to arbitrary low-rank initial values for all these methods. We further generalize two properties of the low-rank Lyapunov ADI to the generic ADI applied to arbitrary linear equations using a commuting operator split, namely the invariance of iterates under permutations of the shift parameters, and the efficient handling of complex shift parameters.
  We investigate the performance of arbitrary initial values using two outer iterations in which the low-rank Lyapunov ADI is typically called. First, we solve an algebraic Riccati equation with the Newton method. Second, we solve a differential Riccati equation with a first-order Rosenbrock method. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed new initial value of the ADI can lead to a significant reduction in the total number of ADI steps, while also showing a 17% and 8x speed-up over the zero initial value for the two equation types, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a recent characterization of energy-preserving B-series, we derive the explicit conditions on the coefficients of a Runge-Kutta method that ensure energy preservation (for Hamiltonian systems) up to a given order in the step size, which we refer to as the pseudo-energy-preserving (PEP) order. We study explicit Runge-Kutta methods with PEP order higher than their classical order. We provide examples of such methods up to PEP order six, and test them on Hamiltonian ODE and PDE systems. We find that these methods behave similarly to exactly energy-conservative methods over moderate time intervals and exhibit significantly smaller errors, relative to other Runge-Kutta methods of the same order, for moderately long-time simulations.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of PDEs is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</description>

      <title>Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difficulty for solving ill-posed linear operator equations in Hilbert space is reflected by the strength of ill-posedness of the governing operator, and the inherent solution smoothness. In this study we focus on the ill-posedness of the operator, and we propose a partial ordering for the class of all bounded linear operators which lead to ill-posed operator equations. For compact linear operators, there is a simple characterization in terms of the decay rates of the singular values. In the context of the validity of the spectral theorem the partial ordering can also be understood. We highlight that range inclusions yield partial ordering, and we discuss cases when compositions of compact and non-compact operators occur. Several examples complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The randomized Kaczmarz (RK) method is a well-known approach for solving linear least-squares problems with a large number of rows. RK accesses and processes just one row at a time, leading to exponentially fast convergence for consistent linear systems. However, RK fails to converge to the least-squares solution for inconsistent systems. This work presents a simple fix: average the RK iterates produced in the tail part of the algorithm. The proposed tail-averaged randomized Kaczmarz (TARK) converges for both consistent and inconsistent least-squares problems at a polynomial rate, which is known to be optimal for any row-access method. An extension of TARK also leads to efficient solutions for ridge-regularized least-squares problems.</description>

      <title>Three-precision iterative refinement with parameter regularization and prediction for solving large sparse linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel mixed-precision iterative refinement algorithm, GADI-IR, within the general alternating-direction implicit (GADI) framework, designed for efficiently solving large-scale sparse linear systems. By employing low-precision arithmetic, particularly half-precision (FP16), for computationally intensive inner iterations, the method achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining high numerical accuracy. Key challenges such as overflow in FP16 and convergence issues for low precision are addressed through careful backward error analysis and the application of a regularization parameter $\alpha$. Furthermore, the integration of low-precision arithmetic into the parameter prediction process, using Gaussian process regression (GPR), significantly reduces computational time without degrading performance. The method is particularly effective for large-scale linear systems arising from discretized partial differential equations and other high-dimensional problems, where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the use of FP16 and mixed-precision strategies not only accelerates computation but also ensures robust convergence, making the approach advantageous for various applications. The results highlight the potential of leveraging lower-precision arithmetic to achieve superior computational efficiency in high-performance computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polytopic autoencoders provide low-di\-men\-sion\-al parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it improves on standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems. We discuss how the particular architecture enables exact representation of target states and higher order series expansions of the nonlinear feedback law at little extra computational effort in the online phase and how the linear though high-dimensional and nonstandard Lyapunov equations are efficiently computed during the offline phase. In a numerical study, we illustrate the procedure and how this approach can reliably outperform the standard linear-quadratic regulator design.</description>

      <title>A novel design update framework for topology optimization with quantum annealing: Application to truss and continuum structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design update strategy for topology optimization, as an iterative optimization. The key contribution lies in incorporating a design updater concept with quantum annealing, applicable to both truss and continuum structures. To align with density-based approaches in topology optimization, these updaters are formulated through a multiplicative relationship to represent the design material and serve as design variables. Specifically, structural analysis is conducted on a classical computer using the finite element method, while quantum annealing is utilized for topology updates. The primary objective of the framework is to minimize compliance under a volume constraint. An encoding formulation for the design variables is derived, and the penalty method along with a slack variable is employed to transform the inequality volume constraint. Subsequently, the optimization problem for determining the updater is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. To demonstrate its performance, the developed design framework is tested on different computing platforms to perform design optimization for truss structures, as well as 2D and 3D continuum structures. Numerical results indicate that the proposed framework successfully finds optimal topologies similar to benchmark results. Furthermore, the results show the advantage of reduced time in finding an optimal design using quantum annealing compared to simulated annealing.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution-based training of Free Knot Splines and ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of univariate nonlinear function approximation using shallow neural networks (NN) with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. We show that the $L_2$ based approximation problem is ill-conditioned and the behaviour of optimisation algorithms used in training these networks degrades rapidly as the width of the network increases. This can lead to significantly poorer approximation in practice than expected from the theoretical expressivity of the ReLU architecture and traditional methods such as univariate Free Knot Splines (FKS). Univariate shallow ReLU NNs and FKS span the same function space, and thus have the same theoretical expressivity. However, the FKS representation remains well-conditioned as the number of knots increases. We leverage the theory of optimal piecewise linear interpolants to improve the training procedure for ReLU NNs. Using the equidistribution principle, we propose a two-level procedure for training the FKS by first solving the nonlinear problem of finding the optimal knot locations of the interpolating FKS, and then determine the optimal weights and knots of the FKS by solving a nearly linear, well-conditioned problem. The training of the FKS gives insights into how we can train a ReLU NN effectively, with an equally accurate approximation. We combine the training of the ReLU NN with an equidistribution-based loss to find the breakpoints of the ReLU functions. This is then combined with preconditioning the ReLU NN approximation to find the scalings of the ReLU functions. This fast, well-conditioned and reliable method finds an accurate shallow ReLU NN approximation to a univariate target function. We test this method on a series of regular, singular, and rapidly varying target functions and obtain good results, realising the expressivity of the shallow ReLU network in all cases. We then extend our results to deeper networks.</description>

      <title>Mini-batch descent in semiflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of mini-batch gradient descent to semiflows (gradient flows). Given a loss function (potential), we introduce a continuous version of mini-batch gradient descent by randomly selecting sub-loss functions over time, defining a piecewise flow. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on the potential generating the semiflow, the \textit{mini-batch descent flow} trajectory closely approximates the original semiflow trajectory on average. In addition, we study a randomized minimizing movement scheme that also approximates the semiflow of the full loss function. We illustrate the versatility of this approach across various problems, including constrained optimization, sparse inversion, and domain decomposition. Finally, we validate our results with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>DeepONet for Solving Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations with Physics-Informed Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of operator learning, specifically DeepONet, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike conventional function learning methods that require training separate neural networks for each PDE, operator learning enables generalization across different PDEs without retraining. This study examines the performance of DeepONet in physics-informed training, focusing on two key aspects: (1) the approximation capabilities of deep branch and trunk networks, and (2) the generalization error in Sobolev norms. Our results demonstrate that deep branch networks provide substantial performance improvements, while trunk networks achieve optimal results when kept relatively simple. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the generalization error of DeepONet for solving nonlinear PDEs by analyzing the Rademacher complexity of its derivatives in terms of pseudo-dimension. This work bridges a critical theoretical gap by delivering rigorous error estimates. This paper fills a theoretical gap by providing error estimations for a wide range of physics-informed machine learning models and applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>Computing MHD equilibria of stellarators with a flexible coordinate frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the representation of axi-symmetric plasma configurations, it is natural to use cyl. coordinates (R,Z,$\phi$), where $\phi$ is an independent coordinate. The same cyl. coordinates have also been widely used for representing 3D MHD equilibria of non-axisymmetric configurations (stellarators), with cross-sections, defined in RZ-planes, that vary over $\phi$. Stellarator equilibria have been found, however, for which cyl. coordinates are not at all a natural choice, for instance certain stellarators obtained using the near-axis expansion (NAE), defined by a magn. axis curve and its Frenet frame.
  In this contribution, we propose an alternative approach for representing the boundary in a fixed-boundary 3D MHD equil. solver, moving away from cyl. coordinates. Instead, we use planar cross-sections whose orientation is determined by a general coordinate frame (G-Frame). This frame is similar to the conventional Frenet frame, but more flexible. As an additional part of the boundary representation, it becomes an input to the equil. solve, along with the geometry of the cross-sections. We see two advantages: 1) the capability to easily represent configurations where the magn. axis is highly non-planar or even knotted 2) a reduction in the degrees of freedom needed for the boundary surface, and thus the equil. solver, enabling progress in optimization of these configurations.
  We discuss the properties of the G-Frame, starting from the conventional Frenet frame. Then we show two exemplary ways of constructing it, first from a NAE solution and also from a given boundary surface. We present the details of the implementation of the new frame in the 3D MHD equil. solver GVEC. Furthermore, we demonstrate for a highly shaped QI-optimized stellarator that far fewer degrees of freedom are necessary to find a high quality equil. solution, compared to the solution computed in cyl. coordinates.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Zeroth-Order Stochastic Frank-Wolfe Framework for Constrained Finite-Sum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an enhanced zeroth-order stochastic Frank-Wolfe framework to address constrained finite-sum optimization problems, a structure prevalent in large-scale machine-learning applications. Our method introduces a novel double variance reduction framework that effectively reduces the gradient approximation variance induced by zeroth-order oracles and the stochastic sampling variance from finite-sum objectives. By leveraging this framework, our algorithm achieves significant improvements in query efficiency, making it particularly well-suited for high-dimensional optimization tasks. Specifically, for convex objectives, the algorithm achieves a query complexity of O(d \sqrt{n}/\epsilon ) to find an epsilon-suboptimal solution, where d is the dimensionality and n is the number of functions in the finite-sum objective. For non-convex objectives, it achieves a query complexity of O(d^{3/2}\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2 ) without requiring the computation ofd partial derivatives at each iteration. These complexities are the best known among zeroth-order stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithms that avoid explicit gradient calculations. Empirical experiments on convex and non-convex machine learning tasks, including sparse logistic regression, robust classification, and adversarial attacks on deep networks, validate the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both convergence rate and query complexity compared to existing methods.</description>
