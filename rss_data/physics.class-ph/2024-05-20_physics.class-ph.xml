      <title>Modes, Bounds, and Synthesis of Optimal Electromagnetic Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal synthesis of material distributions in obstacles for maximal extinction, scattering, or absorption. The material synthesis is based on an explicit construction utilizing the current distribution derived from physical bounds excited from the far-field. The bounds are expressed in radiation modes for materials restricted by their resistivity and characteristic modes for materials restricted by the contrast. The results are valid for arbitrary shapes, and analytical expressions are provided for spherical shapes.</description>

      <title>Fractional Particle and Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical fractional particle model in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, extending the Newtonian particle concept with the incorporation of the fractional Laplacian. A comprehensive discussion on kinetic properties, including linear momentum and kinetic energy, is provided. We further derive the equations of motion and discuss the symmetries of the system. The Green's function method is employed to solve the equations of motion in a general case. We illustrate the theory with three important examples: the free fractional particle, the fractional harmonic oscillator, and the charged fractional particle that interacts locally with the electromagnetic field. We use the results of the extension problem by Caffarelli and Silvestre, to construct the associated classical local sigma model for the fractional particle. The sigma model is then quantized using the canonical quantization method, and we compute the vacuum energy at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent optimization of acoustic holograms for transcranial focused ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic holographic lenses, also known as acoustic holograms, can change the phase of a transmitted wavefront in order to shape and construct complex ultrasound pressure fields, often for focusing the acoustic energy on a target region. These lenses have been proposed for transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) to create diffraction-limited focal zones that target specific brain regions while compensating for skull aberration. Holograms for tFUS are currently designed using time-reversal approaches in full-wave time-domain numerical simulations. However, such simulations need time-consuming computations, which severely limits the adoption of iterative optimization strategies. Furthermore, in the time-reversal method, the number and distribution of virtual sources can significantly influence the final sound field. Because of the computational constraints, predicting these effects and determining the optimal arrangement is challenging. This study introduces an efficient method for designing acoustic holograms using a volumetric holographic technique to generate focused fields inside the skull. The proposed method combines a modified mixed-domain method for ultrasonic propagation with a gradient descent iterative optimization algorithm. This approach enables substantially faster holographic computation than previously reported techniques. The iterative process uses explicitly defined loss functions to bias the ultrasound field's optimization parameters to specific desired characteristics, such as axial resolution, transversal resolution, coverage, and focal region uniformity, while eliminating the uncertainty associated with virtual sources in time-reversal techniques. Numerical studies are conducted on four brain structures: the anterior insula, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and amygdala. The findings are further validated in underwater experiments with a 3D-printed skull phantom.</description>
