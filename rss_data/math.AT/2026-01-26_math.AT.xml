      <title>Quasi-projective nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M=V\setminus D$ be a smooth quasi-projective variety for some smooth projective variety $V$ and a divisor $D$ with normal crossings. Assume that $M$ is diffeomorphic to a non-compact nilmanifold $\Gamma\backslash N\times\mathbb{R}^m$. We show that $M$ is diffeomorphic to a trivial bundle $T^n\times \mathbb{R}^m$ over a torus $T^n$ if the first cohomology $H^1(V)$ of $V$ vanishes. Moreover, in general, we show that $M$ is diffeomorphic to a trivial bundle $T^{b_1(M)}\times \mathbb{R}^m$ over a $b_1(M)$-dimensional torus $T^{b_1(M)}$, or a trivial bundle $E\times \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $E$ is a torus bundle $E\rightarrow T^{b_1(M)}$ over a torus $T^{b_1(M)}$. Conversely, we consider whether non-compact nilmanifolds are diffeomorphic to a smooth quasi-projective variety. We determine the Lie groups of dimension up to $8$ such that corresponding non-compact nilmanifolds may be diffeomorphic to smooth quasi-projective varieties.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff stability of barcodes over posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Isometry Theorem of Chazal et al. and Lesnick is a fundamental result in persistence theory, which states that the interleaving distance between two one-parameter persistence modules is equal to the bottleneck distance between their barcodes. Significant effort has been devoted to extending this result to modules defined over more general posets. As these modules do not generally admit nice decompositions, one must restrict attention to the class of interval-decomposable modules in order to define an appropriate notion of bottleneck distance. Even with this assumption, it is known that bottleneck distance may not be equivalent to interleaving distance, but that it is Lipschitz stable under certain, fairly restrictive, assumptions. In this paper, we consider the more basic question of stability of the Hausdorff distance with respect to interleaving distance for interval-decomposable modules. Our main theorem is a Lipschitz stability result, which holds in a fairly general setting of interval-decomposable modules over arbitrary posets, where intervals are assumed to be taken from any family satisfying certain closure conditions. Along the way, we develop some new tools and results for interval-decomposable modules over arbitrary posets, in the form of geometrically-flavored characterizations of the existence of morphisms and interleavings between interval modules.</description>

      <title>Duality for graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known and old result of Hazewinkel and Koszul states that the cohomology of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra is isomorphic, up to a suitable shift, to its twisted homology, a Lie-theoretical version of Poincare duality. This paper establishes an analogue of this result for graded (or super) Lie algebras and, more generally, differential graded Lie algebras.
  Closely related to this result is a calculation of the cohomology of a graded Lie algebra g with coefficients in its universal enveloping algebra U(g) as a one-sided module. This cohomology turns out to be one-dimensional and serves as a dualizing module for the cohomology of g. Moreover, it is shown that for a unimodular graded Lie algebra g, the derived category of U(g) has a Calabi-Yau structure. As a consequence, the category of rational infinity local systems on a simply connected topological space with totally finite-dimensional rational homotopy groups, has a Calabi-Yau structure, a generalization of Poincare duality for elliptic spaces.</description>

      <title>The Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection and Kontsevich-Soibelman operations on the periodic cyclic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant operations on the periodic cyclic homology of a dg algebra that arise from the chain level action of the two-colored Kontsevich-Soibelman operad. Using classical computations of Cohen [Coh], we explicitly compute a set of generators for these operations under composition, and show that they agree with the p-fold equivariant cap products previously studied by the author [Che2] in relation to equivariant Gromov-Witten theory with mod p coefficients. The main technical novelty is a re-formulation of the Kontsevich-Soibelman operad in terms of a two-colored version of the cacti operad, and a proof that it is equivariantly quasi-equivalent to the two-colored operad of little disks on a disk/cylinder. We give applications of the main results to symplectic topology, and more specifically, arithmetic aspects of Fukaya category and classical obstructions to realizing a middle cohomology class of a symplectic manifold by Lagrangian submanifold</description>

      <title>The real Brown-Peterson homology of $\Omega^\rho S^{\rho + 1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $RO(C_2)$-graded real Brown--Peterson homology of the representation-loop space $\Omega^\rho S^{\rho + 1}$, where $\rho$ is the regular representation of the cyclic group of order two. This calculation gives a $C_2$-equivariant analogue of the classical computation of Brown--Peterson homology of the double loop space $\Omega^2 S^3$ due to Ravenel. Along the way, we develop comodule Nishida relations for $\rho$-loop spaces.</description>

      <title>An extension of Steinberg's Theorem to biquotient pairs of subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the derived tensor product of the representation rings of subgroups of a given compact Lie group G. That is, given two such subgroups H_1 and H_2, we study the tensor product of the associated representation rings R(H_1) and R(H_2) over the representation ring RG, and prove a vanishing result for the associated higher Tor-groups. This result can be viewed as a natural generalization of the Theorem of Steinberg that asserts that the representation rings of maximal rank subgroups of G are free over RG. It my also be viewed as an analogue of a result of Singhof on the cohomology of classifying spaces. We include an immediate application to the complex K-theory of biquotient manifolds.</description>

      <title>On P^1-stabilization in unstable motivic homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze stabilization with respect to ${\mathbb P}^1$ in the Morel--Voevodsky unstable motivic homotopy theory. We introduce a refined notion of cellularity (a.k.a., biconnectivity) in various motivic homotopy categories taking into account both the simplicial and Tate circles. Under suitable cellularity hypotheses, we refine the Whitehead theorem by showing that a map of nilpotent motivic spaces can be seen to be an equivalence if it so after taking (Voevodsky) motives. We then establish a version of the Freudenthal suspension theorem for ${\mathbb P}^1$-suspension, again under suitable cellularity hypotheses. As applications, we resolve Murthy's conjecture on splitting of corank $1$ vector bundles on smooth affine algebras over algebraically closed fields having characteristic $0$ and compute new unstable motivic homotopy of motivic spheres.</description>

      <title>Interval Replacements of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08308v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two notions. The first one is a $rank\ compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $\xi_I \colon I^{\xi} \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^{\xi}$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under another compression system $\zeta$. This is applied to the case where $\xi = \mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M\'emoli, to give an alternative proof of the Dey--Kim--M\'emoli theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path.</description>
