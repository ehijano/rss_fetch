      <title>A New Tensor Norm That Preserves Unconditional Bases in Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a tensor norm on the class of all algebaic tensor products of Banach spaces $E\otimes F$. We say that $\alpha$ preserves unconditionality if the completion $E\otimes_{\alpha} F$ admits an unconditional basis for every pair of Banach spaces $E$ and $F$ that have unconditional bases. It is well known that none of Grothendieck's 14 tensor norms satisfies this unconditionality condition. Moreover, the exsistence of a tensor norm $\alpha$ preserving unconditionality remains an open question. In this paper, we construct, for every pair of Banach spaces $E$ and $F$ with unconditional bases a new tensor norm $\alpha$ that preserves unconditionality.</description>

      <title>Universal Gluing and Contextual Choice: Categorical Logic and the Foundations of Analytic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new categorical and constructive foundation for analytic approximation based on a Contextual Choice Principle (CCP), which enforces locality and compatibility in the construction of mathematical objects. Central to our approach is the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT), which establishes that functions in broad spaces -- including C(K), Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Omega), and distributions D'(Omega) -- can be explicitly approximated by finite-rank linear projections, each with a constructive, algorithmically verifiable certificate of accuracy.
  These constructions are governed categorically by a functorial adjunction between local logical probes and analytic models, making analytic existence both formally certifiable and programmatically extractable. As a key result, we prove a uniform certificate stability theorem, ensuring that approximation certificates persist under uniform convergence.
  The CCP avoids classical pathologies (e.g., non-measurable sets, Banach--Tarski paradoxes) by eliminating non-constructive choice and replacing it with a coherent, local-to-global semantic logic. Our framework strengthens the foundations of constructive analysis while contributing tools relevant to formal verification, type-theoretic proof systems, and computational mathematics.</description>

      <title>Shifted Pitt and uncertainty inequalities on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our primary objective is to study Pitt-type inequalities on Riemannian symmetric spaces $\mathbb{X}$ of noncompact type, as well as within the framework of Jacobi analysis. Inspired by the spectral gap of the Laplacian on $\mathbb{X}$, we introduce the notion of a \textit{shifted} Pitt's inequality as a natural and intrinsic analogue tailored to symmetric spaces, capturing key aspects of the underlying non-Euclidean geometry. In the rank one case (in particular, for hyperbolic spaces), we show that the sufficient condition for the \textit{shifted} Pitt's inequality matches the necessary condition in the range $p \leq q \leq p'$, yielding a sharp characterization of admissible polynomial weights with non-negative exponents.
  In the Jacobi setting, we modify the transform so that the associated measure exhibits polynomial volume growth. This modification enables us to fully characterize the class of polynomial weights with non-negative exponents for which Pitt-type inequalities hold for the modified Jacobi transforms. As applications of the \textit{shifted} Pitt's inequalities, we derive $L^2$-type Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty inequalities and further establish generalized $L^p$ versions. Moreover, the geometric structure of symmetric spaces allows us to formulate a broader version of the uncertainty inequalities previously obtained by Ciatti-Cowling-Ricci in the setting of stratified Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Uncentered Fractional Maximal functions and mean oscillation spaces associated with dyadic Hausdorff content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the action of uncentered fractional maximal functions on mean oscillation spaces associated with the dyadic Hausdorff content $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}^{\beta}$ with $0&lt;\beta\leq n$. For $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; n$, we refine existing results concerning the action of the Euclidean uncentered fractional maximal function $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha}$ on the functions of bounded mean oscillations (BMO) and vanishing mean oscillations (VMO). In addition, for $0 &lt; \beta_1 \leq \beta_2 \leq n$, we establish the boundedness of the $\beta_2$-dimensional uncentered maximal function $\mathcal{M}^{\beta_2}$ on the space $\text{BMO}^{\beta_1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, where $\text{BMO}^{\beta_1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ denotes the mean oscillation space adapted to the dyadic Hausdorff content $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}^{\beta_1}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Weighted inequalities involving two Hardy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions on weights $u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2$, i.e. measurable, positive, and finite, a.e. on $(a,b)$, for which there exists a positive constant $C$ such that for given $0 &lt; p_1,q_1,p_2,q_2 &lt;\infty$ the inequality \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)^{p_2} v_2(s)^{p_2} ds\bigg)^{\frac{q_2}{p_2}} u_2(t)^{q_2} dt \bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_2}}&amp; \\ &amp; \hspace{-3cm}\le C \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)^{p_1} v_1(s)^{p_1} ds\bigg)^{\frac{q_1}{p_1}} u_1(t)^{q_1} dt \bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_1}} \end{split} \end{equation*} holds for every non-negative, measurable function $f$ on $(a,b)$, where $0 \le a &lt;b \le \infty$. The proof is based on a recently developed discretization method that enables us to overcome the restrictions of the earlier results.</description>

      <title>Littlewood--Paley estimates for pure-jump Dirichlet forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the recent generalization of the Hardy--Stein identity to extend the previous Littlewood--Paley estimates to general pure-jump Dirichlet forms. The results generalize those for symmetric pure-jump L\'evy processes in Euclidean spaces. We also relax the assumptions for the Dirichlet form necessary for the estimates used in previous works. To overcome the difficulty that It\^o's formula is not applicable, we employ the theory of Revuz correspondence and additive functionals. Meanwhile, we present a few counterexamples demonstrating that some inequalities do not hold in the generality considered in this paper. In particular, we correct errors that appear in previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new seminorm of $n$-tuple operators, which generalizes the $A$-Euclidean operator radius of $n$-tuple bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space. We introduce and study basic properties of this seminorm. As an application of the present study, we estimate bounds for the $A$-Euclidean operator radius ($A$-joint numerical radius). In addition, we improve on some of the important existing $A$-numerical radius inequalities and related results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear topological invariant $(\Omega)$ for a class of Fr\'echet spaces of holomorphic functions of rapid decay on strip-like domains in the complex plane, defined via weight function systems. We obtain a complete characterization of the property $(\Omega)$ for such spaces in terms of an explicit condition on the defining weight function systems. As an application, we investigate the surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann operator on certain weighted spaces of vector-valued smooth functions.</description>

Abstract: In 1996, Meshulam proved that every sequence generated by applying projections onto affine subspaces, drawn from a finite collection in Euclidean space, must be bounded.
  In this paper, we extend his result not only from affine subspaces to convex polyhedral subsets, but also from Euclidean to general Hilbert space. Various examples are provided to illustrate the sharpness of the results.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck duality and sparse minimizing in spaces of Sobolev solutions to elliptic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an instructive example of using Banach spaces of solutions to (linear, generally, non-scalar) elliptic operator $A$ to investigate variational inverse problems related to neural networks and/or to regularization of solutions to boundary value problems. More precisely, inspired by kernel's method for optimization problems in locally convex spaces, we prove the existence of the so-called sparse minimizers for the related variational problem and produce a representer theorem where a suitable fundamental solution of the operator $A$ is used as a reproducing kernel. The Grothendieck type duality for the Sobolev spaces of solutions to elliptic operator $A$ plays an essential role in the considerations. The case where the number of data passes to infinity is also discussed. Some typical situations related to the standard elliptic operators, the corresponding function spaces and fundamental solutions are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Polyak's stepsize has recently gained renewed attention in stochastic optimization. Recently, Orvieto, Lacoste-Julien, and Loizou introduced a decreasing variant of Polyak's stepsize, where convergence relies on a boundedness assumption of the iterates. They established that this assumption holds under strong convexity. In this paper, we extend their result by proving that boundedness also holds for a broader class of objective functions, including coercive functions. We also present a case in which boundedness may or may not hold.</description>

The purpose of this paper is to obtain the complete boundedness of singular integrals on weighted flag and product Hardy spaces. In particular, we prove the boundedness of one-parameter singular integrals on both weighted flag and product Hardy spaces, as well as the boundedness of flag singular integrals on weighted product Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of iterative regularization method assisted by the graph Laplacian with early stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-assisted iterative regularization method for solving ill-posed inverse problems in Hilbert space settings. The proposed approach, termed \texttt{IRMGL+\(\Psi\)}, integrates classical iterative techniques with a data-driven regularization term realized through an iteratively updated graph Laplacian. Our method commences by computing a preliminary solution using any suitable reconstruction method, which then serves as the basis for constructing the initial graph Laplacian. The solution is subsequently refined through an iterative process, where the graph Laplacian is simultaneously recalibrated at each step to effectively capture the evolving structure of the solution. A key innovation of this work lies in the formulation of this iterative scheme and the rigorous justification of the classical discrepancy principle as a reliable early stopping criterion specifically tailored to the proposed method. Under standard assumptions, we establish stability and convergence results for the scheme when the discrepancy principle is applied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments utilizing four distinct initial reconstructors $\Psi$: the adjoint operator (Adj), filtered back projection (FBP), total variation (TV) denoising, and standard Tikhonov regularization (Tik). It is observed that \texttt{IRMGL+Adj} demonstrates a distinct advantage over the other initializers, producing a robust and stable approximate solution directly from a basic initial reconstruction.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional bounded mean oscillation operator theory I: sparse domination, sparse $T1$ theorem, off-diagonal extrapolation, quantitative weighted estimate -- for generalized commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies a class of multilinear fractional bounded mean oscillation operators (denoted {\rm $m$-FBMOOs}) defined on ball-basis measure spaces $(X, \mu, \mathcal{B})$. These operators serve as a generalization of canonical classes, such as the multilinear fractional maximal operators, the multilinear fractional Ahlfors-Beurling operators, the multilinear pseudo-differential operators with multi-parameter H\"ormander symbol, and some multilinear operators admitting $\mathbb{V}$-valued $m$-linear fractional Dini-type Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel representation. Crucially, the definition utilized here, incorporating the notion of "bounded mean oscillation," provides greater generality compared to those in Karagulyan (2019) and Cao et al. (2023). Our investigation systematically examines the properties of these operators and their generalized commutators through the lens of modern harmonic analysis, focusing on two principal directions: 1.We establish Karagulyan-type sparse domination for the generalized commutators. Subsequently, by developing bespoke dyadic representation theorems pertinent to this setting, we prove a corresponding multilinear fractional sparse $T1$ theorem for these generalized commutators. 2.With sparse bounds established, we obtain weighted estimates in multiple complementary methods: (1) Under a novel class of multilinear fractional weights, we prove four types of weighted inequalities: sharp-type, Bloom-type, mixed weak-type, and local decay-type.(2) We develop a multilinear non-diagonal extrapolation framework for these weights, which transfers boundedness flexibly among weighted spaces and establishes corresponding vector-valued inequalities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we improve the lower estimate of multidimensional Bohr radius for unit ball of $\ell^n_q$-spaces ($1\leq q\leq \infty$) for bounded holomorphic functions with values in finite dimensional complex Banach spaces. The new estimate provides the improved lower bound for the Bohr radius which was previously given by Defant, Maestre, and Schwarting [Adv. Math. 231 (2012), 2837--2857].</description>

Abstract: We prove a Schwarz-Jack lemma for holomorphic functions on the unit disk with the property that their maximum modulus on each circle about the origin is attained at a point on the positive real axis. With the help of this result, we establish monotonicity and convexity properties of conformal maps of circularly symmetric and bi-circularly symmetric domains. As an application, we give a new proof of Crouzeix's theorem that the numerical range of any $2\times 2$ matrix is a $2$-spectral set for the matrix. Unlike other proofs, our approach does not depend on the explicit formula for the conformal mapping of an ellipse onto the unit disk.</description>

      <title>(Non-)amenability of the Fourier algebra in the cb-multiplier norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.03252v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a locally compact group $G$, let $A(G)$ denote its Fourier algebra, $M_{cb}(A(G))$ the completely bounded multipliers of $A(G)$, and $A_{M_cb}(G)$ the closure of $A(G)$ in $M_{cb}(A(G))$. We show that, if $A_{M_cb}(G)$ is amenable, then $a(G_d)$, the almost periodic compactification of the discretization of $G$, has an abelian subgroup of finite index. As a consequence, $A_{M_cb}(G)$ cannot be amenable if $G$ contains a copy of $\free_2$, the free group in two generators, as a closed subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an useful in Variational Analysis tool -- Long Orbit or Empty Value (LOEV) principle -- in different settings, starting from more abstract to more defined.
  We prove, using LOEV principle, a number of basic results in Variational Analysis, including some novel. We characterize $\Sigma_g$-semicompleteness for a generalized metric function $g$ which is neither symmetric nor satisfies the triangle inequality, in terms of validity of Ekeland Theorem for this $g$. We present an interesting application to perturbability to minimum in a $G_\delta$ subset of a complete metric space.</description>

      <title>Complementation in Continuous Cohomology with Coefficients in Banach Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the concept of weakly uniquely stationary representations. This framework enables us to investigate the complementability of closed subspaces within the context of continuous cohomology with coeffcients in Banach modules. As an application, we extend and refine several cohomological results from the literature, particularly in the settings of nilpotent groups, products of groups, and lattices.</description>

      <title>Admissibility of Multi-window Gabor Systems in Periodically Supported $\ell^2$-spaces with Vector-valued Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, \( L, M, N, R \) are positive integers, and \( \mathbb{S} \) is an \( N \)-periodic subset of \( \mathbb{Z} \). The space \( \ell^2(\mathbb{S}, \mathbb{C}^R) \) denotes the Hilbert space of vector-valued square-summable sequences over \( \mathbb{S} \), with values in the complex Euclidean space \( \mathbb{C}^R \).
  We consider the (multi-window) Gabor system \( \mathcal{G}(g, L, M, N, R) \), generated by applying translations with parameter \( nN \), \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \), and modulations with parameter \( \frac{m}{M} \), \( m \in \mathbb{N}_M \), to a collection of sequences \( g = \{g_l\}_{l \in \mathbb{N}_L} \subset \ell^2(\mathbb{S}, \mathbb{C}^R) \).
  Using the vector-valued Zak transform, we characterize the class of sequences \( g \), called windows, that generate a complete Gabor system or a Gabor frame in \( \ell^2(\mathbb{S}, \mathbb{C}^R) \). Furthermore, we provide admissibility conditions under which the periodic set \( \mathbb{S} \) supports a complete Gabor system, a Parseval Gabor frame, or an orthonormal Gabor basis, expressed in terms of the parameters \( L \), \( M \), \( N \), and \( R \).</description>

      <title>Hypercyclicity of Weighted shifts on weighted Bergman and Dirichlet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $B_w$ and $F_w$ denote, respectively, the weighted backward and forward shift operators defined on the weighted Bergman space $A^p_{\phi}$, or the weighted Dirichlet space ${D}^p_{\phi}$ of the unit disc, where the weight function $\phi(z)$ is mostly radial. We first obtain sufficient conditions for $B_w$ and $F_w$ to be continuous on these spaces. For radial weights, we derive norm estimates for coefficient functionals on $A^p_{\phi}$ and $D^p_{\phi}$, and using those estimates we infer when the weighted shifts or their adjoints are hypercyclic. We also deal with a non-radial case.</description>

      <title>Amenability of group actions on compact spaces and the associated Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a topological group $G$, amenability can be characterized by the amenability of the convolution Banach algebra $L^1(G)$. Here a Banach algebra $A$ is called amenable if every bounded derivation from $A$ into any dual--type $A$--$A$--Banach bimodule is inner. We extend this classical result to the case of discrete group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces. By introducing a Banach algebra naturally associated with the action and adopting a suitably weakened notion of amenability for Banach algebras, we obtain an analogous characterization of amenable actions. As a lemma, we also proved a fixed--point property for amenable actions that strengthens the theorem of Dong and Wang (2015).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notions of the Euclidean surface area measure and the spherical surface area measure of $\alpha$-concave functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $-\frac{1}{n}&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, are introduced via a first variation of the total mass functional with respect to the $\alpha$-sum operation. Subsequently, these notions are extended to those for $\alpha$-concave measures. We then study the Minkowski problem associated with the Euclidean surface area measures of $\alpha$-concave measures via optimal transport.</description>

Abstract: Pointwise lower bounds on the open unit disc $\bbD$ for the sum of the moduli of two analytic functions $f$ and $g$ (or their derivatives) are known in several cases, like $f,g$ belonging to the Bloch space $\cB$, $BMOA$ or the weighted Hardy space $H_\omega^\infty$. We find complementary results of Ramey-Ullrich and Abakumov-Doubtsov for functions with little o conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast Convolutions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ via Radial Translational Dependence and Classical FFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ denote the right coset space of the subgroup consisting of translational isometries of the orthogonal lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ in the non-Abelian group of planar motions $SE(2)$. This paper develops a fast and accurate numerical scheme for approximation of functions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$. We address finite Fourier series of functions on the right coset space $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ using finite Fourier coefficients. The convergence/error analysis of finite Fourier coefficients are investigated. Conditions are established for the finite Fourier coefficients to converge to the Fourier coefficients. The matrix forms of the finite transforms are discussed. The implementation of the discrete method to compute numerical approximation of $SE(2)$-convolutions with functions which are radial in translations are considered. The paper is concluded by discussing capability of the numerical scheme to develop fast algorithms for approximating multiple convolutions with functions which are radial in translations.</description>

      <title>Fourier-based Inversion of Partial X-ray Transforms in n Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two theorems describing analytic left-inverses of partial X-ray transforms. The first theorem concerns X-ray data collected with an arbitrary distribution of parallel projections; it contains a convolution-backprojection formula and a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is sufficient. The second theorem concerns X-ray data collected with a cone-beam; it contains a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is amenable to this method (for example: (n-1)-dimensional source loci that `surround' the reconstruction support; detectors of finite size are supported). These theorems are the outcome of a modestly general and rigorous investigation undertaken into the existence of backprojection-convolution methods in n-dimensional space. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the experiment geometry are established for the existence of such methods, as are the particular error metrics minimised by backprojection-convolution methods and the uniqueness of those minimum-error solutions. A major practical outcome of this work is the production of the first known exact inversion methods for cone-beam geometries where the X-ray source point loci are multidimensional, such as (in 3D) a cylinder or a sphere of X-ray source positions. A separate article describes a practical computer implementation for the case of a cylinder in 3D.</description>
