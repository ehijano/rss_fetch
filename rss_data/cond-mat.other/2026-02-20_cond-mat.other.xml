      <title>Dual-purpose architected materials: Optimizing graded BCC lattices for crashworthiness and heat dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Body-centered Cubic (BCC) lattice structures demonstrate promising performance for applications that require simultaneous mechanical energy absorption and thermal management. However, current optimization approaches are typically confined to single-domain objectives, such as mechanical parameters like impact energy and peak stress, neglecting the role of multiple physics in real-world performance. To address this, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework for density-graded BCC lattices that effectively dissipates heat while maximizing absorbed impact energy. A parametric three-zone lattice configuration is investigated to explore various trade-offs between mechanical and thermal properties. Each design is evaluated through independent impact and forced-convection simulations using commercial solvers. Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) and peak stresses at the distal end quantify impact absorption performance, while the Nusselt number and pressure drop characterize thermal dissipation performance. Surrogate models constructed from this data enable multi-objective optimization via Goal Programming to identify an optimal design. Two Pareto-optimal lattice designs are identified with reduced pressure drop and peak stress, underlining the superiority of strategic density gradation. Analysis of the optimal designs reveals how material distribution and geometric design variables influence mechanical-thermal trade-offs, establishing quantitative design guidelines for lattice structures in this multi-physics application.</description>

      <title>$p$-wave magnet driven field-free Josephson diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions, has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically in models of bulk superconductors and Josephson junctions (JJs). In this work, we construct a Josephson junction using a recently discovered unconventional coplanar magnet, the $p$-wave magnet (PM), with proximity-induced superconductivity, and demonstrate the emergence of a Josephson diode effect (JDE). The barrier region is formed by another unconventional collinear magnet, namely an altermagnet (AM). We illustrate that apart from time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the mirror operation $M_{yz}$ emerges as the key symmetry constraint. Also, unlike earlier models that realize the JDE using unconventional magnets, this setup does not require Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or different superconductors across the junction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the realization of the JDE in this framework requires only minimal conditions while maintaining high performance. The effect remains robust across a broad parameter regime, and thus making the system particularly promising for applications in quantum circuits and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Photoluminescence Signatures of Magneto-Optical Coupling in Layered Hybrid Manganese Chloride Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between magnetic ordering and light emission is crucial for developing magneto-optical technologies. However, this phenomenon is poorly understood since observations of this coupling vary significantly across materials. In this context, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) that incorporate Mn2+ ions are a chemically and structurally tunable platform for exploring this phenomenon, since they exhibit magnetic ordering and photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we study two antiferromagnetic Mn-based HOIPs with different organic cations that result in distinct lattice stiffness, Mn2+-Mn2+ distance and octahedral distortion. Temperature-dependent PL excitation spectroscopy reveals changes in crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters well above the N\'eel temperature (TN), indicating the emergence of Mn2+-Mn2+ magnetic interactions prior to reach long-range magnetic ordering. These variations align with the observed changes in temperature-PL evolution. The compound with a more rigid lattice shows stronger changes closer to TN, suggesting combined effects of magnetic polarons and spin-canting. In contrast, magnetic polaron-induced magnetic modifications prevail in the HOIP with a softer lattice. These results reveal the complexity of the magneto-optical coupling in Mn-based HOIPs and provide new insights into this field extensible to other 2D materials that exhibit this phenomenon with potential for advanced magneto-optical applications.</description>

      <title>Detecting nonequilibrium phase transitions via continuous monitoring of space-time trajectories and autoencoder-based clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of collective behavior and nonequilibrium phase transitions in quantum systems is typically rooted in the analysis of suitable system observables, so-called order parameters. These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes.</description>

      <title>Charge and energy transport in graphene with smooth finite-range disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate charge and energy transport in monolayer graphene with smooth finite-range disorder, modeled by soft impurity potentials. Using a continuum Dirac model, we go beyond the Born approximation by computing the exact scattering matrix for individual impurities. This captures the full nonperturbative physics of smooth disorder. From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail. These findings provide a more accurate transport characterization for disordered Dirac materials and clarify how smooth disorder governs energy flow in graphene.</description>

      <title>First-principles Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian Construction for Chemisorbed Hydrogen at Metal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian is widely used to describe adsorption at gas-solid interfaces, yet its construction typically relies on simplifying assumptions such as constant coupling and the wideband limit approximation. Here, we present a first-principles approach to construct Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians by applying projection operator diabatisation to Hamiltonian matrices obtained from Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations. We demonstrate this method for chemisorbed hydrogen on three fcc metal(111) surfaces: Al, Cu, and Pt. To validate the electronic coupling between adsorbed hydrogen and the metal surface, we compute the projected density of states, electronic tunnelling lifetimes, and vibrational lifetimes from the constructed Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians and find good agreement with reference calculations. Analysis of the chemisorption function reveals that the wideband limit approximation is valid for H/Al(111) but has limited applicability for H/Cu(111) and H/Pt(111).</description>

      <title>Analytical solution of boundary time crystals via the superspin basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in dissipative collective spin systems have been extensively studied using numerical, mean-field, and perturbative approaches. However, an explicit Liouvillian description governing the long-time dynamics deep within the time crystal phase has remained elusive. Here, we derive an effective Liouvillian that analytically captures the extreme BTC regime, where dissipation is parametrically weak and oscillatory order is maximally robust. By introducing a superspin representation of Liouville space, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Liouvillian eigenvalues to first order in the dissipation strength, providing direct access to decay rates, oscillation frequencies, and their thermodynamic scaling. Applying this framework to the canonical BTC model we analytically recover spontaneous breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry and persistent oscillations in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, we show that other dissipative spin models exhibit only single-frequency oscillatory dynamics and therefore do not support genuine BTC phases. Our results establish a controlled analytical framework for the long-time dynamics in the extreme BTC regime.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)] has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour, observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number, suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with high-order squeezing states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gates via Dynamical Decoupling of Central Qubit on IBMQ and 15NV Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a hardware-agnostic protocol for realizing fast, high-fidelity gates through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. The target qubits are controlled by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow, error-prone direct control. We develop and implement the DD-gate protocol within two distinct frameworks: a general model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked on a gate-based digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with a nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Using IBMQ, we are able to elucidate the underlying quantum dynamics of the DD-gates and test them, independently of experimental constraints. For $^{15}$NV, we realize the protocol considering system-specific properties, which could represent a significant reduction in gate duration and improved technological scalability compared with current dynamical-decoupling-based control. We also propose a simple application for high-efficiency polarization of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin that could potentially be less technically demanding than current methods. Altogether, this work provides a robust strategy for quantum control that can be implemented in arbitrary systems fitting the central-target qubit architecture. Beyond these results, our open-source simulations and implementations for both platforms provide a practical framework for simulating time-dependent qubit dynamics on NISQ-era gate-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck approach for thermal fluctuations in antiferromagnetic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Fokker-Planck approach to describe the dynamics of staggered magnetization and thermal fluctuations in a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic system with uniaxial anisotropy. Beginning with a classical model for the antiferromagnetic system, we incorporate a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented by Langevin fields to account for thermal fluctuations, and we derive the Fokker-Planck equation governing the probability distribution function of the spin configuration. Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt% and 50 g H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;ulti-binding &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;ites &lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt;nited in &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;ovalent-&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;rganic &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (FeCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt% and 72.6 g H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15-20 kJ/mol) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.</description>
