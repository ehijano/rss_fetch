      <title>Testing models for fully and partially stripped low-mass stars with Gaia: Implications for hot subdwarfs, binary RR Lyrae, and black hole impostors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When low-mass ($\lesssim 2$ $M_{\odot}$) red giants lose their envelopes to a companion just before the helium flash, the resulting mass transfer can produce binaries hosting hot subdwarfs, horizontal branch stars, and undermassive red clump stars. Recent work predicts a continuum of such products, from fully stripped hot subdwarfs to partially stripped horizontal branch and red clump stars, and suggests that young, metal-rich RR Lyrae can form when partial stripping leaves a helium-burning star in the instability strip. To enable direct comparison with observations, we model these binaries in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map, generate epoch astrometry using Gaia's scanning law, and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models applied in Gaia DR3. We compare the simulated population to DR3 observations of hot subdwarfs, RR Lyrae, and red giants with high astrometric mass functions. The model significantly overpredicts the number of hot subdwarfs with astrometric binary solutions, partly because the predicted flux ratios are more unequal than observed. It also predicts $\gtrsim 100$ RR Lyrae with DR3 astrometric orbital solutions, while none are observed. We conclude that RR Lyrae in au-scale binaries may be substantially rarer than predicted. In contrast, the model plausibly explains the population of red clump stars with high astrometric mass functions, which we interpret as potential black hole impostors. We predict that $\sim 10 \times$ more stripped-star binaries will be detectable in DR4, whose sensitivity to longer periods will more strongly test wide-orbit systems.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the [C/N] and [Y/Mg] chemical clocks with asteroseismic ages from the TESS space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Stellar ages are typically very difficult to estimate for field stars. New empirical methods, based on abundance ratios of chemical elements, are emerging and need to be calibrated. Aims. Our main aim is to contribute to revealing relations between [C/N] and [Y/Mg] ratios and stellar ages by determining astroseismic ages and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances, and accounting for stellar evolutionary stages and birth places in the Galaxy. Methods. We searched for solar pulsations in a sample of 1250 bright F, G, and K giants using data from the TESS space telescope and determined asteroseismic ages using the BASTA and PARAM codes. For the [Y/Mg] relations with age, we determined abundances accounting for deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. For the [C/N] relations with age, we separated stars according to their evolutionary stages. Results. We determined asteroseismic ages for 218 giants and derived [Y/Mg] and [C/N] relations with age for subsamples of stars in three regions of the Galactic thin disc and the thick disc. Conclusions. The [Y/Mg]-age relation exhibits a clear radial dependence across the Galactic disc, with a steeper trend in the outer disc, progressively flatter relations towards the inner disc, and a very flat trend in the thick disc. NLTE abundances of Mg and especially of Y have to be used in order to obtain a more precise stellar age evaluation from [Y/Mg] ratios. When using [C/N] abundance ratios as stellar age indicators, evolutionary stages of stars have to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of the Convective Urca Process in 3D Simulations of a Simmering White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae are bright thermonuclear explosions that are important to numerous areas of astronomy. However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.</description>

      <title>Retarded Stellar Dynamo in Tidally Deformed M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current studies of stellar dynamos primarily focus on spherical stars, leaving their behavior in distorted stars largely unexplored. We utilize stars of varying distortions to examine the relation between stellar cycle periods ($P_{\rm cyc}$) and rotational periods ($P_{\rm rot}$), which are closely linked to dynamo processes. By analyzing a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, we identify an anti-correlation between $P_{\rm cyc}$ and $P_{\rm rot}$, in contrast to the lack of such a relation in single M dwarfs. This means that stars with greater deformation have longer cycle periods, suggesting variations in dynamo behavior under non-spherical geometries. Our numerical simulations further reveal that, the thermal convection weakens in highly distorted stars, and subsequently, the differential rotation is also reduced. These effects may lengthen the conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, potentially explaining the newly discovered $P_{\rm cyc}$-$P_{\rm rot}$ relation in cataclysmic variables.</description>

      <title>Is Mira B a low mass white dwarf?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report photometric observations in Johnson B and V bands of the short term variability (flickering) of Mira (omicron Ceti). The observations were performed during 7 nights in the period August - October 2025, in the course of the last minimum of the Mira pulsations. The observed peak-to-peak amplitude of the flickering is 0.11-0.28 mag in B band. For the flickering source we find luminosity in the range 0.10-0.46 L_sun. Using the amplitude-flux relation, we estimate an average luminosity of the accretion disc L_d = 0.91 +/- 0.28 L_sun.
  Assuming that the white dwarf accretes material through Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLOF), we find that Mira B is a low mass white dwarf with M_wd = 0.24 +/- 0.04 M_sun accreting at a rate 6.8x10^{-9} M_sun/yr. This value of the mass is in the range of the extremely low mass white dwarfs.

      <title>Sub-second cadence structure of optical flares on AD Leo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares are sudden brightenings caused by magnetic reconnection and are frequently observed on late-type stars. High-cadence photometry of flares provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of these events, yet such observations remain scarce. We seek to explore the sub-second fine structure of stellar flares and assess the information content in high-speed photometry. New 0.3 s-cadence photometry from a six-year-long observing campaign of the active M-dwarf AD Leo is presented. We use time--frequency analysis to detect quasi-periodic pulsations in the decay phase of flares. We explore statistical measures of time series complexity of the detected flares to quantify the information gain achievable with high-cadence photometry. We detect 42 flares in 211 hours of observations. The flare frequency distribution is consistent with the previous literature. We find no quasi-periodic pulsations with periods below a few seconds, and identify two candidate signals with periods around 1 and 3 min. Using different measures of complexity on the binned flare light curves we confirm the advantages of high observing cadence. However, we also find a plateau up to a binning of ~4--5 s for a few complex flares, suggesting that an exposure time of a few seconds is usually enough to retain most of the information carried by a single-filter observation. New photometric observations of AD Leo revealed sub-structures of flare light curves on the timescale of a few seconds, but we found no features on timescales below that.</description>

      <title>The accretion discs in WZ Sge-type stars in deep quiescence. How do they outburst?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WZ Sge-type stars are an extreme subclass of dwarf novae characterised by very rare, large-amplitude superoutbursts. Within the disc instability model (DIM), such events are explained as being triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor star. We present an analysis of observations of a sample of WZ Sge-type systems in deep quiescence to assess the consistency of DIM predictions with their observed properties. We find that accretion discs in quiescent WZ Sge-type systems have very low mass-accretion rates of a few $\times$$10^{-13}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The discs are entirely optically thin, and their physical conditions -- such as surface density and effective temperature -- remain well below the DIM thresholds required to trigger an outburst. Observationally, no increase in disc brightness is detected prior to the superoutburst, indicating the absence of a transition to an optically thick state, in contrast to DIM predictions of a gradual disc thickening preceding the instability. We therefore find no observational evidence that superoutbursts in WZ Sge-type systems are triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor. Furthermore, the inferred mass-transfer rates in these objects ($\dot{M}_{\rm tr}$~5$\times$$10^{-12}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are at least an order of magnitude lower than commonly assumed. We argue that the widely adopted value of $\dot{M}_{\rm tr}$ for the prototype object WZ Sge is likely overestimated. Finally, we show that in quiescence the accretion disc radius in all systems is close to the tidal truncation radius and exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius, confirming earlier results and calling into question the standard interpretation of superhump formation.</description>

      <title>A deep HST view of the open cluster NGC2158: binaries, mass functions, and M-dwarf discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of stars in both the Galactic field and stellar clusters are members of binary systems. Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of five Mira stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mira stars are popular with amateur astronomers because they are generally bright and their pulsations produce large changes in brightness. This also means they are eminently suitable to study using spectroscopy. We report here on spectroscopic observations of five Mira stars: RY Cep, SU Cam, T Cep, V667 Cas and OR Cep. We describe the lifecycle of a Mira star and explain how the carbon-oxygen balance in its atmosphere determines its spectral classification. Atmospheric pulsations in these stars produce shocks which generate Balmer emission. We present graphically their different spectral behaviours and development of emission lines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update and expand the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) database to include variations in the alpha-capture elements, specifically [alpha/Fe]=-0.2, 0, +0.2, +0.4, and +0.6 for -3 &lt;= [Fe/H] &lt;= +0.5. Variations in [alpha/Fe] are included in a self-consistent manner from the stellar interior models to the synthetic spectra used to translate these models in the observational plane. We describe a number of updates to the physics utilized in these models as well as new information provided by the models. We validate the models with comparisons to other stellar evolution models including the previous generation of MIST and other models from the literature. MIST data products including stellar evolutiont tracks, isochrones, and bolometric correction tables can be obtained from the MIST project website, https://mist.science. All necessary files to reproduce MIST models are available from Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Dynamical masses of YSOs with the VLBA: DYNAMO VLBA: Trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of YSOs in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of compact radio sources in the Orion complex, conducted within both the DYNAMO-VLBA and the GOBELINS projects. Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\pm12$ pc for the $\sigma$ Orionis region, $388.5\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($\Delta\varpi=-0.02\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame. Our results demonstrate the capability of high-precision radio astrometry to map embedded stellar populations and to provide an independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions.</description>

      <title>Tests of general relativity in pseudo-Newtonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potentials can reproduce classic tests of general relativity without resorting to full general relativistic formalisms. This is useful for the researchers seeking intuitive insight into relativistic gravity. Focusing on the perihelion precession of Mercury, gravitational redshift, and gravitational light bending, we derive analytical expressions for orbital precession and demonstrate that, with suitable physically acceptable parameters, pseudo-Newtonian approaches can accurately reproduce the observed perihelion advance and gravitational redshift. However, we confirm that no single potential consistently captures all relativistic effects. In particular, while certain parameters yield agreement with general relativity for planetary motion and redshift, they fail to reproduce gravitational lensing over a broad range of impact parameters. Our results highlight both the usefulness and limitations of pseudo-Newtonian methods in modeling gravitational phenomena. Although the pseudo-Newtonian approach cannot serve as universal substitutes for general relativity, especially in strong-field regimes, it provides valuable semi-analytical insight and pedagogical simplicity. Our results indicate the usefulness of the pseudo-Newtonian approach to uncover more complicated phenomena involved with strong field gravity in possibly modification to general relativity.</description>

      <title>A Path to an All-Sky Survey with Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep, space-based, all-sky near-infrared survey carried out with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would constitute a foundational astronomical infrastructure for decades to come. In this white paper, we present a concrete and feasible path to imaging the entire sky at $\sim0.1''$ resolution, beginning with high-impact fields in Cycle 1 and scaling to ultra-wide coverage within the nominal mission. This first-epoch survey will reach $\mathrm{H}\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$\sigma$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science. We invite broad community participation in shaping and carrying out both the initial program and the long-term vision of an all-sky Roman survey.</description>

      <title>The DECam MAGIC Survey: Uncovering the Tidal Tails of the Crater II Dwarf Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crater II (CraII), a large and low-density dwarf spheroidal galaxy, has unusual observed properties that are difficult to reproduce in cold dark matter simulations. Ongoing tidal disruption may help explain the discrepancies, as evidenced by the recent discovery of tidal tails. Here we present metallicity-sensitive narrowband photometry of the Ca II H and K lines from the Dark Energy Camera, covering $128$ deg$^2$ across the center and identified tidal tails of CraII as part of the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey. Our combined photometric metallicity, color-magnitude, proper motion, and parallax selections identify 162 CraII candidates. Of these, 37 candidates are located in the tidal tails which extend at least $7^\circ$ ($\sim 95$ kpc) from the center of CraII, suggesting it has lost $\gtrsim 25$% of its initial stellar mass. We confirm low contamination rates with dedicated control fields and highlight the extremely low surface brightness stellar features that can be uncovered with CaHK data, as faint as $\sim 36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We also make the first detection of a metallicity gradient ($-0.34\pm0.17~{\rm dex}~{\rm deg}^{-1}$) in the center of the galaxy and infer a stream width of $w\sim 0.8^\circ$, roughly 50% larger than the CraII half-light radius. The detection of candidates in the most distant CraII pointings from its center implies that the tidal tails extend beyond our footprint. We compare the CraII stream to $N$-body models with "cored" and "cuspy" dark matter halo progenitors, determining that CraII's density profile is still ambiguous and warrants further modeling.</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic fields and dust properties in the young embedded star-forming region AFGL 6366S using Near Infrared and Optical linear polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Near-Infrared (NIR) and Optical linear polarimetry towards the partially embedded cluster AFGL 6366S. The polarization ranges from 0.44-10.3 per cent in NIR and 0.16-11.22 per cent in Optical bands. The position angle spans $1^\circ - 179^\circ$ in both NIR and Optical bands. About 22 stars exhibit intrinsic polarization signatures. A polarization hole is evident towards the densest ($\sim 3.4 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and warmest ($\sim 28.8 \mathrm{K}$) central cluster region. It is attributable to depolarization induced by Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) of large grains and a modest contribution from magnetic-field tangling. The local magnetic field towards the cluster's central region is significantly misaligned with both the large-scale Galactic field and the long axis of the filament present in the region. The field morphology wraps around two dense molecular clumps of radii 0.34 pc and 0.22 pc and $\mathrm N(\mathrm H_2)$ = $(7.9 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $(4.3 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The clumps are embedded in the filamentary structure and represent locally accelerated stages of mass accumulation. Gravitationally driven mass flows, largely perpendicular to the local magnetic field, produce a U-shaped field curvature across the filament axis. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths towards the two clumps are $ 447.91 \pm 83.81 \mu\mathrm{G}$ and $396.66 \pm 73.64 \mu\mathrm{G}$. The corresponding mass-to-flux ratios ($\lambda \sim 1.34$ and $0.82$) indicate that one clump is magnetically supercritical and the other is subcritical. The Alfven Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}_A$) $\sim$ 0.395 and 0.393 indicate that both the clumps are in sub-Alfv\'enic state.</description>

      <title>Classical, large scale 3D MHD simulations of interacting pulsar wind nebulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetized rotating neutron stars, or pulsars, are a possible end product of massive star evolution. Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor.</description>

      <title>pythonradex: a fast Python re-implementation of RADEX with extended functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common task in astronomical research is to estimate the physical parameters (temperature, mass, density etc.) of a gas by using observed line emission. This often requires a calculation of how the radiation propagates via emission and absorption (so-called radiative transfer). In radio and infrared astronomy, the Fortran code RADEX (van der Tak et al., 2007) is a popular tool to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer of a uniform medium in a simplified geometry. I present pythonradex, a Python re-implementation of RADEX. Written in Python, it provides an easy and intuitive user interface, improved performance as well as additional functionality not included in RADEX, such as continuum effects and overlapping lines. In addition, pythonradex provides a self-consistent computation of the total flux for all geometries, including spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>Analysis of eigenvalue clustering leads to optimal scaling in numerical radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a multidimensional polychromatic radiative transfer (RT) problem, accounting for scattering processes in a general form, i.e. anisotropic (dipole) scattering with partial frequency redistribution. Given a discrete ordinates discretization, we report the corresponding matrix structures, depending on model and discretization parameters. Despite the possibly dense nature of these matrices, the use of Krylov methods is effective (especially in the matrix-free context) and robust. We propose a theoretical analysis, using the spectral tools of the symbol theory, explaining why Krylov convergence is robust w.r.t. all the discretization parameters, even in the unpreconditioned case. In fact, the compactness of the continuous operators used in the modeling leads to zero-clustered dense matrix sequences plus identity, so that the clustering at the unity of the spectra is deduced. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results, which have a direct application, for example, in the simulation of radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres, a key problem in astrophysical research. In general, we demonstrate that optimal scaling with respect to RT discretization parameters is expected for Krylov solution strategies.</description>

      <title>Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium XII. SN 2024acyl: A fast, linearly declining Type Ibn supernova with early flash-ionisation features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type Ibn supernova (SN) 2024acyl. It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at $(3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P Cygni He I lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C III, N III, and He II. The P Cygni He I features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. Our multi-band light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ M$_\odot$ with a kinetic energy of $E_{\rm k} = 0.06^{+0.01}_{-0.01} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.018$ M$_\odot$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm CSM} = 0.51^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$, an inner radius of $R_0 = 17.8^{+3.6}_{-3.0}$ AU, and a density of $\rho_{\rm CSM} =(8.3_{-1.2}^{+2.7})\times10^{-12}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/he4p0 model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4 M$_\odot$ (H-ZAMS mass 18.11 M$_\odot$, pre-SN mass 3.16 M$_\odot$). These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.</description>

      <title>Relationship Between Major Stellar Physical Parameters and Normal Mode Frequencies in Accreting White Dwarf Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) are the final fate of about 97\% of the stars in our galaxy, making them vital tracers of stellar history. A fraction of WDs exist in cataclysmic variable (CV) systems, accreting matter from a nearby companion star. A subset of CVs undergo episodic rapid mass transfer, termed dwarf novae (DNe) outbursts. Some accreting WDs exhibit near sinusoidal photometric variations, interpreted as $g$ mode pulsations. However, identifying pulsation modes in accreting WDs remains challenging due to the paucity of available observed modes. In this work, we present a comprehensive computation of the observable $g$ mode frequencies across a range of WD parameters, varying the WD mass, size of the newly accreted layer and core temperature. We also introduce a novel method for mode identification based on the time evolution of pulsation periods following an accretion episode. Our mode identification method does not rely on the direct detection of the consecutive radial mode orders, frequently required in isolated WDs. Moreover, this work improves upon our previous WD modeling efforts. We use a more realistic core temperature in addition to thermohaline mixing and element diffusion enabled during the accretion phase.</description>

      <title>A Test of Substellar Evolutionary Models with High-Precision Ages from Asteroseismology and Gyrochronology for the Benchmark System HR 7672AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-precision measurements for HR~7672AB, composed of a Sun-like (G0V) star and an L~dwarf companion. Three nights of precise (70 cm/s) radial velocity (RV) asteroseismology with the Keck Planet Finder clearly detect 5-minute oscillations from the primary HR~7672A, and modeling of the frequency spectrum yields an asteroseismic age of $1.87\pm0.65$~Gyr. We also determine a gyrochronological age of $2.58\pm0.47$~Gyr, and we combine these two results for a final age of $2.26\pm0.40$~Gyr. In addition, we obtained new RVs for HR~7672A and new astrometry for the companion HR~7672B. From a joint orbit fit, we measured a dynamical mass of $1.111\pm0.017$~$\text{M}_\odot$ for HR~7672A and $75.39\pm0.67$~$\text{M}_{\text{Jup}}$ for HR~7672B. This places the companion near the stellar/substellar boundary and thus particularly sensitive to differences in model predictions. The joint precision in host star age (18\% uncertainty) and companion mass (0.9\% uncertainty) makes HR~7672AB an exceptional substellar benchmark. Combined with the companion's luminosity, we use these measurements to test predictions from six brown dwarf cooling models. The best agreement occurs with the Chabrier et al. (2023) models, which incorporate a new equation of state, resulting in predictions that agree within $&lt;$0.3$\sigma$ with all the observations. The other 5 sets of models agree at the 1--3$\sigma$ level depending on the particular test, and some models struggle to predict a sufficient low luminosity for HR~7672B at any age given its dynamical mass. We also detected a weak seismic signal in near-simultaneous TESS photometry of HR~7672A, with the resulting RV-to-photometry oscillation amplitude ratio consistent with solar values.</description>

      <title>Varying core-envelope coupling efficiency identified from stellar rotation--activity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-envelope coupling provides a reasonable explanation of the spin-down stalling of stars in open clusters, which was not predicted by classical gyrochronology. However, it remains an open question whether the coupling efficiency is constant or variable. M dwarfs, possessing thicker convective envelopes and thus longer coupling timescales than other late-type stars, are ideal objects for this investigation. In this work, based on the $R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$ measurements from LAMOST and DESI spectra, we construct new rotation--activity relations for M dwarfs. Unlike the traditional picture, we suggest that the new relation consists of three distinct regimes of fast, intermediate, and slow rotation, closely matching the three sequences of gyrochronology, namely the ``Convective'' sequence, ``Gap'', and ``Interface'' sequence. Our study reveals, for the first time, a variable activity decay rate in the intermediate-rotation regime (i.e., the ``Gap'' region). This implies a varying core-envelope coupling efficiency, peaking towards the end of this region. It also coincides with the well-known stage of stalled stellar spin-down.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that temporal filtering can successfully identify local-acoustic-source wavefronts in radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere. Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) instrument on the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively).</description>

Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of luminous red nova (LRN) AT 2025abao, the fourth discovered in M 31. The LRN, associated to the AGB star WNTR23bzdiq, was discovered during the fast rise following the minimum phase. It reached the peak at $g=15.1$ mag ($M_g=-9.5\pm0.1$ mag), and then it settled onto a long-duration plateau in the red bands, lasting 70 days, while it was slowly linearly declining in the blue bands. The object showed similarities at peak with the canonical LRNe V838 Monocerotis, V1309 Scorpii, and with the faint and fast-evolving AT 2019zhd, the third LRN in M31, though the later evolution is different. Spectroscopically, AT 2025abao evolved as a canonical LRN: the early spectra present a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines in emission; at peak, the spectral continuum has cooled to a yellow colour, with a photospheric temperature of 6000 K. Balmer lines have weakened while absorption lines from metals (Fe I, Fe II, Sc II, Ba II, Ti II) have developed, and in particular broad (FWHM$\sim$700 km/s) from the UV Ca II H&amp;K lines. Medium- and high-resolution spectra reveal a counter-P Cygni absorption profile in H$\alpha$. Finally, late time spectra show an orange continuum ($T\sim$4000-5000 K), a return in strength of the Balmer lines and the formation of molecular absorption bands. AT 2025abao is the rare case of a LRN with detailed archival information regarding the progenitor system. For the first time, we obtained the spectral energy distribution in the infrared of the precursor of a LRN, which is consistent with that of an M giant/AGB. We propose that the dichotomy of light curve behaviour in LRNe (two peaks vs. plateau) can be explained by the extent and H-richness of the common envelope.</description>
