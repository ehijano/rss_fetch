      <title>Experimental Study of a Vortex Spin-Torque Oscillator in an MTJ with a Vortex Polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) are promising nanoscale microwave sources for spintronic applications, serving as signal generators or elements in neuromorphic computing systems. In this paper, we investigate the experimental realization of an oscillator based on a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) comprising two magnetic layers: a reference layer (RL) and a free layer (FL). We demonstrate that when magnetic vortices with opposite chirality and polarity are formed in the layers, the application of a current induces auto-oscillations even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect is observed in devices with diameters ranging from 800 to 1000 nm, exhibiting oscillation frequencies between 110 and 60 MHz. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the action of a spin current with vortex-like polarization injected from the RL, interacting with the magnetic vortex in the FL. This interaction generates a local out-of-plane effective field due to spin-transfer torque, which acts on the vortex core and initiates its motion. The observed mechanism differs qualitatively from the case of uniformly polarized spin currents perpendicular to the plane, where the resulting in-plane field acts on the planar components of the vortex magnetization.</description>

      <title>Directional Photocurrent Generated by Quantum Interference Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the absorption of light in a bulk homogeneous semiconductor produces photocarriers with non-zero momentum, it generally does not produce a current in the absence of an applied electric field because equal amounts of carriers with opposite momentum are injected. The interference of absorption processes, for example, between one-photon and two-photon absorption, can produce a current because constructive interference for carriers with one momentum can correspond to destructive interference for carriers with the opposite momentum. We show that for the interference between two-photon and three-photon absorption, the current has a narrower angular spread, i.e., a ``beam'' of electrons in a specified direction is produced in the semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Preparation and evaluation of alexandrite, forsterite, and topaz substrates for the epitaxial growth of rutile oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-insulator transitions and superconductivity in rutile-structured oxides hold promise for advanced electronic applications, yet their thin film synthesis is severely hindered by limited substrate options. Here, we present three single- crystalline substrates, BeAl2O4, Mg2SiO4, and Al2SiO4(F,OH)2, prepared via optimized thermal and chemical treatments to achieve atomically smooth surfaces suitable for epitaxial growth. Atomic force microscopy confirms atomic step-and-terrace surface morphologies, and oxide molecular-beam epitaxy growth on these substrates demonstrates successful heteroepitaxy of rutile TiO2, VO2, NbO2, and RuO2 films. Among these unconventional substrates, BeAl2O4 exhibits exceptional thermal and chemical stability, making it a versatile substrate candidate. These findings introduce new substrate platforms that facilitate strain engineering and exploration of rutile oxide thin films, potentially advancing the study of their strain-dependent physical properties.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the Hidden Symmetry in the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system. Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$ satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states. Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.</description>
