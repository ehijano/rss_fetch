      <title>Formation of bound dineutrons in the ${}^{175}Lu (n, {}^2n) {}^{174g}Lu$ nuclear reaction and its cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The dineutron as a bound chargeless nucleus of two identical nucleons has been attracting attention for many decades. In addition to the study of the formation of a bound dineutron in the outgoing channel of some specific nuclear reactions, cross section estimates have been gaining interest as research target. Purpose: The dineutron under consideration is a bound system to be formed within the potential well of heavy nucleus beyond their volume by occupying several discrete energy levels $[0 \div 0.4]$ MeV deep into the well by two neutrons in the outgoing channel of nuclear reaction when escaping from compound nucleus. Methods: We used a traditional neutron activation technique to irradiate Lu samples followed by measurements of the induced activity with HPGe spectrometer in order to detect gamma-peaks of the ${}^{175}Lu (n, 2n)^{174g}Lu$ reaction product when this reaction channel is not open for incident neutron energies. Results: Based on two measurements of the instrumental gamma ray spectra of Lu samples we reliably identified the presence of namely ${}^{174g}Lu$ isotope in the outgoing channel of the ${}^{175}Lu(n, {}^2n)^{174g}$ Lu nuclear reaction. Also, the cross section for this nuclear reaction was obtained and to be equal $33.5 \pm 5.9$ mb. Conclusions: For the first time, the dineutron as a nuclear reaction product was indirectly detected via statistically significant observation of the induced activity of ${}^{174g}Lu$ with corresponding cross-section estimate.</description>

      <title>Cross-checking the geometric effects in heavy-ion collisions at 1 GeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, the 1 GeV/nucleon deformed uranium-uranium ultra-central collisions are simulated. Based on sensitive observables, mean square collective flow and pion meson multiplicity, the impacts of high-momentum tails caused by short-range correlations and the symmetry energy in high-density regions on geometric effects are discussed under different reaction orientations. Finally, the neural network model for identifying reaction orientations is also developed.</description>

      <title>Development of wavelength-shifting PEN foils for next generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) foils have been demonstrated as a wavelength shifter suitable for operation in liquid argon. At the same time, wavelength shifting efficiency of technical grades of PEN, commercially available on the market, is lower than that of tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). This paper reports on an R&amp;D program focused on exploring the intrinsic limitations of PEN and optimizing it for the highest achievable wavelength shifting efficiency.</description>

      <title>The SNO+ Journey to 0\nu\beta\beta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SNO+ is a large multipurpose experiment with the ultimate goal of searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay in $^{130}\mathrm{Te}$. After a commissioning phase with water as the target medium, during which acquired data allowed for measurements of solar neutrinos and the detection of reactor antineutrinos, SNO+ is now filled with 780 tonnes of liquid scintillator. The higher light yield of the scintillator enhances the physics capabilities of the experiment, and a physics program including reactor, geo and solar neutrinos is currently underway. The water and unloaded scintillator phases provide crucial commissioning milestones in preparation for the tellurium loading, such as calibrating the detector and making extensive background constraint measurements as components of the final scintillator cocktail are gradually added. In a first phase, 3900~kg of natural tellurium (0.5\%) will be added to the scintillator for a predicted sensitivity of about $2\times20^{26}$ years (90\% CL) with 3 years of livetime. Higher tellurium loading will follow for predicted sensitivities above $1\times10^{27}$ years (3\% loading).</description>

      <title>Angular dependence in transverse momentum dependent diffractive parton distributions at small-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the angular dependence of the recently proposed transverse momentum dependent quark and gluon diffractive parton distributions at small-$x$. We introduce the difractive versions of the Sivers function and the elliptic gluon Wigner distribution and evaluate them in simple models with gluon saturation and study their geometric scaling properties. We also show that the diffractive version of the linearly polarized gluon distribution identically vanishes to leading order. These distributions enrich the physics opportunities for measuring semi-inclsuive diffractive DIS processes at the future electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Mass measurements in the $^{132}$Sn region with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on new precision mass measurements of neutron-rich $^{137}$Sb and $^{136-142}$I isotopes from the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer. We confirm the value from the previous Penning-trap measurement of $^{137}$Sb at the Canadian Penning Trap and therefore rule out the conflicting result from the Experimental Storage Ring. The ground state and isomer in $^{136}$I were resolved and measured directly for the first time. The isomer excitation energy, $E_x = 215.1(43)$ keV, agrees with the literature but is three times more precise. The measurements have improved the precision of the mass values and confirmed previous results in the majority of cases. However, for $^{138,140}$I the results differ by 17(6) keV and 23(12) keV, respectively. This could be explained by an unresolved contamination or different ratio of unresolved isomeric states in the case of $^{140}$I.</description>

      <title>Ambient Dose and Dose Rate Measurement in SNOLAB Underground Laboratory at Sudbury, Ontario, Canada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper describes a system and experimental procedure that use integrating passive detectors, such as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), for the measurement of ultra-low-level ambient dose equivalent rate values at the underground SNOLAB facility located in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Because these detectors are passive and can be exposed for relatively long periods of time, they can provide better sensitivity for measuring ultra-low activity levels. The final characterization of ultra-low-level ambient dose around water shielding for ongoing direct dark matter search experiments in Cube Hall at SNOLAB underground laboratory is given. The conclusion is that TLDs provide reliable results in the measurement of the ultra-low-level environmental radiation background.</description>

      <title>Elastic proton-neutron and antiproton-neutron scattering in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The total and differential cross sections of the elastic proton-neutron and antiproton-neutron scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime. Taking into account the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, which are described by the Reggeized spin-2 glueball and vector meson propagator respectively, those cross sections are obtained. It is presented that the currently available experimental data of the total cross sections can be well described within the model. Once a single adjustable parameter is determined with the total cross section data, the differential cross sections can be calculated without any additional parameters. Although the available differential cross section data are limited, it is found that our predictions are consistent with those.</description>

      <title>Scintillation characteristics of the EJ-299-02H scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A study of the dead layer thickness and quenching factor of a plastic scintillator for use in ultracold neutron (UCN) experiments is described. Alpha spectroscopy was used to determine the thickness of a thin surface dead layer, and the relative light outputs from the decay of $^{241}$Am and Compton scattering of electrons were used to extract the quenching parameter. With these characteristics of the material known, the light yield of the scintillator can be calculated. The ability to make these scintillators deuterated, accompanied by its relatively thin dead layer, make it ideal for use in UCN experiment, where the light yield of decay electrons and alphas from neutron capture are critical for counting events.</description>
