      <title>Overcoming Barriers to Computational Reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational reproducibility, the possibility for independent researchers to exactly reproduce published empirical results, is fundamental to science. Despite its importance, the proportion of research articles aiming for reproducibility remains low and uneven across disciplines. Barriers include a perceived lack of incentives for researchers and journals, practical challenges in preparing reproducible materials, and the absence of harmonised standards of reproducibility processes and requirements by journals. Existing guidance is often highly technical, reaching mainly those already engaged with reproducible research. In this paper, we first synthesize evidence on the benefits of reproducibility for both authors and journals. Drawing on our extensive experience in reproducibility checking at various journals, we then put forward concise, pragmatic guidelines for creating reproducible analyses across disciplines. We further review current reproducibility policies of selected journals, illustrating the substantial heterogeneity in requirements and procedures. Motivated by the latter, we propose conceptual foundations for a harmonised multi-tier system of reproducibility standards that could support transparent, consistent assessment across journals and research communities. Our goal as journal (reproducibility) editors and contributors to the MaRDI initiative is to encourage broader adoption of reproducibility practices, in particular by lowering practical barriers for authors and journals.</description>

      <title>Have Large Language Models Enhanced the Way Civil &amp; Environmental Engineers Write? A Quantitative Analysis of Scholarly Communication over 25 Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly emerged in civil and environmental engineering (CEE) research, education, and practice as a tool for project ideation, execution, and communication. However, it is unknown how prevalent LLM adoption is across CEE scholarship and whether it meaningfully alters research prose. Inspired by a recent analysis of biomedical abstracts, this study adapts a vocabulary-based frequency-shift methodology to estimate the incidence of LLM-written abstracts in the field of CEE scholarship using 149,452 abstracts published by the American Society of Civil Engineers from 2000 through 2025 as the representative corpus. By quantifying departures from recent vocabulary trends, we estimate 15% and 26% of abstracts published in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Prior to the introduction of LLMs in 2022, CEE publications exhibit long-term trends toward increasing numbers of authors, longer abstracts and sentences, greater use of segmenting punctuation, higher required reading levels, and a shift toward active, first-person verb constructions. Beginning around 2023, however, the frequencies of many excess style words (e.g., enhance) dramatically depart from their historic trajectories, and correspondingly, departures in multiple semantic properties are observed. When abstracts classified as likely LLM-written are isolated, these departures are shown to be largely attributable to LLM-generated text. These abstracts exhibit systematic shifts, including increased word choice diversity, more commas, increased complexity, decreased use of passive constructions, and less qualifying language commonly used to convey uncertainty, such that prose is generally more segmented, syntactically complex, and assertive. Together these findings provide the first large-scale, data-driven assessment of LLM use and effect on CEE scholarly writing.</description>

      <title>PaperX: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Academic Presentation Generation with Scholar DAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03866v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming scientific papers into multimodal presentation content is essential for research dissemination but remains labor intensive. Existing automated solutions typically treat each format as an isolated downstream task, leading to redundant processing and semantic inconsistency. We introduce PaperX, a unified framework that models academic presentation generation as a structural transformation and rendering process. Central to our approach is the Scholar DAG, an intermediate representation that decouples the paper's logical structure from its final presentation syntax. By applying adaptive graph traversal strategies, PaperX generates diverse, high quality outputs from a single source. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves the state of the art performance in content fidelity and aesthetic quality while significantly improving cost efficiency compared to specialized single task agents.</description>

      <title>Evolving scientific collaboration among EU member states, candidate countries and global partners: 2000-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how EU integration, globalisation, and geopolitical disruptions have influenced scientific collaboration among European countries at different stages of EU membership. Specifically, it distinguishes between the EU-14, the EU-13, that joined the EU in 2004 or later, and EU candidate countries. Using Scopus article, the study analyses Relative Intensity of Collaboration (RIC) among EU member state, candidate countries and China, Latin America, the UK, the USA and Russia. Findings indicate increasing integration within European groups and with global partners, yet persistent hierarchical structures remain. EU-14 countries form the core of the network, exhibiting stable and cohesive collaboration, including with the UK despite Brexit. EU-13 countries occupy an intermediate position, showing moderate collaboration with EU-14 but stronger collaboration within their own group, with EU candidate countries and Russia. EU candidate countries demonstrate even weaker integration with EU-14, focusing on intra-group ties and links with EU-13 and Russia. RIC peaks in 2012 and 2018 for EU-13 and EU candidate countries correspond to Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe cycles, highlighting the role of EU Framework Programmes. Collaboration with Russia increased following 2014 and only marginally declined after 2022. For EU-14, it exceeds collaboration with the USA. Collaboration with China remains limited due to network and cultural constraints, with similar intensity across all three groups. Overall, funding and policy initiatives are critical for stable international collaboration.</description>
