      <title>Optimizing information transmission in neural induction constrains cell surface contacts of ascidian embryos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The onset of neural induction in the anterior ectoderm of ascidian embryos is regulated at the extracellular level by FGF signaling molecules, which control the acquisition of neural fate through the activation of the ERK pathway. Among the anterior ectoderm cells exposed to FGF, only a fraction will acquire neural fate. The selection of neural precursors depends on the quasi-invariant geometry of the embryo, which imposes upon each ectoderm cell a precise area of cell surface contact with underlying FGF-expressing (mesendoderm) cells. Here, we investigate information transmission between FGF and activated ERK and how this depends on the geometry of the system. Optimizing information transmission with the constraint that the total FGF-emitting surface area is restricted, as in the embryo, we find that the surface contacts with FGF that maximize information transmission are close to those observed experimentally. This information optimal solution is compatible with the anterior ectoderm cells having different areas of cell surface exposure to FGF, allowing the embryo to use cell surface areas as a regulatory mechanism for differentiating the outcome of cells that sense a constant FGF concentration.</description>

      <title>Considerations and recommendations from the ISMRM Diffusion Study Group for preclinical diffusion MRI: Part 2 -- Ex vivo imaging: added value and acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The value of preclinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) is substantial. While dMRI enables in vivo non-invasive characterization of tissue, ex vivo dMRI is increasingly used to probe tissue microstructure and brain connectivity. Ex vivo dMRI has several experimental advantages including higher signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution compared to in vivo studies, and enabling more advanced diffusion contrasts. Another major advantage of ex vivo dMRI is the direct comparison with histological data as a methodological validation. However, there are a number of considerations that must be made when performing ex vivo experiments. The steps from tissue preparation, image acquisition and processing, and interpretation of results are complex, with decisions that not only differ dramatically from in vivo imaging of small animals, but ultimately affect what questions can be answered using the data. This work represents "Part 2" of a 3-part series of recommendations and considerations for preclinical dMRI. We describe best practices for dMRI of ex vivo tissue, with a focus on the value that ex vivo imaging adds to the field of dMRI and considerations in ex vivo image acquisition. We give general considerations and foundational knowledge that must be considered when designing experiments. We describe differences in specimens and models and discuss why some may be more or less appropriate for different studies. We then give guidelines for ex vivo protocols, including tissue fixation, sample preparation, and MR scanning. In each section, we attempt to provide guidelines and recommendations, but also highlight areas for which no guidelines exist (and why), and where future work should lie. An overarching goal herein is to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of ex vivo dMRI acquisitions and analyses, and thereby advance biomedical knowledge.</description>
