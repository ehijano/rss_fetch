      <title>Picometer Sensitive Prototype of the Optical Truss Interferometer for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical truss interferometer (OTI) is a contingent subsystem proposed for the LISA telescopes to aid in the verification of a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ optical path length stability. Each telescope would be equipped with three pairs of compact fiber-coupled units, each forming an optical cavity with a baseline proportional to the telescope length at different points around the aperture. Employing a Pound-Drever-Hall approach to maintain a modulated laser field on resonance with each cavity, the dimensional stability of the telescope can be measured and verified. We have designed and developed prototype OTI units to demonstrate the capability of measuring stable structures, such as the LISA telescope, with a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ sensitivity using a set of freely mountable fiber-injected cavities. Aside from its initial motivation for the telescope, the OTI can also be readily integrated with other systems to aid in ground testing experiments. In this paper, we outline our experimental setup, measurement results, and analyses of the noise limitations.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic effects in rod-like metal-dielectric nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of rod-like two-layer nanoparticles are studied using the notions of equivalent prolate spheroid. The calculations are presented for frequency dependencies for polarizability and the absorption and scattering cross-section of prolate spheroids, cylinders, and spherocylinders. The effect of the sizes, the shapes of the nanoparticle and the material of the core and the shell on the location of the maxima of the imaginary part of polarizability and absorption and scattering cross-sections is analysed. The recommendations regarding the shape and size ratio of the nanoparticles for obtaining the maximum value of radiation efficiency are formulated.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Fabrication of InGaP-on-Insulator for Nonlinear and Quantum Photonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of manufacturable and scalable integrated nonlinear photonic materials is driving key technologies in diverse areas such as high-speed communications, signal processing, sensing, and quantum information. Here, we demonstrate a novel nonlinear platform -- InGaP-on-insulator -- optimized for visible-to-telecommunication wavelength $\chi^{\left(2\right)}$ nonlinear optical processes. In this work, we detail our 100-mm wafer-scale InGaP-on-insulator fabrication process realized via wafer bonding, optical lithography, and dry-etching techniques. The resulting wafers yield 1000s of components in each fabrication cycle, with initial designs that include chip-to-fiber couplers, 12.5-cm-long nested spiral waveguides, and arrays of microring resonators with free-spectral ranges spanning 400-900 GHz. We demonstrate intrinsic resonator quality factors as high as 324,000 (440,000) for single-resonance (split-resonance) modes near 1550 nm corresponding to 1.56 dB cm$^{-1}$ (1.22 dB cm$^{-1}$) propagation loss. We analyze the loss versus waveguide width and resonator radius to establish the operating regime for optimal 775-to-1550 nm phase matching. By combining the high $\chi^{\left(2\right)}$ and $\chi^{\left(3\right)}$ optical nonlinearity of InGaP with wafer-scale fabrication and low propagation loss, these results open promising possibilities for entangled-photon, multi-photon, and squeezed light generation.</description>

      <title>Topological winding guaranteed coherent orthogonal scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control has enabled various novel phenomena in wave scattering. We introduce an effect called coherent orthogonal scattering, where the output wave becomes orthogonal to the reference output state without scatterers. This effect leads to a unity extinction coefficient and complete mode conversion. We examine the conditions for this effect and reveal its topological nature by relating it to the indivisibility between the dimension and the winding number of scattering submatrices. These findings deepen our understanding of topological scattering phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our research, we have developed a novel mechanism that allows for a significant reduction in the smallest sampling unit of digital image sensors (DIS) to as small as 1/16th of a pixel, through measuring the intra-pixel quantum efficiency for the first time and recomputing the image. Employing our method, the physical sampling resolution of DIS can be enhanced by 16 times. The method has undergone rigorous testing in real-world imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued scatter compensation in nonlinear microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear, i.e., multi-photon microscopy is a powerful technique for imaging deep into biological tissues. Its penetration depth can be increased further using adaptive optics. In this work, we present a fast, feedback-based adaptive-optics algorithm, termed C-DASH, for multi-photon imaging through multiply-scattering media. C-DASH utilises complex-valued light shaping (i.e., joint shaping of amplitude and phase), which offers several advantages over phase-only techniques: it converges faster, it delivers higher image quality enhancement, it shows a robust performance largely insensitive to the axial position of the correction plane, and it has a higher ability to cope with, on the one hand, scattering media that vary over time and, on the other hand, scattering media that are partially absorbing. Furthermore, our method is practically self-aligning. We also present a simple way to implement C-DASH using a single reflection off a phase-only spatial light modulator. We provide a thorough characterisation of our method, presenting results of numerical simulations as well as two-photon excited fluorescence imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution imaging using super-oscillatory diffractive neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical super-oscillation enables far-field super-resolution imaging beyond diffraction limits. However, the existing super-oscillatory lens for the spatial super-resolution imaging system still confronts critical limitations in performance due to the lack of a more advanced design method and the limited design degree of freedom. Here, we propose an optical super-oscillatory diffractive neural network, i.e., SODNN, that can achieve super-resolved spatial resolution for imaging beyond the diffraction limit with superior performance over existing methods. SODNN is constructed by utilizing diffractive layers to implement optical interconnections and imaging samples or biological sensors to implement nonlinearity, which modulates the incident optical field to create optical super-oscillation effects in 3D space and generate the super-resolved focal spots. By optimizing diffractive layers with 3D optical field constraints under an incident wavelength size of $\lambda$, we achieved a super-oscillatory spot with a full width at half maximum of 0.407$\lambda$ in the far field distance over 400$\lambda$ without side-lobes over the field of view, having a long depth of field over 10$\lambda$. Furthermore, the SODNN implements a multi-wavelength and multi-focus spot array that effectively avoids chromatic aberrations. Our research work will inspire the development of intelligent optical instruments to facilitate the applications of imaging, sensing, perception, etc.</description>

      <title>Stark Control of Plexcitonic States in Incoherent Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic control of quantum dots embedded in the plasmonic nanocavities enables active tuning of photonic devices for emerging applications in Quantum optics such as quantum information processing, entanglement and ultrafast optical switching. Here, we demonstrate the coherent control of plexcitonic states in (i) an off-resonant and (ii) a resonant coupled quantum systems through optical Stark effect (OSE). We analyze a hybrid plasmon-emitter system which exhibits tunable Fano resonance, Stark induced transparency (SIT) and vacuum Rabi splitting due to quadratic Stark shift in the degenerate states of quantum emitter (QE). In addition, a resonantly coupled system shows the signature of double Fano resonance due to Stark-induced splitting in a two-level QE. Our study shows that Stark tuning of plexcitons not only mitigates decoherence in the quantum system but it also stimulates on/off switching of spontaneous photon emission in the visible regime. Such tunable systems can be used to operate photonic integrated circuits (PIC) for applications in quantum computing and information processing.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled Brillouin scattering in elliptical optophononic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast-growing development of optomechanical applications has motivated advancements in Brillouin scattering research. In particular, the study of high frequency acoustic phonons at the nanoscale is interesting due to large range of interactions with other excitations in matter. However, standard Brillouin spectroscopy schemes rely on fixed wavelength filtering, which limits the usefulness for the study of tunable optophononic resonators. It has been recently demonstrated that elliptical optophononic micropillar resonators induce different energy-dependent polarization states for the Brillouin and the elastic Rayleigh scattering, and that a polarization filtering setup could be implemented to increase the contrast between the inelastic and elastic scattering of the light. An optimal filtering configuration can be reached when the polarization states of the laser and the Brillouin signal are orthogonal from each other. In this work, we theoretically investigate the parameters of such polarization-based filtering technique to enhance the efficiency of Brillouin scattering detection. For the filtering optimization, we explore the initial wavelength and polarization state of the incident laser, as well as in the ellipticity of the micropillars, and reach an almost optimal configuration for nearly background-free Brillouin detection. Our findings are one step forward on the efficient detection of Brillouin scattering in nanostructures for potential applications in fields such as optomechanics and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Integrated Triply Resonant Electro-Optic Frequency Comb in Lithium Tantalate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated frequency comb generators based on Kerr parametric oscillation have led to chip-scale, gigahertz-spaced combs with new applications spanning hyperscale telecommunications, low-noise microwave synthesis, LiDAR, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. Recent progress in lithium niobate (LN) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has resulted in chip-scale electro-optic (EO) frequency combs, offering precise comb-line positioning and simple operation without relying on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. However, current integrated EO combs face limited spectral coverage due to the large microwave power required to drive the non-resonant capacitive electrodes and the strong intrinsic birefringence of Lithium Niobate. Here, we overcome both challenges with an integrated triply resonant architecture, combining monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) with PICs based on the recently emerged thin-film lithium tantalate. With resonantly enhanced EO interaction and reduced birefringence in Lithium Tantalate, we achieve a four-fold comb span extension and a 16-fold power reduction compared to the conventional non-resonant microwave design. Driven by a hybrid-integrated laser diode, the comb spans over 450nm (60THz) with &gt;2000 lines, and the generator fits within a compact 1cm^2 footprint. We additionally observe that the strong EO coupling leads to an increased comb existence range approaching the full free spectral range of the optical microresonator. The ultra-broadband comb generator, combined with detuning-agnostic operation, could advance chip-scale spectrometry and ultra-low-noise millimeter wave synthesis and unlock octave-spanning EO combs. The methodology of co-designing microwave and optical resonators can be extended to a wide range of integrated electro-optics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ultrafast dynamics initiated by a coherent superposition of core-excited states of nitrous oxide molecule. Using high-level \textit{ab-initio} methods, we show that the decoherence caused by the electronic decay and the nuclear dynamics is substantially slower than the induced ultrafast quantum beatings, allowing the system to undergo several oscillations before it dephases. We propose a proof-of-concept experiment using the harmonic up-conversion scheme available at X-ray free-electron laser facilities to trace the evolution of the created core-excited-state coherence through a time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: The primary and metastatic stages of BC consider different cancerous cell lines (MDAs), meaning the highest number of cells in this research (300,000) represents the metastatic stages of BC, and 50,000 represents the primary level of BC developments have been studied based on fluorescence-enhanced photodynamic characterizations. The ability to characterize the fluorescence caused by MDA with 50,000 cells compared to the dominant radiation of MDA with 300,000 cells is emphatic proof of the high potential of fluorescence technique in timely BC detections. 5-ALA induces an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) photosensitizer through a biosynthetic pathway, leading to red radiation of fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence signal reduction due to decreased cell viability and increased MDA's cellular death rate corresponds to the changes in lipid metabolism enzymes of MDAs cultured at different doses. Furthermore, statistical concerns have been studied using PCA multivariate component analysis to differentiate MDA cells administrated by 5-ALA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ultrastrong driving of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O by a microwave field. The effect of the microwaves was studied using optical absorption specstroscopy, and via the observation of sidebands on the transmitted laser light. A model based on Floquet theory was constructed to explore the system beyond the rotating wave approximation. We obtain near quantitative agreement between theory and experiment across a 16-fold range of microwave field strength, from $43.5\pm 0.3$ V m$^{-1}$ up to $688 \pm 5$ V m$^{-1}$, crossing from the perturbative to the ultrastrong driving regime. Compared to Rydberg atoms, the large non-radiative width of Rydberg exctions leads to new behaviour such as the emergence of an absoprtion continuum without ionization.</description>

      <title>Dawn of a nuclear clock: frequency ratio of the $^{229m}$Th isomeric transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic dipole polarizability and plasmon resonances of multilayer nanoshells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalized formula for calculating the dipole polarizability of spherical multilayer nanoshells (MNSs) within the long-wavelength approximation (LWA). Given a MNS with a finite number of concentric layers, radii, and dielectric properties, embedded in a dielectric medium, in the presence of a uniform electric field, we show that its frequency-dependent and complex dipole polarizability can be expressed in terms of the dipole polarizability of the preceding MNS. This approach is different from previous more involved methods where the LWA polarizability of a MNS is usually derived from scattering coefficients. Using both finite-element method- and Mie theory-based simulations, we show that our proposed formula reproduces the usual LWA results, when it is used to predict absorption spectra, by comparing the results to simulated spectra obtained from MNSs with $n$ number of layers up to $n = 6$ layers. An iterative algorithm for calculating the dipole polarizability of a MNS based on the generalized formula is presented. A Fr\"{o}hlich function whose zeroes correspond to the dipolar localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) supported by the MNS is proposed. We identify a pairing behaviour by some LSPRs in the Fr\"{o}hlich function that might also be useful for mode characterization.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Orientations of and Separation between an Overlapping Pair of Dipole Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that it is impossible to distinguish two spatially overlapping fluorescent molecules from a single rotating molecule, even if one modulates the polarization of pumping light or the detection dipole-spread function (DSF). If the target is known to be a dipole pair, existing imaging methods perform poorly for measuring their angular separation. We propose simultaneously modulating the excitation polarization and DSF, which demonstrates robust discrimination between dipole pairs versus single molecules. Our method improves the precision of measuring centroid orientation by 50% and angular separation by 4- to 6-fold over existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Microparticle-assisted 2D super resolution virtual image modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approach that makes it possible to explain the phenomenon of super resolution in a virtual image using dielectric microparticles is presented. A resolution of the order of 50 nm in the visible range is demonstrated. The presented two-dimensional model uses the FDTD code to generate radiation and its propagation through a microparticle-object system and the following optical image generation using backward propagation technique.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Optimization of Metasurfaces for Imaging with Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the end-to-end optimization of metasurface imaging systems that reconstruct targets using compressed sensing, a technique for solving underdetermined imaging problems when the target object exhibits sparsity (i.e. the object can be described by a small number of non-zero values, but the positions of these values are unknown). We nest an iterative, unapproximated compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm into our end-to-end optimization pipeline, resulting in an interpretable, data-efficient method for maximally leveraging metaoptics to exploit object sparsity. We apply our framework to super-resolution imaging and high-resolution depth imaging with a phase-change material. In both situations, our end-to-end framework computationally discovers optimal metasurface structures for compressed sensing recovery, automatically balancing a number of complicated design considerations to select an imaging measurement matrix from a complex, physically constrained manifold with millions ofdimensions. The optimized metasurface imaging systems are robust to noise, significantly improving over random scattering surfaces and approaching the ideal compressed sensing performance of a Gaussian matrix, showing how a physical metasurface system can demonstrably approach the mathematical limits of compressed sensing.</description>
