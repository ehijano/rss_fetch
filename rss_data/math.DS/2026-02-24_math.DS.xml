      <title>Functorial invariants for chaos topology from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The templex is a recently introduced topological object bridging homologies and templates for chaotic attractors: its cell complex encodes the directionless properties of the attractor's branched manifold in phase space, and its directed graph captures the flow-compatible paths starting and ending in joining loci. Algebraic topology is deeply connected to category theory because it studies spaces by translating them into algebraic objects through structure-preserving mappings. The homology functor translates structural properties into a set of layered invariants called homology groups. The templex is shown here to play the same role for directed spaces that cell complexes play for spaces. The directed properties of a templex are found therewith to admit a functorial formulation. This formulation provides a rigorous foundation for a theory of chaos topology developed so far algorithmically, and establishes operationally a topological criterion for finite-time chaos. A climatic simulation and an experimental speech signal are analyzed as illustrative applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Invariants from Asymptotic Composants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic composants and their incidence relations are powerful invariants of 1-dimensional inflation tilings spaces, which can distinguish many MLD classes of tilings. In particular, and unlike most other invariants, they can often provide obstructions to a tiling space being MLD to its reflection. We present a simple algorithm to determine these asymptotic composants for primitive inflation tiling spaces in one dimension, and illustrate how they can be used to tell different MLD classes of tilings apart. In an Appendix, we then show that the structure of asymptotic composants, together with the orbit separation dimension (OSD), can distinguish all MLD classes of inflations tilings with pure-point spectrum for a bunch of small inflation factors, which illustrates the power of these invariants.</description>

      <title>Global Attractors for Dissipative Flows on Degenerate Constraint Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of dissipative dynamical systems evolving on smooth constraint hypersurfaces endowed with degenerate induced bilinear forms is studied. The intrinsic evolution is generated by constraint--preserving vector fields on manifolds whose tangent bundles admit a nontrivial null distribution associated with the degeneracy of the induced structure. In this indefinite setting, the absence of coercive Lyapunov functionals prevents the direct application of classical attractor theory developed for Riemannian phase spaces. Dissipation is instead characterized relative to functionals that are compatible with the null distribution and exhibit decay exclusively in directions transverse to the associated foliation. Under suitable involutivity and regularity assumptions on the null distribution, all bounded trajectories are shown to be asymptotically confined to invariant leaves of the corresponding foliation. Asymptotic compactness of the intrinsic evolution is then established without coercivity by reducing the dynamics to a projected semiflow on the quotient manifold determined by the characteristic distribution. In the presence of a bounded absorbing set and continuous semiflow structure, the intrinsic evolution admits a compact global attractor saturated by the null leaves, whose effective asymptotic dynamics are governed by a compact invariant subset of the reduced phase space. Furthermore, when the compatible functional satisfies a Morse--type nondegeneracy condition in directions transverse to the null distribution and the induced transversal linearization admits no center spectrum, the projected semiflow possesses no neutral directions. The resulting framework provides a mechanism by which constraint--induced degeneracy enforces effective dimensional reduction in dissipative geometric evolution systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the polynomial entropy of homeomorphisms on regular curves is bounded above by one. Moreover, the polynomial entropy equals one under the fairly mild condition that the homeomorphism possesses a wandering point. We obtain a rigidity result for homeomorphisms on local dendrites (and therefore on graphs and dendrites): their polynomial entropy is either zero or one.</description>

      <title>Slow-fast dynamics in a planar parasite--host model with an extinction singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a slow-fast parasite--host model featuring a singularity at the extinction state. Using techniques from Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT), and in particular the so-called blow-up method, we desingularize that point and reconstruct the local and global dynamics. The system we consider is in non-standard GSPT form and is characterized by a rich dynamical behavior: families of slow-fast homoclinic orbits, canard-like transitions generated by trajectories that remain close to a repelling critical manifold, and topological changes produced by infinitesimal variations of the infection rate, including the creation and destruction of an endemic equilibrium. We conclude with a numerical exploration of the model, to illustrate our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Subdiagrams and invariant measures for generalized Bratteli diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of this paper contribute to the study of invariant measures of Borel dynamical systems that can be modeled using generalized Bratteli diagrams. In this context, we study tail invariant measures on the path spaces of generalized Bratteli diagrams, allowing countably infinite vertex sets at each level. Our main focus is on subdiagrams of generalized Bratteli diagrams and the problem of extending tail invariant probability measures from vertex and edge subdiagrams to the ambient diagram. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the finiteness of such extensions, formulated in terms of incidence matrices and associated stochastic matrices. Several classes of generalized Bratteli diagrams and their subdiagrams are analyzed in detail, including simple, stationary, and bounded size diagrams. We develop constructive, step-by-step procedures for measure extension and for approximating invariant measures by measures supported on suitable subdiagrams. In addition, we provide explicit examples of generalized Bratteli diagrams that admit no probability tail invariant measures, a phenomenon absent for standard Bratteli diagrams with finite vertex sets. Finally, we address convergence questions for sequences of invariant measures arising from approximations by subdiagrams, clarifying the relationship between combinatorial structure and measure-theoretic behavior.</description>

      <title>Certified spectral approximation of transfer operators and the Gauss map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the full spectral picture of a transfer operator (every isolated eigenvalue, eigenvector, and Riesz projector outside the essential spectral radius) can be approximated to arbitrary precision by finite-rank discretizations, with no spectral pollution. The method is a~posteriori: once a computable approximation bound is available (from compactness or a Doeblin--Fortet--Lasota--Yorke inequality, which may require hyperbolicity constants and adapted Banach spaces), the spectral gap and multiplicity are certified from computed data via a resolvent perturbation bound, with no further dynamical input. This applies both to compact operators on a single Banach space and to quasi-compact operators satisfying a Doeblin--Fortet--Lasota--Yorke inequality, extending Li's resolution of the Ulam conjecture from the invariant density to the entire discrete spectrum with certified error bounds at every finite truncation.
  As a benchmark, we certify the first $50$ nonzero eigenvalues of the Gauss--Kuzmin--Wirsing operator to at least $90$ rigorous decimal digits, together with their eigenvectors, Riesz projectors, and spectral gap, yielding a certified spectral expansion for Gauss--Kuzmin distributions with explicit error bounds and providing a rigorous answer to the Gauss--Babenko--Knuth problem on the spectral data of the Gauss map.</description>

      <title>Existence of periodic measure-valued solutions to the nonlocal continuity equation via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of periodic solutions for a class of nonlocal continuity equations, which include mean-field equations derived from systems of coupled oscillators. While periodic solutions at the particle level have been studied through the construction of a Poincar\'e map on a section of an invariant set, extending this analysis to the level of continuity equations presents nontrivial challenges. In particular, setting an appropriate topology for the infinite-dimensional space to show invariance and apply the fixed point argument is not easy. To overcome this difficulty, we use fixed point theorem for geodesically convex spaces constructed by optimal transportation. Specifically, from the disintegration with respect to stationary variable, we define a metric using the Wasserstein-$2$ distance over one-dimensional space, which yields a $CAT(0)$ space. In this topology, we construct an invariance set of probability measures and prove the existence of the periodic measure-valued solution from Schauder's fixed point theorem on geodesically convex spaces. As a corollary, our method directly gives an existence of periodic graph measure solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part deals with piecewise fractional linear maps with three branches. Given a map $T$ a map $S$ is called a related map if some branches of $T$ are replaced by a 'flipped' branch, namely a branch of $1-T$. The main question is if $T$ and $S$ have a common invariant measure. The short second part presents invariant measures of a new type.</description>

      <title>On Lebesgue measure preserving Besicovitch functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the space $C_{\lambda}$ of all continuous interval maps preserving the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$. A continuous function $f\colon~[0,1]\to \mathbb R$ is called Besicovitch if it does not have any finite or infinite unilateral derivative. It is known that the set of Besicovitch functions in $C_{\lambda}$ is nonempty and meager. We prove that no Besicovitch function is invertible $\lambda$-almost everywhere. As a consequence, every Besicovitch function in $C_{\lambda}$ has positive measure-theoretic entropy with respect to $\lambda$. Furthermore, we show that Besicovitch functions are dense in $C_{\lambda}$ and, consequently, also dense in the class of interval maps with a dense set of periodic points.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Data-Driven Dynamical Models via Inverse Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven model identification strategies can be used to obtain phenomenological models that capture the temporal evolution of observable data. While it is usually straightforward to obtain such a model from time series data, for instance with least-squares fitting, it is generally difficult to quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction of the temporal evolution of the observables. This paper considers a general framework for uncertainty quantification in data-driven dynamical models by framing prediction error through the lens of inverse problem theory. Building on Koopman-inspired model identification strategies that are suited for nonlinear dynamical models, we consider a prediction as an approximate measurement from which the original input state can be faithfully recovered, and define the prediction error as the MSE of solving the inverse problem that would yield this prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on both numerical models and experimental data showing that it provides a robust uncertainty measure of model performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider traveling wave solutions of a one-dimensional model for detonation waves derived by Rosales and Majda, when the reaction order $\alpha$ belongs to $[0,1)$. The chemical kinetics is a simplified Arrhenius law or a Heaviside function. The model in the reaction zone is a slow-fast dynamical system for a vector representing temperature and mass fraction, which depends on the velocity $c$ and small viscosity $\beta$. Our goal in this paper is to study the bifurcation diagram in the $(\beta,c)$ parameter space and identify the nature of the trajectories corresponding to viscous shock waves. The demonstrations are based on a variety of techniques including the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem and the Fenichel theory. Theoretical results are confirmed by numerical computations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers have developed hybrid Van der Pol Rayleigh Duffing type oscillators to model human induced forces; however, their analytical framework has largely relied on the Lindstedt Poincare perturbation method, energy balance approaches, and harmonic balance techniques. This paper aims to apply new mathematical tools to these existing models and address potential research gaps. An analytical proof for the stability of the limit cycle has been formulated by using the Krylov Bogolyubov perturbation method. The multiple scales method has been modified to highlight an iterative algorithm for determining the order of approximation required to capture nonlinear effects. The describing function method is utilised to formulate an alternate amplitude. Comparisons between first order amplitudes obtained from perturbation analysis and the describing function formulations reveal conditions under which the two approaches converge. These conditions are exploited to formulate additional constraints for the estimation of model parameters, offering a systematic alternative to purely optimisation based approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a consensus based optimization algorithm with average drift (in short Ad-CBO) and provide a theoretical framework for it. In the theoretical analysis, we show that particle solutions to Ad-CBO converge to a global minimizer. In numerical simulations, we examine Ad-CBO's performance in optimizing static and dynamic objective functions. As a real-time application, we test the efficiency of Ad-CBO to find the optimal portfolio given stochastically evolving multi-asset prices in a financial market. The proposed Ad-CBO exhibits higher searching speed, lower tracking errors and regret bound than the CBO without stochastic diffusion</description>

      <title>Linear Reservoir: A Diagonalization-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a diagonalization-based optimization for Linear Echo State Networks (ESNs) that reduces the per-step computational complexity of reservoir state updates from O(N^2) to O(N). By reformulating reservoir dynamics in the eigenbasis of the recurrent matrix, the recurrent update becomes a set of independent element-wise operations, eliminating the matrix multiplication. We further propose three methods to use our optimization depending on the situation: (i) Eigenbasis Weight Transformation (EWT), which preserves the dynamics of standard and trained Linear ESNs, (ii) End-to-End Eigenbasis Training (EET), which directly optimizes readout weights in the transformed space and (iii) Direct Parameter Generation (DPG), that bypasses matrix diagonalization by directly sampling eigenvalues and eigenvectors, achieving comparable performance than standard Linear ESNs. Across all experiments, both our methods preserve predictive accuracy while offering significant computational speedups, making them a replacement of standard Linear ESNs computations and training, and suggesting a shift of paradigm in linear ESN towards the direct selection of eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Hilbert surfaces, modular forms, and Siegel-Veech constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the values of the Siegel-Veech constants associated with saddle connections having distinct endpoints on translation surfaces in Prym eigenform loci in $\Omega \mathcal{M}_3(2,2)^{\rm odd}$. In particular, we show that these constants are actually the same for all of these loci. As a by-product, we show that the Euler characteristic of the Hilbert modular surfaces which parametrize Abelian surfaces with $(1,2)$-polarization admitting a real multiplication and the Euler characteristic of their product locus are related by a simple formula. For principally polarized Abelian surfaces, a similar phenomenon has been observed by Bainbridge.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any closed surface $S$ there is an explict neighborhood $V$ of the fuchsian locus in quasifuchsian space $\mathsf{QF}(S)$ such that for every representation $\rho\in V$ which is not fuchsian, there is a proper affine action on $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ with linear part $\mathsf{Ad}(\rho)$. We further show that there is a larger neighborhood $U$ of the Fuchsian locus so that every critical point of the entropy function in $U$ lies on the Fuchsian locus.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate near-parabolic renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invariant classes under parabolic and near-parabolic renormalization have proved extremely useful for studying the dynamics of polynomials. The first such class was introduced by Inou-Shishikura to study quadratic polynomials; their argument has been extended to the unicritical cubic case by Yang and the general unicritical case by Ch\'eritat. However, all of these classes are only applicable to maps which have a fixed point with multiplier close to one, though it is well-known that similar phenomena occur when the multiplier is close to any root of unity. In this paper we define the parabolic and near-parabolic renormalization operators in the general setting and construct invariant classes. In the general setting we can observe a new phenomenon: the multiplier may be close to several roots unity. In this case, we show how to directly relate the different near-parabolic renormalizations that arise.</description>

      <title>Relation between irrationality and regularity for $ C^1 $ conjugacy of $ C^2 $ circle diffeomorphisms to rigid rotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing the modulus of continuity, we first establish the corresponding cross-ratio distortion estimates under $ C^2 $ smoothness, and further derive a Denjoy-type inequality, which is almost optimal for dealing with circle diffeomorphisms. The latter plays a prominent role in the study of $ C^1 $ conjugacy to irrational rotations. We also establish an explicit integrability correlation between continuity and irrationality for the first time. Furthermore, the regularity of the conjugation is addressed and proved to be sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a framework for turning a numerical simulation of a gap soliton in the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation into a rigorous mathematical proof of its existence. These nonlinear localized solutions play a central role in the study of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We reformulate the problem of proving their existence as the search for homoclinic orbits in a dynamical system. We then apply computer-assisted proof techniques to obtain verifiable conditions under which a numerically approximated trajectory corresponds to a true homoclinic orbit. This work also presents the first examples of computer-assisted proofs of gap solitons in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on non-perturbative parameter regimes.</description>

Abstract: It is known that Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms have the shadowing property; however, the question of whether $C(f)$ also has the shadowing property when $f$ is Morse-Smale remains open and has been resolved only in a few specific cases~\cite{AB}. We prove that if $f:M\to M$ is a time-one-map of Morse gradient flow, the induced map $C(f):C(M)\to C(M)$ on the hyperspace of subcontinua does not have the shadowing property.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the polynomial entropy of the induced map $F_n(f)$ on the $n$-fold symmetric product of a compact space $X$ and its suspension are both equal to $nh_{pol}(f)$, when $f:X\to X$ is a homeomorphism with a finite chain recurrent set $\mathcal{CR}(f)$. We also give a lower bound for the polynomial entropy on the suspension, for a homeomorphism $f$ with at least one wandering point, under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of stationary measures and the Lyapunov Landscape for families random dynamical systems with smooth additive noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient and validated method for approximating the stationary measures of random dynamical systems with smooth additive noise. The approach leverages the strong regularizing properties of the associated transfer operator through a finite-dimensional reduction based on Fourier approximation. Explicit error bounds make the method suitable for use in computer-assisted proofs and rigorous numerical investigations; in particular, its efficiency {\em enables systematic explorations of parameter space}.
  The method provides access to the stationary measure and supports the analysis of key statistical properties of the system. As an application, we study noise-induced phenomena, focusing on the transition from positive to negative Lyapunov exponent (commonly known as Noise Induced Order) in families of random unimodal maps with Gaussian additive noise.
  By analyzing the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the system parameters, we identify transitions along a hypersurface in parameter space. The parameters we consider include the standard deviation (intensity) of the Gaussian noise and the shape of the unimodal map.</description>

      <title>Khintchine dichotomy and Schmidt estimates for self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the classical theorems of Khintchine and Schmidt in metric Diophantine approximation to the context of self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. For this, we establish effective equidistribution of associated random walks on $\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{Z})$. This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough.
  Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence. Along the way, we also establish non-concentration properties of self-similar measures near algebraic subvarieties of $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of double base expansions and binary shifts with a hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two real bases $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, a binary sequence $i_1 i_2 \cdots \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is the $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion of the number \[ \pi_{q_0,q_1}(i_1 i_2 \cdots) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i_k}{q_{i_1} \cdots q_{i_k}}. \] Let $U_{q_0,q_1}$ be the set of all real numbers having a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion. When the bases are equal, i.e., $q_0 = q_1 = q$, Allaart and Kong (2019) established the continuity in $q$ of the Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set $U_{q,q}$, building on the work of Komornik, Kong, and Li (2017). We derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of $U_{q_0,q_1}$ and the entropy of the underlying subshift for arbitrary $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, and prove the continuity of these quantities as functions of $(q_0, q_1)$. Our results also concern general dynamical systems described by binary shifts with a hole, including, in particular, the doubling map with a hole and (linear) Lorenz maps.</description>

Abstract: We study systematically cross sections of probability preserving actions of unimodular groups and their associated transverse measures, and introduce the invariant \emph{intersection covolume} to quantify their periodicity. Our main theorem, derived from a higher order version of Kac's lemma, shows that the intersection covolume is bounded below by the intensity, with equality precisely when the action is induced by a lattice (in the sense of Mackey). We further prove that the natural cross sections of cut--and--project actions have finite intersection covolume.</description>

      <title>A dynamical algorithm to compute hyperbolic Julia sets in polynomial time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperbolic Julia sets of complex polynomials are known to be computable in polynomial time due to pioneering work of Braverman in 2005 (10.1016/j.entcs.2004.06.031). In this paper, we present an alternative method for establishing poly-time computability of hyperbolic Julia sets, which allows us to establish, via a new algorithm, lower computability of the hyperbolicity locus of polynomials of a fixed degree. We first adapt our recently developed algorithms for the computability of polynomial skew products (preprint available arXiv.2508.08033) and then apply a refinement that allows us to establish poly-time computation of hyperbolic Julia sets. Finally, we derive lower computability of the hyperbolicity locus via an adapted lattice/refinement search algorithm. In contrast to Braverman's 2005 algorithm/proof, our approach is dynamical in nature and does not rely on techniques unique to complex analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper new numerical invariants of structurally unstable vector fields in the plane are found. One of the main tools is an improved asymptotics of sparkling saddle connections that occur when a separatrix loop of a hyperbolic saddle breaks. Another main tool is a new topological invariant of two arithmetic progressions, both perturbed and unperturbed, on the real line. For the pairs of the unperturbed arithmetic progressions we give a complete topological classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epidemic models play a crucial role in population dynamics, offering valuable insights into disease transmission while aiding in epidemic prediction and control. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical model of the time-fractional Zika virus transmission for human and mosquito populations. The fractional derivative is considered in the Caputo sense of order $\alpha\in(0,1).$ We begin by conducting a qualitative analysis using the stability theory of differential equations. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are established, and the model's stability is examined through Hyers-Ulam stability analysis. Furthermore, an efficient difference scheme utilizing the standard L1 technique is developed to simulate the model and analyze the solution's behavior under key parameters. The resulting nonlinear algebraic system is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings. Graphical results indicate that the fractional model provides deeper insights and a better understanding of disease dynamics. These findings aid in controlling the virus through contact precautions and recommended therapies while also helping to predict its future spread.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical kinetic framework to investigate interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, focusing on the spatial dynamics of tumor progression and immune responses. We develop two kinetic models: one describes a conservative scenario where immune cells switch between active and passive states without proliferation, while the other incorporates immune cell proliferation and apoptosis. By considering specific assumptions about the microscopic processes, we derive macroscopic systems featuring linear diffusion, nonlinear cross-diffusion, and nonlinear self-diffusion. Our analysis provides insights into equilibrium configurations and stability, revealing clear correspondences among the macroscopic models derived from the same kinetic framework. Using dynamical systems theory, we examine the stability of equilibrium states and conduct numerical simulations to validate our findings. These results highlight the significance of spatial interactions in tumor-immune dynamics, paving the way for a structured exploration of therapeutic strategies and further investigations into immune responses in various pathological contexts.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16479</link>

Abstract: Hydrodynamics describes the evolution of macroscopic states in non--equilibrium thermodynamics. Following Onsager reciprocal relations, one can formulate a large class of hydrodynamic equations as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, such Onsager gradient flows have been extensively investigated on optimal transport type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, known as hydrodynamical density manifolds. A typical example is the gradient--drift Fokker--Planck equation, which can be characterized as the gradient flow of the free energy in the Wasserstein-2 metric space. This paper studies geometric calculations on general hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate the associated Levi--Civita connections, gradients, Hessians, and parallel transports, and then derive the corresponding Riemannian and sectional curvatures. Finally, we obtain closed-form formulas for sectional curvatures in one dimensional density manifolds, where the signs of the curvatures are determined by the convexity of the mobility functions. As illustrations, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures for several zero range models, including independent particle systems, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis--Marchioro--Presutti models.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $m$-periodic $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $m$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n\geq 2$, $d&gt;2$ is an integer and $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$ is any fixed (period). As before, we again study counting problems which are inspired by advances on $m$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics and $m$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any fixed $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}_{ \geq 1}$ and (period) $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $m$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is unbounded or zero as $c$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting work of Benedetto along with conjectural work of Hutz on $m$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any prime $p\geq 5$ and any fixed $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that for any fixed (period) $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $m$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply here density, polynomial-counting, field-counting, and Sato-Tate equidistribution results from arithmetic statistics, and thereby obtaining further counting and statistical results on the irreducible monic polynomials, Artin-Mazur zeta functions, algebraic number fields, and lastly on Artin $L$-functions arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>On the common index jump theorem and further developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [LZ02] published in Annals of Mathematics, Long and Zhu established originally the common index jump theorem (CIJT) for symplectic paths in 2002, which has played an important role in later studies on periodic solution orbits for Hamiltonian systems, Reeb flows, and geodesic problems. This (CIJT) was generalized to its enhanced version (ECIJT) by Duan, Long and Wang in [DLW16] in 2016. Started from [GG20] of 2020, and finally in [CGG24] of 2024, a similar index theorem was obtained, i.e., Theorem 3.3 of [CGG24], which was given the name "index recurrence theorem" there. In this short note, we give detailed proofs to show that the major assertions, i.e., the first 4 assertions in the total of 5 assertions, in Theorem 3.3 of [CGG24] as well as all the assertions in [GG20] actually coincide completely with results in (ECIJT) of [DLW16].</description>

      <title>Safe and Near-Optimal Control with Online Dynamics Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving both optimality and safety under unknown system dynamics is a central challenge in real-world deployment of agents. To address this, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning, where sufficient exploration is performed within the space of safe policies. Our method executes $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe policies while $\textit{optimistically}$ exploring informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.</description>

      <title>Switching Among Feedback-Linearizing Output Sets (Melds): Dwell-Time and Compatibility Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study switching among multiple square selections of output functions (melds) drawn from a deck of candidate outputs for nonlinear systems that are static feedback linearizable via outputs. Fixing an operating point, each meld induces a distinct feedback-linearizing coordinate chart defined on a common neighborhood. Switching between melds therefore produces state-dependent coordinate mismatches that are not captured by classical switched-system analyses. We quantify this effect through Lipschitz bounds on the cross-chart maps over a compact safe set and introduce a reference-compatibility constant that measures mismatch among reference families across melds. We derive an explicit dwell-time condition depending on controller decay rates and the compatibility constant, that guarantees exponential decay of the active-output tracking errors between switches, seamless tracking of outputs shared by consecutive melds, and uniform boundedness of the state error within the safe set. A planar 3R manipulator illustrates the results.</description>

      <title>Circular orders: Topology and continuous actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of circularly ordered sets. While the algebraic notion is classical, the general topological theory has received comparatively little attention. In this work we provide a self-contained topological exposition and present several new directions and results: Initiate a systematic study of generalized circularly ordered topological spaces and of continuous group actions on them. Provide a convex uniform structure description of circularly ordered compactifications. This yields a topological analysis of Novak's regular completion and its minimal uniformity. Show that this uniform structures approach implies several new results in the theory of proper $G$-compactifications for topological group actions on abstract ordered spaces. Reexamine functions of bounded variation on circularly ordered sets and prove generalizations of Helly's selection theorem (for circular and linear orders). These developments and the systematic analysis of circular order topologies are motivated by recent applications in topological dynamics, particularly in joint works with Eli Glasner, which demonstrate that circularly ordered dynamical systems provide a natural class of tame dynamics.</description>

      <title>On weak convergence of stochastic wave equation with colored noise on R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following stochastic wave equation on the real line $\partial_t^2 u_{\alpha}=\partial_x^2 u_{\alpha}+b\left(u_\alpha\right)+\sigma\left(u_\alpha\right)\eta_{\alpha}$. The noise $\eta_\alpha$ is white in time and colored in space with a covariance structure $\mathbb{E}[\eta_\alpha(t,x)\eta_\alpha(s,y)]=\delta(t-s)f_\alpha(x-y)$ where $f_\alpha$ is continuous with respect to $\alpha$ in Fourier mode, see assumption 1.2. We prove the continuity of the probability measure induced by the solution $u_\alpha$, in terms of $\alpha$, with respect to the convergence in law in the topology of continuous functions with uniform metric on compact sets. We also give several examples of $f_\alpha$ such that our theorem applies to.</description>
