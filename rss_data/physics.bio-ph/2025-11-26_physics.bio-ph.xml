      <title>Modeling Bioelectric State Transitions in Glial Cells: An ASAL-Inspired Computational Approach to Glioblastoma Initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how glioblastoma (GBM) emerges from initially healthy glial tissue requires models that integrate bioelectrical, metabolic, and multicellular dynamics. This work introduces an ASAL-inspired agent-based framework that simulates bioelectric state transitions in glial cells as a function of mitochondrial efficiency (Meff), ion-channel conductances, gap-junction coupling, and ROS dynamics. Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM. We further apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites) to explore resilience, parameter sensitivity, and the emergence of tumor-like attractors. Early evolutionary runs converge toward depolarized, ROS-dominated regimes characterized by weakened electrical coupling and altered ionic transport. These results highlight mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted bioelectric signaling as sufficient drivers of malignant-like transitions and provide a computational basis for probing the bioelectrical origins of oncogenesis.</description>

      <title>A Single--Index Theory of Optimal Branching: Murray Laws, Gilbert Networks, and Young--Herring Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Murray-type flux-radius laws, Gilbert-type concave transport costs, and Young-Herring triple-junction angle balances are usually treated as separate theories. This work shows that, within a natural class of quadratic, scale-free ledgers for branched networks, all three are different faces of a single structure controlled by one dimensionless index chi. Each edge carries a flux Q, an effective radius r, and a per-length ledger P(Q,r) encoding transport dissipation and structural burden. Under locality, evenness in Q, linear-response (quadratic) dependence, and an exact homogeneity ansatz in (Q,r), any admissible ledger reduces in the scale-free regime to the two-term form P(Q,r) = a Q^2 r^{-p} + b r^m. Local optimality then implies simultaneously: (i) a flux-radius power law with generalized Murray closures at degree-3 nodes; (ii) a Young-Herring-type vector balance with radius weights r^m and a fixed symmetric Y-junction angle; and (iii) an effective flux-only cost of Gilbert/branched-transport type with exponent beta. The exponents alpha and beta, the symmetric angle, and the split between transport and structural cost are all set by chi = m/(m+p) = beta/2. A rigidity theorem shows conversely that any quadratic ledger that yields power-law optimal radii and power-law flux-only cost on an open scaling cone must belong to this two-term family and obey the same Murray-Gilbert-Young dictionary. Examples for Poiseuille, diffusive, and geophysical trees illustrate how chi can be inferred from geometry and used as a falsifiable order parameter for scale-free branching architectures.</description>

      <title>Morphology of mucus films in lung airways: secretion and ciliary evacuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung airways are lined by a film of mucus which protects the epithelium from inhaled particles. To maintain a uniform coating, the mucus that is secreted into airways must be distributed into a film by wall-attached cilia, which constantly convey mucus along the airway. However, the film's natural tendency is to accumulate into humps and plugs, due to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. To understand the behaviour of the film amidst these competing factors, we perform simulations of an idealized tubular airway using a reduced-order thin-film model. The axial boundaries are nonperiodic, allowing for cilia-driven inflow and outflow; a tangential velocity along the tubular wall models ciliary transport, while a localized source at the wall accounts for secretion. On increasing the mucus input rate, we find three distinct film morphologies: (i) uniform flat films; (ii) nonuniform films that are composed of travelling unduloid-shaped humps, separated by mucus-depleted zones; and (iii) films that form an occluding plug. The flat-film regime, absent in closed periodic domains, emerges as a consequence of the convective nature of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in the presence of ciliary transport. Higher secretion rates increase the mean film-thickness and induce a convective-to-absolute transition, which manifests in the appearance of travelling humps. In the plug-forming regime, capillary forces dominate and drive the incoming mucus into a single hump, which resists ciliary translation and remains near the mucus source. Our results show how low-level baseline secretion sustains a protective, uniform mucus film, and how hypersecretion -- stimulated, for example, by inhaled allergens -- produces mucus plugs.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation -- bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Coevolutionary balance of resting-state brain networks in autism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves atypical brain organization, yet the large-scale functional principles underlying these alterations remain incompletely understood. Here we examine whether coevolutionary balance-a network-level energy measure derived from signed interactions and nodal activity states-captures disruptions in resting-state functional connectivity in autistic adults. Using ABIDE I resting-state fMRI data, we constructed whole-brain networks by combining binarized fALFF activity with signed functional correlations and quantified their coevolutionary energy. Compared with matched typically developing adults, the ASD group showed a characteristic redistribution of coevolutionary energy, with more negative global energy but higher (less negative) energy within the default mode network and altered energy in its interactions with dorsal attention and salience networks, indicating a reorganization rather than a uniform loss of balance in intrinsic network organization. These effects replicated across validation analyses with null models designed to disrupt link or node structure. Coevolutionary energy also showed modest but significant associations with ADI-R social and communication scores. Finally, incorporating coevolutionary features into a leakage-safe machine-learning classifier supported above-chance ASD versus typically developing (TD) discrimination on a held-out test set. These findings suggest that coevolutionary balance offers a compact, interpretable descriptor of altered resting-state network dynamics in autism.</description>

      <title>Swarming and Flocking Unified Through Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural flocks (aligned) and swarms (non-aligned) both exhibit features of near-criticality, challenging their treatment as two ends of the same phase transition. We present a model for the aggregation of active individuals, in which their velocities align as a byproduct of achieving stable cohesion. In our framework, individuals move in open space and possess differing self-propelling velocities. Furthermore, velocity fluctuations are triggered by individual errors when following the aggregation rules. Notably, the system exhibits scale invariance, which is shown to be rooted in the model's definition -- a feature that we label as structural criticality. Finally, we show the emergence of a striking regime where spatial and orientational coherence decouple. That is, the system can achieve states of high and low polarization while maintaining spatial homogeneity.</description>
