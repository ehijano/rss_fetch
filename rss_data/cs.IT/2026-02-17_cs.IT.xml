      <title>Sequential BP-based Decoding of QLDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are a leading approach to quantum error correction, yet conventional belief propagation (BP) decoders often perform poorly, primarily due to non-convergence exacerbated by stabilizer constraints, which induce short cycles and degeneracy. We propose two scheduling variants, sequential check node scheduling (SCNS) and sequential variable node scheduling (SVNS), that improve BP's error-correction ability by processing check nodes (CNs) or variable nodes (VNs), respectively, in a fixed order, stabilizing message updates and reducing stalls. We also employ this technique to an improved BP-variant called BP guided decimation (BPGD), where symbols are progressively fixed during decoding iterations. Here, we demonstrate that the sequential BPGD (SBPGD) decoder can further improve the convergence properties and performance of the decoder. On standard QLDPC benchmarks under a Pauli-X noise model, our sequential schedules are shown to lower the block error rate relative to conventional BP, and SBPGD outperforms BPGD while using significantly fewer decimation rounds, translating to lower computational cost. These results demonstrate that changing the update schedule, without altering the code, can improve both the reliability and efficiency of BP-based decoding for QLDPC codes. For the [[1922,50,16]] C2 hypergraph-product code with independent X errors, SVNS-BP surpasses BP-OSD-0 in error correction at roughly the same complexity as standard BP.</description>

      <title>End-to-End NOMA with Perfect and Quantized CSI Over Rayleigh Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An end-to-end autoencoder (AE) framework is developed for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over Rayleigh fading channels, which learns interference-aware and channel-adaptive super-constellations. While existing works either assume additive white Gaussian noise channels or treat fading channels without a fully end-to-end learning approach, our framework directly embeds the wireless channel into both training and inference. To account for practical channel state information (CSI), we further incorporate limited feedback via both uniform and Lloyd-Max quantization of channel gains and analyze their impact on AE training and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that, with perfect CSI, the proposed AE outperforms the existing analytical NOMA schemes. In addition, Lloyd-Max quantization achieves superior BER performance compared to uniform quantization. These results demonstrate that end-to-end AEs trained directly over Rayleigh fading can effectively learn robust, interference-aware signaling strategies, paving the way for NOMA deployment in fading environments with realistic CSI constraints.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Invariant for Free Convolutional Codes over Finite Local Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic structure of free convolutional codes over the finite local ring Z_{p^r}. We introduce a new structural invariant, the Residual Structural Polynomial, denoted by Delta_p(C) in F_p[D]. We construct this invariant via encoders which are reduced internal degree matrices (RIDM). We formally demonstrate that Delta_p(C) is an intrinsic characteristic of the code, invariant under equivalent RIDMs. A central result of this work is the establishment that Delta_p(C) serves as an algebraic criterion for intrinsic catastrophicity: we prove that a free code C admits a non-catastrophic realization if and only if Delta_p(C) is a monomial of the form D^s. Furthermore, we establish a fundamental duality theorem, proving that Delta_p(C) = Delta_p(C^perp). This result reveals a deep structural symmetry, showing that the "catastrophicity" of a free code is preserved under orthogonality.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Differential Entropies -- II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that under convergence in measure of probability density functions, differential entropy converges whenever the entropy integrands $f_n |\log f_n|$ are uniformly integrable and tight -- a direct consequence of Vitali's convergence theorem. We give an entropy-weighted Orlicz condition: $\sup_n \int f_n\, \Psi(|\log f_n|) &lt; \infty$ for a single superlinear $\Psi$, strictly weaker than the fixed-$\alpha$ condition of Godavarti and Hero (2004). We also disprove the Godavarti-Hero conjecture that $\alpha &gt; 1$ could be replaced by $\alpha_n \downarrow 1$. We recover the sufficient conditions of Godavarti-Hero, Piera-Parada, and Ghourchian-Gohari-Amini as corollaries, and we show the condition is also necessary on bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Constructing Quantum Convolutional Codes via Difference Triangle Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a construction of quantum convolutional codes (QCCs) based on difference triangle sets (DTSs). To construct QCCs, one must determine polynomial stabilizers $X(D)$ and $Z(D)$ that commute (symplectic orthogonality), while keeping the stabilizers sparse and encoding memory small. To construct Z(D), we show that one can use a reflection of the DTS indices of X(D), where X(D) corresponds to a classical convolutional self-orthogonal code (CSOC) constructed from strong DTS supports. The motivation of this approach is to provide a constructive design that guarantees a prescribed minimum distance. We provide numerical results demonstrating the construction for a variety of code rates.</description>

      <title>Redundancy-Optimal Constructions of $(1,1)$-Criss-Cross Deletion Correcting Codes with Efficient Encoding/Decoding Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional error-correcting codes, where codewords are represented as $n \times n$ arrays over a $q$-ary alphabet, find important applications in areas such as QR codes, DNA-based storage, and racetrack memories. Among the possible error patterns, $(t_r,t_c)$-criss-cross deletions-where $t_r$ rows and $t_c$ columns are simultaneously deleted-are of particular significance. In this paper, we focus on $q$-ary $(1,1)$-criss-cross deletion correcting codes. We present a novel code construction and develop complete encoding, decoding, and data recovery algorithms for parameters $n \ge 11$ and $q \ge 3$. The complexity of the proposed encoding, decoding, and data recovery algorithms is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Furthermore, we show that for $n \ge 11$ and $q = \Omega(n)$ (i.e., there exists a constant $c&gt;0$ such that $q \ge cn$), both the code redundancy and the encoder redundancy of the constructed codes are $2n + 2\log_q n + \mathcal{O}(1)$, which attain the lower bound ($2n + 2\log_q n - 3$) within an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gap. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction that can achieve the optimal redundancy with only an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gap, while simultaneously featuring explicit encoding and decoding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Space Generative AI Pipeline for Semantic Transmission of Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Discernment, a semantic communication system that transmits the meaning of physical signals (baseband radio and audio) over a technical channel using GenAI models operating in discrete spaces. Discernment dynamically adapts to channel impairments - modeled as erasure channels - by switching between an autoregressive or a diffusion-based generative algorithm, depending on the erasure pattern. Our results show that Discernment maintains semantic integrity even as channel capacity severely degrades, exhibiting very small and graceful performance decline in both classification accuracy and statistical fidelity of the reconstructed meaning. These findings demonstrate Discernment's ability to adjust to diverse physical channel conditions while maintaining spectral efficiency and low model complexity, making it well suited for IoT deployments and strongly motivating further research on this semantic channel paradigm.</description>

      <title>UAV Swarm Enabled Aerial Movable Antenna System for Low-Altitude Economy: From Far-Field to Near-Field Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) mobility provides an ideal platform for implementing aerial movable antenna (AMA) system enabled by UAV swarm cooperation. Besides, AMA system is readily to achieve an extremely large-scale array aperture, rendering the conventional far-field uniform plane wave (UPW) model no longer valid for aerial-to-ground links. This paper studies the UAV swarm enabled near-field AMA communication, by taking into account the non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) model, where UAV swarm trajectory simultaneously influences the channel amplitude and phase. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum average communication rate over user equipments (UEs), by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm trajectory and receive beamforming for all UEs. To draw useful insights, the special case of single UE is first studied, and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is proposed to efficiently optimize the UAV swarm trajectory. For the special case of placement optimization, the optimal placement positions of UAVs for cases of single UAV and two UAVs are derived in closed-form. Then, for the special case of two UEs, we show that an inter-UE interference (IUI)-free communication can be achieved by symmetrically placing an even number of UAVs along a hyperbola, with its foci corresponding to the locations of the two UEs. Furthermore, for arbitrary number of UEs, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to efficiently tackle the non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results validate the significant performance gains over the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>BRAIN: Bayesian Reasoning via Active Inference for Agentic and Embodied Intelligence in Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks will demand artificial intelligence (AI) agents that are not only autonomous and efficient, but also capable of real-time adaptation in dynamic environments and transparent in their decisionmaking. However, prevailing agentic AI approaches in networking, exhibit significant shortcomings in this regard. Conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based agents lack explainability and often suffer from brittle adaptation, including catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge under non-stationary conditions. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution for these challenges: Bayesian reasoning via Active Inference (BRAIN) agent. BRAIN harnesses a deep generative model of the network environment and minimizes variational free energy to unify perception and action in a single closed-loop paradigm. We implement BRAIN as O-RAN eXtended application (xApp) on GPU-accelerated testbed and demonstrate its advantages over standard DRL baselines. In our experiments, BRAIN exhibits (i) robust causal reasoning for dynamic radio resource allocation, maintaining slice-specific quality of service (QoS) targets (throughput, latency, reliability) under varying traffic loads, (ii) superior adaptability with up to 28.3% higher robustness to sudden traffic shifts versus benchmarks (achieved without any retraining), and (iii) real-time interpretability of its decisions through human-interpretable belief state diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas systems (PASSs) have recently been proposed as a novel flexible-antenna technology. These systems are implemented by attaching low-cost pinching elements to dielectric waveguides. As the direct link is bypassed through waveguides, PASSs can effectively compensate large-scale effects of the wireless channel. This work explores the potential gains of employing PASSs for over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL). For a PASS-assisted server, we develop a low-complexity algorithmic approach, which jointly tunes the PASS parameters and schedules the mobile devices for minimal energy consumption in OTA-FL. We study the efficiency of the proposed design and compare it against the conventional OTA-FL setting with MIMO server. Numerical experiments demonstrate that using a single-waveguide PASS at the server within a moderately sized area, the required energy for model aggregation is drastically reduced as compared to the case with fully-digital MIMO server. This introduces PASS as a potential technology for energy-efficient distributed learning in next generations of wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Diversity vs Degrees of Freedom in Gaussian Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard definitions of degrees of freedom (DOF) and diversity both normalize by $\log\rho$. When this ruler is wrong, both measurements give zero or become undefined, yet intuitively DOF and diversity ought to be channel properties, not artifacts of a normalization choice. We formalize this for Gaussian fading channels. For fixed-$H$ MIMO, DOF and diversity are both ranks of the bilinear map~$HX$ with different variables free: $\varepsilon$-covering the image of~$X\!\mapsto\!HX$ gives DOF on the $\log\rho$ gauge; expanding across all dimensions of the fading map gives diversity on the linear~$\rho$ gauge. Covering produces logs; expansion produces linear growth; so in every model studied here the two gauges differ. These geometric definitions do not yield tradeoff curves. We bridge the gap with Bhattacharyya packing, obtaining gauge-DOF and B-diversity as workable proxies -- finite and informative on every gauge, including those where the classical diversity order is zero. Three gauge classes emerge: $\log\rho$, $\log\log\rho$, and $(\log\rho)^\beta$, $\beta\in(0,1)$. The main result is a cross-gauge tradeoff for noncoherent fast fading: capacity lives on $\log\log\rho$, but B-diversity lives on $\log\rho$, exponentially larger, with matching upper and lower bounds. For coherent MIMO, block fading, and irregular-spectrum channels, the same approach recovers or extends known scaling laws.</description>

      <title>On the Rate-Distortion-Complexity Tradeoff for Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on conveying the user's intended meaning rather than the bit-wise transmission of source signals. One of the key challenges is to effectively represent and extract the semantic meaning of any given source signals. While deep learning (DL)-based solutions have shown promising results in extracting implicit semantic information from a wide range of sources, existing work often overlooks the high computational complexity inherent in both model training and inference for the DL-based encoder and decoder. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) framework which extends the classical rate-distortion theory by incorporating the constraints on semantic distance, including both the traditional bit-wise distortion metric and statistical difference-based divergence metric, and complexity measure, adopted from the theory of minimum description length and information bottleneck. We derive the closed-form theoretical results of the minimum achievable rate under given constraints on semantic distance and complexity for both Gaussian and binary semantic sources. Our theoretical results show a fundamental three-way tradeoff among achievable rate, semantic distance, and model complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world image and video datasets validate this tradeoff and further demonstrate that our information-theoretic complexity measure effectively correlates with practical computational costs, guiding efficient system design in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Center-Fed Pinching Antenna System (C-PASS): Modeling, Analysis, and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized framework for the novel center-fed pinching antenna system (C-PASS) is proposed. Within this framework, closed-form expressions for the degree of freedom (DoF) and power scaling law of the proposed C-PASS are first derived. These theoretical results reveal that the achievable DoF scales linearly with the number of input ports, $M$, and the number of receive antennas, $K$. Furthermore, the derived power scaling laws demonstrate that the C-PASS achieves a power gain of order $\mathcal{O}(P_T M)$, where $P_T$ denotes the transmit power. Based on the proposed C-PASS modeling, a sum-rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is then formulated. To solve this highly coupled non-convex problem, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed. More particularly, the transmit precoding and power splitting ratios are updated via derived closed-form solutions, while the pinching antenna positions and radiation coefficients are optimized using block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Finally, our numerical results reveal that the single-waveguide C-PASS: 1) achieves superior DoF and power scaling laws compared to the single-waveguide PASS; and 2) outperforms the multi-waveguide PASS in high-attenuation regimes, yielding a substantial gain exceeding $10$ dB.</description>

      <title>Constructions of linear codes from vectorial plateaued functions and their subfield codes with applications to quantum CSS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear codes over finite fields parameterized by functions have proven to be a powerful tool in coding theory, yielding optimal and few-weight codes with significant applications in secret sharing, authentication codes, and association schemes. In 2023, Xu et al. introduced a construction framework for 3-dimensional linear codes parameterized by two functions, which has demonstrated considerable success in generating infinite families of optimal linear codes. Motivated by this approach, we propose a construction that extends the framework to three functions, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the parameters. Additionally, we introduce a vectorial setting by allowing vector-valued functions, expanding the construction space and the set of achievable structural properties. We analyze both scalar and vectorial frameworks, employing Bent and s-Plateaued functions, including Almost Bent, to define the code generators. By exploiting the properties of the Walsh transform, we determine the explicit parameters and weight distributions of these codes and their punctured versions. A key result of this study is that the constructed codes have few weights, and their duals are distance and dimensionally optimal with respect to both the Sphere Packing and Griesmer bounds. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between our vectorial approach and the classical first generic construction of linear codes, providing sufficient conditions for the resulting codes to be minimal and self-orthogonal. Finally, we investigate applications to quantum coding theory within the Calderbank-Shor-Steane framework.</description>

      <title>SIM-assisted Secure Mobile Communications via Enhanced Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, the security challenges are becoming increasingly prominent, especially for mobile users (MUs). As a promising solution, physical layer security (PLS) technology leverages the inherent characteristics of wireless channels to provide security assurance. Particularly, stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) directly manipulates electromagnetic waves through their multilayer structures, offering significant potential for enhancing PLS performance in an energy efficient manner. Thus, in this work, we investigate an SIM-assisted secure communication system for MUs under the threat of an eavesdropper, addressing practical challenges such as channel uncertainty in mobile environments, multiple MU interference, and residual hardware impairments. Consequently, we formulate a joint power and phase shift optimization problem (JPPSOP), aiming at maximizing the achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of all MUs. Given the non-convexity and dynamic nature of this optimization problem, we propose an enhanced proximal policy optimization algorithm with a bidirectional long short-term memory mechanism, an off-policy data utilization mechanism, and a policy feedback mechanism (PPO-BOP). Through these mechanisms, the proposed algorithm can effectively capture short-term channel fading and long-term MU mobility, improve sample utilization efficiency, and enhance exploration capabilities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that PPO-BOP significantly outperforms benchmark strategies and other deep reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of ASR.10.1109/TWC.2026.3658332</description>

      <title>From Snapshot Sensing to Persistent EM World Modeling: A Generative-Space Perspective for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) world modeling is emerging as a foundational capability for environment-aware and embodiment-enabled wireless systems. However, most existing mmWave sensing solutions are designed for snapshot-based parameter estimation and rely on hardware-intensive architectures, making scalable and persistent world modeling difficult to achieve. This article rethinks mmWave sensing from a system-level perspective and introduces a generative-space framework, in which sensing is realized through controlled traversal of a low-dimensional excitation space spanning frequency, waveform, and physical embodiment. This perspective decouples spatial observability from rigid antenna arrays and transmit-time multiplexing, enabling flexible and scalable sensing-by-design radios. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, we present a representative realization called Multi-RF Chain Frequency-as-Aperture Clip-on Aperture Fabric (MRC-FaA-CAF), where multiple FMCW sources coordinate frequency-selective modules distributed along guided-wave backbones. This architecture enables interference-free excitation, preserves beat-frequency separability, and maintains low calibration overhead. Case studies show that generative-space-driven sensing can achieve update rates comparable to phased arrays while avoiding dense RF replication and the latency penalties of TDM-MIMO systems. Overall, this work positions generative-space-driven sensing as a practical architectural foundation for mmWave systems that move beyond snapshot sensing toward persistent EM world modeling.</description>

      <title>Parametric-Sensitivity Aware Retransmission for Efficient AI Downloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The edge artificial intelligence (AI) applications in next-generation mobile networks demand efficient AI-model downloading techniques to support real-time, on-device inference. However, transmitting high-dimensional AI models over wireless channels remains challenging due to limited communication resources. To address this issue, we propose a parametric-sensitivity-aware retransmission (PASAR) framework that manages radio-resource usage of different parameter packets according to their importance on model inference accuracy, known as parametric sensitivity. Empirical analysis reveals a highly right-skewed sensitivity distribution, indicating that only a small fraction of parameters significantly affect model performance. Leveraging this insight, we design a novel online retransmission protocol, i.e., the PASAR protocol, that adaptively terminates packet transmission based on real-time bit error rate (BER) measurements and the associated parametric sensitivity. The protocol employs an adaptive, round-wise stopping criterion, enabling heterogeneous, packet-level retransmissions that preserve overall model functionality but reduce overall latency. Extensive experiments across diverse deep neural network architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that PASAR substantially outperforms classical hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) schemes in terms of communication efficiency and latency.</description>

      <title>Locally Private Parametric Methods for Change-Point Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parametric change-point detection, where the goal is to identify distributional changes in time series, under local differential privacy. In the non-private setting, we derive improved finite-sample accuracy guarantees for a change-point detection algorithm based on the generalized log-likelihood ratio test, via martingale methods. In the private setting, we propose two locally differentially private algorithms based on randomized response and binary mechanisms, and analyze their theoretical performance. We derive bounds on detection accuracy and validate our results through empirical evaluation. Our results characterize the statistical cost of local differential privacy in change-point detection and show how privacy degrades performance relative to a non-private benchmark. As part of this analysis, we establish a structural result for strong data processing inequalities (SDPI), proving that SDPI coefficients for R\'enyi divergences and their symmetric variants (Jeffreys-R\'enyi divergences) are achieved by binary input distributions. These results on SDPI coefficients are also of independent interest, with applications to statistical estimation, data compression, and Markov chain mixing.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Conditional Gaussian Processes (Ens-CGP): Representation, Geometry, and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate Ensemble-Conditional Gaussian Processes (Ens-CGP), a finite-dimensional synthesis that centers ensemble-based inference on the conditional Gaussian law. Conditional Gaussian processes (CGP) arise directly from Gaussian processes under conditioning and, in linear-Gaussian settings, define the full posterior distribution for a Gaussian prior and linear observations. Classical Kalman filtering is a recursive algorithm that computes this same conditional law under dynamical assumptions; the conditional Gaussian law itself is therefore the underlying representational object, while the filter is one computational realization. In this sense, CGP provides the probabilistic foundation for Kalman-type methods as well as equivalent formulations as a strictly convex quadratic program (MAP estimation), RKHS-regularized regression, and classical regularization. Ens-CGP is the ensemble instantiation of this object, obtained by treating empirical ensemble moments as a (possibly low-rank) Gaussian prior and performing exact conditioning. By separating representation (GP -&gt; CGP -&gt; Ens-CGP) from computation (Kalman filters, EnKF variants, and iterative ensemble schemes), the framework links an earlier-established representational foundation for inference to ensemble-derived priors and clarifies the relationships among probabilistic, variational, and ensemble perspectives.</description>

      <title>Wideband Quantum Transduction for Rydberg Atomic Receivers Using Six-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers hold extremely high sensitivity to electric fields, yet their effective 3-dB baseband bandwidth under conventional electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is typically constrained to tens to a few hundreds of kilohertz, which hinders wideband wireless applications. To relax this bottleneck, we investigate a six-wave mixing (SWM)-based Rydberg atomic receiver as a wideband radio frequency (RF)-to-optical quantum transducer. Specifically, we develop an explicit baseband input-output model spanning from the probe input to the output light field. Based upon this model, a closed-form 3-dB bandwidth expression is derived to expose its dependence on key optical and RF parameters. We further quantify the linear dynamic range by employing the 1-dB compression point (P1dB) and the input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3), unveiling a communication-compatible characterization of the bandwidth-linearity trade-off. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate that, given identical optical driving conditions, the SWM configuration increases the 3-dB baseband bandwidth by more than an order of magnitude compared to the EIT-based counterpart, while retaining comparable electric-field sensitivity and revealing a broad, tunable linear operating region.</description>

      <title>The Inevitability of Side-Channel Leakage in Encrypted Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of TLS 1.3 and QUIC has rendered payload content invisible, shifting traffic analysis toward side-channel features. However, rigorous justification for why side-channel leakage is inevitable in encrypted communications has been lacking. This paper establishes a strict foundation from information theory by constructing a formal model \(\Sigma=(\Gamma,\Omega)\), where \(\Gamma=(A,\Pi,\Phi,N)\) describes the causal chain of application generation, protocol encapsulation, encryption transformation, and network transmission, while \(\Omega\) characterizes observation capabilities. Based on composite channel structure, data processing inequality, and Lipschitz statistics propagation, we propose and prove the Side-Channel Existence Theorem: for distinguishable semantic pairs, under conditions including mapping non-degeneracy (\(\mathbb{E}[d(z_P,z_N)\mid X]\le C\)), protocol-layer distinguishability (expectation difference \(\ge\bar\Delta\)), Lipschitz continuity, observation non-degeneracy (\(\rho&gt;0\)), and propagation condition (\(C&lt;\bar\Delta/2L_\varphi\)), the mutual information \(I(X;Y)\) is strictly positive with explicit lower bound. The corollary shows that in efficiency-prioritized systems, leakage is inevitable when at least one application pair is distinguishable. Three factors determine the boundary: non-degeneracy constant \(C\) constrained by efficiency, distinguishability \(\bar\Delta\) from application diversity, and \(\rho\) from analyst capabilities. This establishes the first rigorous information-theoretic foundation for encrypted traffic side channels, providing verifiable predictions for attack feasibility, quantifiable benchmarks for defenses, and mathematical basis for efficiency-privacy tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>Convexity Meets Curvature: Lifted Near-Field Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extra-large apertures, high carrier frequencies, and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) are pushing array processing into the Fresnel region, where spherical wavefronts induce a range-dependent phase across the aperture. This curvature breaks the Fourier/Vandermonde structure behind classical subspace methods, and it is especially limiting with hybrid front-ends that provide only a small number of pilot measurements. Consequently, practical systems need continuous angle resolution and joint angle-range inference where many near-field approaches still rely on costly 2D gridding. We show that convexity can meet curvature via a lifted, gridless superresolution framework for near-field measurements. The key is a Bessel-Vandermonde factorization of the Fresnel-phase manifold that exposes a hidden Vandermonde structure in angle while isolating the range dependence into a compact coefficient map. Building on this, we introduce a lifting that maps each range bin and continuous angle to a structured rank-one atom, converting the nonlinear near-field model into a linear inverse problem over a row-sparse matrix. Recovery is posed as atomic-norm minimization and an explicit dual characterization via bounded trigonometric polynomials yields certificate-based localization that super-resolves off-grid angles and identifies active range bins. Simulations with strongly undersampled hybrid observations validate reliable joint angle-range recovery for next-generation wireless and ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-assisted Positioning in Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of high-precision target localization in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the target is sensed via both a direct path and a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted reflection path. We first develop a sequential matched-filter estimator to acquire coarse angular parameters, followed by a range recovery process based on subcarrier phase differences. Subsequently, we formulate the target localization problem as a non-linear least squares optimization, using the coarse estimates to initialize the target's position coordinates. To solve this efficiently, we introduce a fast iterative refinement algorithm tailored for RIS-aided ISAC environments. Recognizing that the signal model involves both linear path gains and non-linear geometric dependencies, we exploit the separable least-squares structure to decouple these parameters. Furthermore, we propose a modified Levenberg algorithm with an approximation strategy, which enables low-cost parameter updates without necessitating repeated evaluations of the full non-linear model. Simulation results show that the proposed refinement method achieves accuracy comparable to conventional approaches, while significantly reducing algorithmic complexity.</description>

Abstract: The paper treats the financial market as a communication system, using four information-theoretic assumptions to derive an idealized model with only one parameter. State variables are scalar stationary diffusions. The model minimizes the surprisal of the market and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the benchmark-neutral pricing measure and the real-world probability measure. The state variables, their sums, and the growth optimal portfolio of the stocks evolve as squared radial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in respective activity times.</description>

      <title>The Well-Tempered Classifier: Some Elementary Properties of Temperature Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature scaling is a simple method that allows to control the uncertainty of probabilistic models. It is mostly used in two contexts: improving the calibration of classifiers and tuning the stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In both cases, temperature scaling is the most popular method for the job. Despite its popularity, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of temperature scaling has remained elusive. We investigate here some of these properties. For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense (and in particular increases its entropy). However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy. The second characterisation clarifies the role of temperature scaling as a submodel of more general linear scalers such as matrix scaling and Dirichlet calibration: we show that temperature scaling is the only linear scaler that does not change the hard predictions of the model.</description>

      <title>Random geometric graphs with smooth kernels: sharp detection threshold and a spectral conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A random geometric graph (RGG) with kernel $K$ is constructed by first sampling latent points $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ independently and uniformly from the $d$-dimensional unit sphere, then connecting each pair $(i,j)$ with probability $K(\langle x_i,x_j\rangle)$. We study the sharp detection threshold, namely the highest dimension at which an RGG can be distinguished from its Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi counterpart with the same edge density.
  For dense graphs, we show that for smooth kernels the critical scaling is $d = n^{3/4}$, substantially lower than the threshold $d = n^3$ known for the hard RGG with step-function kernels \cite{bubeck2016testing}. We further extend our results to kernels whose signal-to-noise ratio scales with $n$, and formulate a unifying conjecture that the critical dimension is determined by $n^3 \mathop{\rm tr}^2(\kappa^3) = 1$, where $\kappa$ is the standardized kernel operator on the sphere.
  Departing from the prevailing approach of bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence by successively exposing latent points, which breaks down in the sublinear regime of $d=o(n)$, our key technical contribution is a careful analysis of the posterior distribution of the latent points given the observed graph, in particular, the overlap between two independent posterior samples. As a by-product, we establish that $d=\sqrt{n}$ is the critical dimension for non-trivial estimation of the latent vectors up to a global rotation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling with Discrete Diffusion Models: Sharp and Adaptive Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models over discrete spaces have recently shown striking empirical success, yet their theoretical foundations remain incomplete. In this paper, we study the sampling efficiency of score-based discrete diffusion models under a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation, with a focus on $\tau$-leaping-based samplers. We establish sharp convergence guarantees for attaining $\varepsilon$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for both uniform and masking noising processes. For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the $\tau$-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order $\tilde O(d/\varepsilon)$, with $d$ the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size $S$ and improving existing bounds by a factor of $d$; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified $\tau$-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by $d \log S$ but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples (such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs). Our analysis requires no boundedness or smoothness assumptions on the score estimator beyond control of the score entropy loss.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication for Low-Altitude Economy with UAV Swarm Enabled Two-Level Movable Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a key enabling platform for low-altitude economy, due to its advantages such as 3D maneuverability, flexible deployment, and LoS air-to-air/ground communication links. In particular, the intrinsic high mobility renders UAV especially suitable for operating as a movable antenna (MA) from the sky. In this paper, by exploiting the flexible mobility of UAV swarm and antenna position adjustment of MA, we propose a novel UAV swarm enabled two-level MA system, where UAVs not only individually deploy a local MA array, but also form a larger-scale MA system with their individual MA arrays via swarm coordination. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all ground user equipments (UEs), by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm placement positions, their individual MAs' positions, and receive beamforming for different UEs. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case where each UAV has only one antenna, under different scenarios of one single UE, two UEs, and arbitrary number of UEs. In particular, for the two-UE case, we derive the optimal UAV swarm placement positions in closed-form that achieves IUI-free communication when the uniform plane wave (UPW) model holds, where the UAV swarm forms a uniform sparse array (USA) satisfying minimum safe distance constraint. While for the general case with arbitrary number of UEs, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem. Then, we extend the results to the case where each UAV is equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results verify that the proposed low-altitude UAV swarm enabled MA system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, thanks to the exploitation of two-level mobility to create more favorable channel conditions for multi-UE communications.</description>

      <title>Non-Orthogonal Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Spectrally Efficient High-Mobility Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-orthogonal affine frequency division multiplexing (nAFDM) waveform for reliable high-mobility communications with enhanced spectral efficiency (SE). The key idea is to introduce a bandwidth compression factor into the AFDM modulator to enable controllable subcarrier overlapping. We first detail the proposed nAFDM transceiver and derive the corresponding input-output signal relationship. Then, an efficient nAFDM signal generation method based on the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is proposed, enabling practical implementation using existing inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) modules without additional hardware complexity. Next, to characterize the impact of non-orthogonal modulation, we derive a closed-form expression of inter-carrier interference (ICI), showing its dependence on the bandwidth compression factor. To mitigate the resulting interference, we propose a soft iterative detection algorithm and a low-complexity implementation approach that leverages the distribution characteristics of ICI. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) in terms of bit error rate (BER), the proposed nAFDM can achieve near identical BER compared to conventional AFDM, while outperforms other waveform counterparts; 2) nAFDM is capable of striking higher SE compared to other existing waveforms; and 3) the proposed nAFDM achieves an attractive BER vs. SE trade-off, and the proposed soft iterative detection (ID) scheme can attain a trade-off between BER and complexity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu [{\em Math. Comp.}, 94 (2025), pp.~2931--2960]. Previous work has established that $E_m$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.</description>

      <title>Forward-Forward Autoencoder Architectures for Energy-Efficient Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of deep learning to the area of communications systems has been a growing field of interest in recent years. Forward-forward (FF) learning is an efficient alternative to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the typically used training procedure for neural networks. Among its several advantages, FF learning does not require the communication channel to be differentiable and does not rely on the global availability of partial derivatives, allowing for an energy-efficient implementation. In this work, we design end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and numerically evaluate their performance for the additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh block fading channels. We demonstrate their competitiveness with BP-trained systems in the case of joint coding and modulation, and in a scenario where a fixed, non-differentiable modulation stage is applied. Moreover, we provide further insights into the design principles of the FF network, its training convergence behavior, and significant memory and processing time savings compared to BP-based approaches.</description>

      <title>What Can Be Recovered Under Sparse Adversarial Corruption? Assumption-Free Theory for Linear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix and $e$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $y = A x^\star + e$ and $q$, we seek the smallest robust solution set containing $x^\star$ that is uniformly recoverable from $y$ without knowing $e$. While exact recovery of $x^\star$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $A$ or $x^\star$ (e.g., restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $A$ and $x^\star$ remains open. Our main result shows that the smallest robust solution set is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.</description>

      <title>Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

Abstract: We derive Singleton-type bounds on the free distance and column distances of trellis codes. Our results show that, at a given time instant, the maximum attainable column distance of trellis codes can exceed that of convolutional codes. Moreover, using expander graphs, we construct trellis codes over constant-size alphabets that achieve a rate-distance trade-off arbitrarily close to that of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile. By comparison, all known constructions of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile require working over alphabets whose size grows at least exponentially with the number of output symbols per time instant.</description>

      <title>Universal Asymptotics for Jensen--Shannon Divergence under Shuffling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Jensen--Shannon divergence (JSD) between transcript distributions induced by neighboring datasets in the shuffle model when each user applies a fixed local randomizer and a trusted shuffler releases the output histogram. Under a mild positivity assumption, we prove an explicit two-term asymptotic expansion where the leading term is chi-squared divergence divided by 8n. Binary randomized response and k-ary randomized response follow as corollaries. For multi-message protocols based on independent repetition, the leading coefficient becomes (1 + chi-squared)^m - 1. A fully explicit remainder control is provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic Limits of Cardinality Estimation: Fisher Meets Shannon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the cardinality (number of distinct elements) of a large multiset is a classic problem in streaming and sketching. In this paper we study the intrinsic tradeoff between the space complexity of the sketch and its estimation error. We define a new measure of efficiency for data sketches called the Fisher-Shannon (FiSh) number $\mathcal{H}/\mathcal{I}$. It captures the tension between the limiting Shannon entropy ($\mathcal{H}$) of the sketch and its normalized Fisher information ($\mathcal{I}$) that characterizes the variance of a statistically efficient, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our aim in introducing the FiSh-number is to build the mathematical machinery necessary to argue for precise optimality, rather than asymptotic optimality, up to large constant factors. Our results are as follows. [1] We prove that all base-$q$ variants of Flajolet and Martin's PCSA sketch have FiSh-number $H_0/I_0 \approx 1.98016$ and that every base-$q$ variant of HyperLogLog has FiSh-number worse than $H_0/I_0$, but that they tend to $H_0/I_0$ in the limit as $q\rightarrow \infty$. Here $H_0,I_0$ are precisely defined constants. [2] We describe a sketch called Fishmonger that is based on a smoothed, entropy-compressed variant of PCSA with a different estimator function. Fishmonger processes a multiset of $[U]$ such that at all times, w.h.p., its space is $(1+o(1))(H_0/I_0)m \approx 1.98m$ bits and its standard error is $1/\sqrt{m}$. For example, to achieve a 1% standard error, one needs a little more than 19,800 bits, or $\approx 2.42$ kilobytes. [3] Finally, we give circumstantial evidence that $H_0/I_0$ is the optimum FiSh-number of mergeable sketches for Cardinality Estimation. We define a natural subset of mergeable sketches called linearizable sketches and prove that no member of this class can beat $H_0/I_0$. The popular mergeable sketches are, in fact, also linearizable.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Nonconvex Low-Rank Tensor Estimation via Scaled Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: Tensors, which give a faithful and effective representation to deliver the intrinsic structure of multi-dimensional data, play a crucial role in an increasing number of signal processing and machine learning problems. However, tensor data are often accompanied by arbitrary signal corruptions, including missing entries and sparse noise. A fundamental challenge is to reliably extract the meaningful information from corrupted tensor data in a statistically and computationally efficient manner. This paper develops a scaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly estimate the tensor factors with tailored spectral initializations under the tensor-tensor product (t-product) and tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) framework. With tailored variants for tensor robust principal component analysis, (robust) tensor completion and tensor regression, we theoretically show that ScaledGD achieves linear convergence at a constant rate that is independent of the condition number of the ground truth low-rank tensor, while maintaining the low per-iteration cost of gradient descent. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that provably has such properties for low-rank tensor estimation with the t-SVD. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of ScaledGD in accelerating the convergence rate of ill-conditioned low-rank tensor estimation in a number of applications.</description>

      <title>Regularized Top-$k$: A Bayesian Framework for Gradient Sparsification</title>

Abstract: Error accumulation is effective for gradient sparsification in distributed settings: initially-unselected gradient entries are eventually selected as their accumulated error exceeds a certain level. The accumulation essentially behaves as a scaling of the learning rate for the selected entries. Although this property prevents the slow-down of lateral movements in distributed gradient descent, it can deteriorate convergence in some settings. This work proposes a novel sparsification scheme that controls the learning rate scaling of error accumulation. The development of this scheme follows two major steps: first, gradient sparsification is formulated as an inverse probability (inference) problem, and the Bayesian optimal sparsification mask is derived as a maximum-a-posteriori estimator. Using the prior distribution inherited from Top-k, we derive a new sparsification algorithm which can be interpreted as a regularized form of Top-k. We call this algorithm regularized Top-k (RegTop-k). It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior statistics of the next aggregation. It then prioritizes the local accumulated gradient entries based on these posterior statistics. We validate our derivation through various numerical experiments. In distributed linear regression, it is observed that while Top-k remains at a fixed distance from the global optimum, RegTop-k converges to the global optimum at significantly higher compression ratios. We further demonstrate the generalization of this observation by employing RegTop-k in distributed training of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, as well as fine-tuning of multiple computer vision models on the ImageNette dataset. Our numerical results confirm that as the compression ratio increases, RegTop-k sparsification noticeably outperforms Top-k.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sensing holds great promise for high-precision magnetic field measurements. However, its performance is significantly limited by noise. The investigation of active quantum error correction to address this noise led to the Hamiltonian-Not-in-Lindblad-Span (HNLS) condition. This states that Heisenberg scaling is achievable if and only if the signal Hamiltonian is orthogonal to the span of the Lindblad operators describing the noise. In this work, we consider a robust quantum metrology setting where the probe state is inspired from CSS codes for noise resilience but there is no active error correction performed. After the state picks up the signal, we measure the code's $\hat{X}$ stabilizers to infer the magnetic field parameter, $\theta$. Given $N$ copies of the probe state, we derive the probability that all stabilizer measurements return $+1$, which depends on $\theta$. The uncertainty in $\theta$ (estimated from these measurements) is bounded by a new quantity, the \textit{Robustness Bound}, which ties the Quantum Fisher Information of the measurement to the number of weight-$2$ codewords of the dual code. Through this novel lens of coding theory, we show that for nontrivial CSS code states the HNLS condition still governs the Heisenberg scaling in our robust metrology setting. Our finding suggests fundamental limitations in the use of linear quantum codes for dephased magnetic field sensing applications both in the near-term robust sensing regime and in the long-term fault tolerant era. We also extend our results to general scenarios beyond dephased magnetic field sensing.</description>

Abstract: Almost all existing hierarchical federated learning (FL) models are limited to two aggregation layers, restricting scalability and flexibility in complex, large-scale networks. In this work, we propose a Multi-Layer Hierarchical Federated Learning framework (QMLHFL), which appears to be the first study that generalizes hierarchical FL to arbitrary numbers of layers and network architectures through nested aggregation, while employing a layer-specific quantization scheme to meet communication constraints. We develop a comprehensive convergence analysis for QMLHFL and derive a general convergence condition and rate that reveal the effects of key factors, including quantization parameters, hierarchical architecture, and intra-layer iteration counts. Furthermore, we determine the optimal number of intra-layer iterations to maximize the convergence rate while meeting a deadline constraint that accounts for both communication and computation times. Our results show that QMLHFL consistently achieves high learning accuracy, even under high data heterogeneity, and delivers notably improved performance when optimized, compared to using randomly selected values.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isoperimetric problem is a classic topic in geometric measure theory, yet critical questions regarding the characterization of optimal solutions -- even asymptotically optimal ones -- remain largely unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric problem on the product Riemannian manifold $M^{n}$ endowed with the product probability measure $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $(M,\nu)$ is a weighted Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Bakry--\'Emery--Ricci curvature. We establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics of the isoperimetric profile, which reveals a precise equivalence between this asymptotic isoperimetric inequality and the nonlinear log-Sobolev inequality. It is observed that conditional typical sets, a fundamental concept from information theory, form an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. This class of subsets further yields an upper bound on the isoperimetric profile in the central limit regime. Although our results are stated for product spaces, they imply certain isoperimetric inequalities for non-product spaces, e.g., they can be used to recover the weaker equivalence established by Ledoux and Bobkov for arbitrary non-product spaces or used to establish quantitative relations among the optimal constants in isoperimetric, concentration and transport inequalities for product or non-product spaces. Our results provide a rigorous justification from the perspective of nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities for why isoperimetric minimizers behave fundamentally differently across spaces with distinct geometric structures. Our proof idea is a new framework which integrates tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Asymptotics of Differentially Private PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy, statistics of a sensitive dataset are privatized by introducing random noise. Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\rightarrow\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our privacy analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with classical contiguity arguments due to Le Cam to obtain sharp high-dimensional privacy characterizations.</description>

      <title>DMA-Aided MU-MISO Systems for Power Splitting SWIPT via Lorentzian-Constrained Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal power splitting and beamforming design for co-located simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) users in Dynamic Metasurface Antenna (DMA)-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Static Energy Efficient Design of Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) by developing a consistent formulation for power distribution in these systems. The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates. Our experimental results depict that dynamic tuning of pinching locations can significantly boost energy efficiency of PASSs.</description>

      <title>Identifying faulty edges in resistive electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a resistive electrical network, we would like to determine whether all the resistances (edges) in the network are working, and if not, identify which edge (or edges) are faulty. To make this determination, we are allowed to measure the effective resistance between certain pairs of nodes (which can be done by measuring the amount of current when one unit of voltage difference is applied at the chosen pair of nodes). The goal is to determine which edge, if any, is not working in the network using the smallest number of measurements. We prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on this optimal number of measurements for different classes of graphs. These bounds are tight for several of these classes showing that our measurement strategies are optimal.</description>

      <title>Winning Criteria for Open Games: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Prefix Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-player games with alternating moves played on infinite trees. Our main focus is on the case where the trees are full (regular) and the winning set is open (with respect to the product topology on the tree). Gale and Stewart showed that in this setting one of the players always has a winning strategy, though it is not known in advance which player. We present simple necessary conditions for the first player to have a winning strategy, and establish an equivalence between winning sets that guarantee a win for the first player and maximal prefix codes. Using this equivalence, we derive a necessary algebraic condition for winning, and exhibit a family of games for which this algebraic condition is in fact equivalent to winning. We introduce the concept of coverings, and show that by covering the tree of the game with an infinite labeled tree corresponding to the free group, we can use "game-theoretic tools" to derive a simple trait of maximal prefix codes.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Circuits using a Two-Step Least Squares Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms are a vital part of quantum computing. It is a blend of quantum and classical methods for tackling tough problems in machine learning, chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. Yet as these algorithms scale up, they cannot escape the barren-plateau phenomenon. As systems grow, gradients can vanish so quickly that training deep or randomly initialized circuits becomes nearly impossible. To overcome the barren plateau problem, we introduce a two-stage optimization framework. First comes the convex initialization stage. Here, we shape the quantum energy landscape, the Hilmaton landscape, into a smooth, low-energy basin. This step makes gradients easier to spot and keeps noise from derailing the process. Once we have gotten a stable gradient flow, we move to the second stage: nonconvex refinement. In this phase, we allow the algorithm to explore different energy minima, thereby making the model more expressive. Finally, we used our two-stage solution to perform quantum cryptanalysis of the quantum key distribution protocol (i.e., BB84) to determine the optimal cloning strategies. The simulation results showed that our proposed two-stage solution outperforms its random initialization counterpart.</description>
