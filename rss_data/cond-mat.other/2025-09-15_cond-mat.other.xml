      <title>Magnonic Combinatorial Memory for High-density Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an urgent need to enhance the storage density of memory devices to accommodate the exponentially increasing amount of data generated by humankind. In this work, we describe Magnonic Combinatorial Memory (MCM), where the bits of information are stored in the signal propagation paths in the network. The number of paths among the elements of the network is much larger compared to the number of elements, which makes it possible to enhance the data storage density compared to conventional memory devices. MCM is an active ring circuit consisting of electric and magnonic parts. The electric part includes a broadband amplifier, phase shifters, and frequency filters. The magnonic part is a mesh of frequency-dependent elements. Signal propagation path(s) in the mesh depend on the amplitude/phase matching between the electric and magnetic parts. The operation of the MCM is described based on the network model, where information is encoded in the S-parameters of the network elements as well as in the element arrangement in the network. We present experimental data for MCM with a four-terminal magnonic element. The element consists of a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet Y3Fe2(FeO4)3 (YIG) film and magnets on top of the film. There are four micro antennas aimed to convert electromagnetic waves into spin waves and vice versa. One of the antennas is used as an input port while the other three are the output ports. Experimental data show the prominent dependence of the element S-parameters on the magnet arrangement. The number of possible arrangements scales factorially with the number of magnets. There is a number of bits that can be encoded into one magnet arrangement. The results demonstrate a robust operation of MCM with an On/Off ratio for path detection exceeding 50 dB at room temperature. Physical limits and practical constraints of MCM are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws for Deep Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws--power-law relationships between generalization errors and characteristics of deep learning models--are vital tools for developing reliable models while managing limited resources. Although the success of large language models highlights the importance of these laws, their application to deep regression models remains largely unexplored. Here, we empirically investigate neural scaling laws in deep regression using a parameter estimation model for twisted van der Waals magnets. We observe power-law relationships between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore, the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details. The consistent scaling behaviors and their large scaling exponents suggest that the performance of deep regression models can improve substantially with increasing data size.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence Paradox on Low-Symmetry Surfaces of Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals offer access to boundary phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Here, we investigate the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. The (103) surface is an example of a low symmetry surface that presents an apparent paradox to the bulk-boundary correspondence. The surface periodicity to which the topological surface states are expected to adhere does not correspond to the bulk periodicity of the Weyl points. By showing that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate replicas that accumulate into a superlattice commensurate with the surface Brillouin zone, we demonstrate how the apparent bulk boundary correspondence paradox is resolved and establish a universal criterion for arbitrary facets. The framework and experimental results further suggests that overlapping Fermi arcs can hybridize into closed Fermi arc loops, enriching boundary topology and enabling unconventional transport, interference, and collective phenomena unique to lowsymmetry facets.</description>

      <title>Solitons with Self-induced Topological Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrodinger equation supports solitons -- self-interacting, localized states that behave as nearly independent objects. We exhibit solitons with self-induced nonreciprocal dynamics in a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This nonreciprocal behavior, dependent on soliton power, arises from the interplay between linear and nonlinear terms in the equations of motion. Initially stable at high power, solitons exhibit nonreciprocal instabilities as power decreases, leading to unidirectional acceleration and amplification. This behavior is topologically protected by winding numbers on the solitons' mean-field Hamiltonian and their stability matrix, linking nonlinear dynamics and point gap topology in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>
