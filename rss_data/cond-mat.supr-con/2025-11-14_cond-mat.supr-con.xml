      <title>Microwave Dressed States and Vacuum Fluctuations in a Superconducting Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.</description>

      <title>The True Parent Phase of K1.9Fe4.2Se5: A Stripe-type Orthorhombic Phase Requiring a Superconducting Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the four-fold Tc amplification in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (&gt;30 K) compared to FeSe (8 K) remains a central puzzle, complicated by a debate over the true superconducting (SC) parent phase--the I4/m (245) insulating matrix or a supposed I4/mmm metallic phase. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel "stripe-type orthorhombic phase" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state. This discovery of a two-step transition--formation of a stripe parent phase, followed by a superconducting distortion--provides a new mechanism for Tc amplification via controlled heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Green Function Invariants for Floquet Topological Superconductivity Induced by Proximity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $\pi$ modes.</description>

      <title>Competition of fermion pairing, magnetism, and charge order in the spin-doped attractive Hubbard gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous missing first Shapiro step in Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of odd-order Shapiro steps is a predicted signature of topological superconductors.Experimentally, the missing first-order Shapiro step has been reported in both putative topological superconducting systems and topologically trivial superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions. Here, we revisit this phenomenon in topologically trivial Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation. The missing first Shapiro step coincides with a sharp voltage jump during superconducting switching, yet reappears when the jump is lowered and softened by increasing microwave power, temperature, or magnetic field. It also reappears at higher microwave frequencies, consistent with qualitative results from an RSJ model incorporating the sharp jump. These observations indicate that the absence of the first Shapiro step, associated with the sharp switching jump, simply results from their location within the measurement blind region. This work identifies a common but overlooked mechanism underlying the missing first Shapiro step, offering new insights into fractional Josephson effect experiments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional flat bands and possible interlayer triplet pairing superconductivity in the alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31{\deg}. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moir\'e bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moir\'e bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moir\'e bulk systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing local Majorana properties using Andreev states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental architectures and remains robust in extended chains.</description>
