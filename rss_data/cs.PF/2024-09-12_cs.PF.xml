      <title>Computational Algorithms for the Product Form Solution of Closed Queuing Networks with Finite Buffers and Skip-Over Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed queuing networks with finite capacity buffers and skip-over policies are fundamental models in the performance evaluation of computer and communication systems. This technical report presents the details of computational algorithms to derive the key performance metrics for such networks. The primary focus is on the efficient computation of the normalization constant, which is critical for determining the steady-state probabilities of the network states under investigation. A convolution algorithm is proposed, which paves the way for the computation of key performance indices, such as queue length distribution and throughput, accommodating the intricacies introduced by finite capacity constraints and skip-over mechanisms. Finally, an extension of the traditional Mean Value Analysis algorithm addressing numerical stability is provided. The approaches discussed here allow make the investigation of large-scale networks feasible and enable the development of robust implementations of these techniques for practical use.</description>

      <title>Microarchitectural comparison and in-core modeling of state-of-the-art CPUs: Grace, Sapphire Rapids, and Genoa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With Nvidia's release of the Grace Superchip, all three big semiconductor companies in HPC (AMD, Intel, Nvidia) are currently competing in the race for the best CPU. In this work we analyze the performance of these state-of-the-art CPUs and create an accurate in-core performance model for their microarchitectures Zen 4, Golden Cove, and Neoverse V2, extending the Open Source Architecture Code Analyzer (OSACA) tool and comparing it with LLVM-MCA. Starting from the peculiarities and up- and downsides of a single core, we extend our comparison by a variety of microbenchmarks and the capabilities of a full node. The "write-allocate (WA) evasion" feature, which can automatically reduce the memory traffic caused by write misses, receives special attention; we show that the Grace Superchip has a next-to-optimal implementation of WA evasion, and that the only way to avoid write allocates on Zen 4 is the explicit use of non-temporal stores.</description>

      <title>Repr Types: One Abstraction to Rule Them All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The choice of how to represent an abstract type can have a major impact on the performance of a program, yet mainstream compilers cannot perform optimizations at such a high level. When dealing with optimizations of data type representations, an important feature is having extensible representation-flexible data types; the ability for a programmer to add new abstract types and operations, as well as concrete implementations of these, without modifying the compiler or a previously defined library. Many research projects support high-level optimizations through static analysis, instrumentation, or benchmarking, but they are all restricted in at least one aspect of extensibility.
  This paper presents a new approach to representation-flexible data types without such restrictions and which still finds efficient optimizations. Our approach centers around a single built-in type $\texttt{repr}$ and function overloading with cost annotations for operation implementations. We evaluate our approach (i) by defining a universal collection type as a library, a single type for all conventional collections, and (ii) by designing and implementing a representation-flexible graph library. Programs using $\texttt{repr}$ types are typically faster than programs with idiomatic representation choices -- sometimes dramatically so -- as long as the compiler finds good implementations for all operations. Our compiler performs the analysis efficiently by finding optimized solutions quickly and by reusing previous results to avoid recomputations.</description>

      <title>Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge encourages community approaches to developing new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data derived from social media, sensor feeds, and scientific data to discover relationships between events as they unfold in the field. The anonymized network sensing Graph Challenge seeks to enable large, open, community-based approaches to protecting networks. Many large-scale networking problems can only be solved with community access to very broad data sets with the highest regard for privacy and strong community buy-in. Such approaches often require community-based data sharing. In the broader networking community (commercial, federal, and academia) anonymized source-to-destination traffic matrices with standard data sharing agreements have emerged as a data product that can meet many of these requirements. This challenge provides an opportunity to highlight novel approaches for optimizing the construction and analysis of anonymized traffic matrices using over 100 billion network packets derived from the largest Internet telescope in the world (CAIDA). This challenge specifies the anonymization, construction, and analysis of these traffic matrices. A GraphBLAS reference implementation is provided, but the use of GraphBLAS is not required in this Graph Challenge. As with prior Graph Challenges the goal is to provide a well-defined context for demonstrating innovation. Graph Challenge participants are free to select (with accompanying explanation) the Graph Challenge elements that are appropriate for highlighting their innovations.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</description>
