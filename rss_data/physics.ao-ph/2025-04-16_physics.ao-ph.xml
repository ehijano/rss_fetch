      <title>PALACE v1.0: Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Below about 2.3 $\mu$m, the nighttime emission of the Earth's atmosphere is dominated by non-thermal radiation from the mesosphere and thermosphere. As this airglow can even outshine scattered moonlight in the near-infrared regime, the understanding of the Earth's night-sky brightness requires good knowledge of the complex airglow emission spectrum and its variability. As airglow modelling is very challenging, the comprehensive characterisation of airglow emission requires large data sets of empirical data. For fixed locations, this can be best achieved by archived spectra of large astronomical telescopes with a wide wavelength coverage, high spectral resolving power, and good temporal sampling. Using 10 years of data from the X-shooter echelle spectrograph in the wavelength range from 0.3 to 2.5 $\mu$m and additional data from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile, we have succeeded to build a comprehensive spectroscopic airglow model for this low-latitude site under consideration of theoretical data from the HITRAN database for molecules and from different sources for atoms. The Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission (PALACE) model comprises 9 chemical species, 26,541 emission lines, and 3 unresolved continuum components. Moreover, there are climatologies of relative intensity, solar cycle effect, and residual variability with respect to local time and day of year for 23 variability classes. Spectra can be calculated with a stand-alone code for different conditions, also including optional atmospheric absorption and scattering. In comparison to the observed X-shooter spectra, PALACE shows convincing agreement and is significantly better than the previous, widely used airglow model for Cerro Paranal.</description>

      <title>Visual anemometry of natural vegetation from their leaf motion</title>

Abstract: High-resolution, near-ground wind-speed data are critical for improving the accuracy of weather predictions and climate models,$^{1-3}$ supporting wildfire control efforts,$^{4-7}$ and ensuring the safe passage of airplanes during takeoff and landing maneouvers.$^{8,9}$ Quantitative wind speed anemometry generally employs on-site instrumentation for accurate single-position data or sophisticated remote techniques such as Doppler radar for quantitative field measurements. It is widely recognized that the wind-induced motion of vegetation depends in a complex manner on their structure and mechanical properties, obviating their use in quantitative anemometry.$^{10-14}$ We analyze measurements on a host of different vegetation showing that leaf motion can be decoupled from the leaf's branch and support structure, at low-to-moderate wind speed, $U_{wind}$. This wind speed range is characterized by a leaf Reynolds number, enabling the development of a remote, quantitative anemometry method based on the formula, $U_{wind}\approx740\sqrt{{\mu}U_{leaf}/{\rho}D}$, that relies only on the leaf size $D$, its measured fluctuating (RMS) speed $U_{leaf}$, the air viscosity $\mu$, and its mass density $\rho$. This formula is corroborated by a first-principles model and validated using a host of laboratory and field tests on diverse vegetation types, ranging from oak, olive, and magnolia trees through to camphor and bullgrass. The findings of this study open the door to a new paradigm in anemometry, using natural vegetation to enable remote and rapid quantitative field measurements at global locations with minimal cost.</description>

      <title>Cascades transition in generalised two-dimensional turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalised two-dimensional (2D) fluid dynamics is characterised by a relationship between a scalar field $q$, called generalised vorticity, and the stream function $\psi$, namely $q = (-\nabla^2)^\frac{\alpha}{2} \psi$. We study the transition of cascades in generalised 2D turbulence by systematically varying the parameter $\alpha$ and investigating its influential role in determining the directionality (inverse, forward, or bidirectional) of these cascades. We derive upper bounds for the dimensionless dissipation rates of generalised energy $E_G$ and enstrophy $\Omega_G$ as the Reynolds number tends to infinity. These findings corroborate numerical simulations, illustrating the inverse cascade of $E_G$ and forward cascade of $\Omega_G$ for $\alpha &gt; 0$, contrasting with the reverse behaviour for $\alpha &lt; 0$. The dependence of dissipation rates on system parameters reinforces these observed transitions, substantiated by spectral fluxes and energy spectra, which hint at Kolmogorov-like scalings at large scales but discrepancies at smaller scales between numerical and theoretical estimates. These discrepancies are possibly due to nonlocal transfers, which dominate the dynamics as we go from positive to negative values of $\alpha$. Intriguingly, the forward cascade of $E_G$ for $\alpha &lt; 0$ reveals similarities to three-dimensional turbulence, notably the emergence of vortex filaments within a 2D framework, marking a unique feature of this generalised model.</description>

      <title>Accelerate Coastal Ocean Circulation Model with AI Surrogate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly 900 million people live in low-lying coastal zones around the world and bear the brunt of impacts from more frequent and severe hurricanes and storm surges. Oceanographers simulate ocean current circulation along the coasts to develop early warning systems that save lives and prevent loss and damage to property from coastal hazards. Traditionally, such simulations are conducted using coastal ocean circulation models such as the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), which usually runs on an HPC cluster with multiple CPU cores. However, the process is time-consuming and energy expensive. While coarse-grained ROMS simulations offer faster alternatives, they sacrifice detail and accuracy, particularly in complex coastal environments. Recent advances in deep learning and GPU architecture have enabled the development of faster AI (neural network) surrogates. This paper introduces an AI surrogate based on a 4D Swin Transformer to simulate coastal tidal wave propagation in an estuary for both hindcast and forecast (up to 12 days). Our approach not only accelerates simulations but also incorporates a physics-based constraint to detect and correct inaccurate results, ensuring reliability while minimizing manual intervention. We develop a fully GPU-accelerated workflow, optimizing the model training and inference pipeline on NVIDIA DGX-2 A100 GPUs. Our experiments demonstrate that our AI surrogate reduces the time cost of 12-day forecasting of traditional ROMS simulations from 9,908 seconds (on 512 CPU cores) to 22 seconds (on one A100 GPU), achieving over 450$\times$ speedup while maintaining high-quality simulation results. This work contributes to oceanographic modeling by offering a fast, accurate, and physically consistent alternative to traditional simulation models, particularly for real-time forecasting in rapid disaster response.</description>

      <title>Air Quality Prediction with Physics-Guided Dual Neural ODEs in Open Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air pollution significantly threatens human health and ecosystems, necessitating effective air quality prediction to inform public policy. Traditional approaches are generally categorized into physics-based and data-driven models. Physics-based models usually struggle with high computational demands and closed-system assumptions, while data-driven models may overlook essential physical dynamics, confusing the capturing of spatiotemporal correlations. Although some physics-guided approaches combine the strengths of both models, they often face a mismatch between explicit physical equations and implicit learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose Air-DualODE, a novel physics-guided approach that integrates dual branches of Neural ODEs for air quality prediction. The first branch applies open-system physical equations to capture spatiotemporal dependencies for learning physics dynamics, while the second branch identifies the dependencies not addressed by the first in a fully data-driven way. These dual representations are temporally aligned and fused to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that Air-DualODE achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting pollutant concentrations across various spatial scales, thereby offering a promising solution for real-world air quality challenges.</description>

      <title>Characterization of local energy transfer in large-scale intermittent stratified turbulent flows via coarse graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies based on simulations of the Boussinesq equations indicate that stratified turbulent flows can develop large-scale intermittency in the velocity and temperature fields, as detected in the atmosphere and oceans. In particular, emerging powerful vertical drafts were found to generate local turbulence, proving necessary for stratified flows to dissipate the energy as efficiently as homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. The existence of regions characterized by enhanced turbulence and dissipation, as observed, for instance, in the ocean, requires appropriate tools to assess how energy is transferred across the scales and at the same time locally in the physical space. After refining a classical space-filtering procedure, here we investigate the feedback of extreme vertical velocity drafts on energy transfer and exchanges in subdomains of simulations of stably stratified flows of geophysical interest. Our analysis shows that vertical drafts are indeed able to trigger upscale and downscale energy transfers, strengthening the coupling between kinetic and potential energies at certain scales, depending on the intensity of the local vertical velocity.</description>
