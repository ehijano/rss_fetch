      <title>Wavy synchronization in locomotion of train millipedes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization was observed in various biological systems such as flashing of fireflies and chorus of frogs. In this study, we report wavy synchronization in the locomotion of train millepedes (Parafontaria laminata armigera) and examine its mechanism on the basis of a phase oscillator model. First, we performed behavioral experiments and observed wavy synchronization in the millipedes with a wave number of approximately 3. Second, we proposed a phase oscillator model with two kinds of phase shift parameters and estimated suitable parameter values from the empirical data of an order parameter. Consequently, we succeeded in quantitatively explaining the wavy synchronization of walking millepedes when assuming asymmetric phase shift parameters in the proposed model. Given the sophisticated walking behavior of the train millepedes, this study contributes to further understanding of the mechanism in biological locomotion.</description>

      <title>Oscillator Chain Model for Multi-Contour Systems With Priority in Conflict Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel model of oscillatory chains that generalizes the contour discrete model of Buslaev nets. The model offers a continuous description of conflicts in system dynamics, interpreted as interactions between neighboring oscillators when their phases lie within defined interaction sectors. The size of the interaction sector can be seen as a measure of vehicle density within clusters moving along contours. The model assumes that oscillators can synchronize their dynamics, using concepts inherited from the Kuramoto model, which effectively accounts for the discrete state effects observed in Buslaev nets. The governing equation for oscillator dynamics incorporates four key factors: deceleration caused by conflicts with neighboring oscillators and the synchronization process, which induces additional acceleration or deceleration. Numerical analysis shows that the system exhibits both familiar properties from classic Buslaev nets, such as metastable synchronization, and novel behaviors, including phase transitions as the interaction sector size changes.</description>

      <title>Three strongly coupled Kerr parametric oscillators forming a Boltzmann machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are a promising resource for classical and quantum analog computation, for example to find the ground state of Ising Hamiltonians. Yet, the state space of strongly coupled KPO networks is very involved. As such, their phase diagram sometimes features either too few or too many states, including some that cannot be mapped to Ising spin configurations. This complexity makes it challenging to find and meet the conditions under which an analog optimization algorithm can be successful. Here, we demonstrate how to use three strongly coupled KPOs as a simulator for an Ising Hamiltonian, and estimate its ground state using a Boltzmann sampling measurement. While fully classical, our work is directly relevant for quantum systems operating on coherent states.</description>

      <title>Capturing AI's Attention: Physics of Repetition, Hallucination, Bias and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a first-principles physics theory of the AI engine at the heart of LLMs' 'magic' (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude): the basic Attention head. The theory allows a quantitative analysis of outstanding AI challenges such as output repetition, hallucination and harmful content, and bias (e.g. from training and fine-tuning). Its predictions are consistent with large-scale LLM outputs. Its 2-body form suggests why LLMs work so well, but hints that a generalized 3-body Attention would make such AI work even better. Its similarity to a spin-bath means that existing Physics expertise could immediately be harnessed to help Society ensure AI is trustworthy and resilient to manipulation.</description>

      <title>Discovering dynamical laws for speech gestures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the cognitive sciences is discovering the dynamics that govern behaviour. Take the example of spoken language, which is characterised by a highly variable and complex set of physical movements that map onto the small set of cognitive units that comprise language. What are the fundamental dynamical principles behind the movements that structure speech production? In this study, we discover models in the form of symbolic equations that govern articulatory gestures during speech. A sparse symbolic regression algorithm is used to discover models from kinematic data on the tongue and lips. We explore these candidate models using analytical techniques and numerical simulations, and find that a second-order linear model achieves high levels of accuracy, but a nonlinear force is required to properly model articulatory dynamics in approximately one third of cases. This supports the proposal that an autonomous, nonlinear, second-order differential equation is a viable dynamical law for articulatory gestures in speech. We conclude by identifying future opportunities and obstacles in data-driven model discovery and outline prospects for discovering the dynamical principles that govern language, brain and behaviour.</description>

      <title>Manipulating phases in many-body interacting systems with subsystem resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing thermodynamically unstable phases in many-body systems -- such as suppressing pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson's disease or maintaining magnetic order across broad temperature ranges -- remains a persistent challenge. In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative -- subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations.</description>

      <title>L{\'e}vy-noise-induced wavefront propagation for bistable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of the L{\'e}vy noise's properties on wavefront propagation is analyzed on examples of ensembles of locally coupled bistable oscillators and a single bistable delayed-feedback oscillator considered as a spatially-extended system evolving in quasi-space. It is shown that additive L{\'e}vy noise allows to induce wavefront propagation in ensembles of symmetric bistable oscillators. In such a case, the direction and velocity of the noise-sustained propagation is determined both by the noise's skewness parameter and by the coupling topology (bidirectional and unidirectional coupling schemes are distinguished). In addition, additive L{\'e}vy noise induces wavefront propagation in a bistable delayed-feedback oscillator assumed to be symmetric such that its dynamics replicates the collective behaviour in the ensemble with unidirectional coupling. The wavefront propagation velocity used in this analysis is shown to be varied when adjusting the noise parameters. The revealed effects are demonstrated in the ensembles by using numerical simulation, whereas the numerical exploration of the delayed-feedback oscillator is complemented by physical experiments, showing a good correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</description>

      <title>Power Law Behavior of Center-Like Decaying Oscillation : Exponent through Perturbation Theory and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems theory, there is a lack of a straightforward rule to distinguish exact center solutions from decaying center-like solutions, as both require the damping force function to be zero [1, 2]. By adopting a multi-scale perturbative method, we have demonstrated a general rule for the decaying center-like power law behavior, characterized by an exponent of 1/3 . The investigation began with a physical question about the higher-order nonlinearity in a damping force function, which exhibits birhythmic and trirhythmic behavior under a transition to a decaying center-type solution. Using numerical optimization algorithms, we identified the power law exponent for decaying center-type behavior across various rhythmic conditions. For all scenarios, we consistently observed a decaying power law with an exponent of 1/3 .Our study aims to elucidate their dynamical differences, contributing to theoretical insights and practical applications where distinguishing between different types of center-like behaviour is crucial. This key result would be beneficial for studying the multi-rhythmic nature of biological and engineering systems.</description>
