      <title>Testing a New Star Formation History Model from Principal Component Analysis to Facilitate Spectral Synthesis Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of a galaxy is a complicated convolution of many properties of the galaxy, such as the star formation history (SFH), initial mass function, and metallicity. Inferring galaxy properties from the observed spectrum via spectral synthesis modeling is thus challenging. In particular, a simple yet flexible model for the SFH is required to obtain unbiased inferences. In this paper, we use SFHs from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations to test SFH models in their capabilities of describing the simulated SFHs and the spectra generated from them. In addition to some commonly used SFH models ($\Gamma$, $\tau$, and non-parametric), we also examine a model developed from the principal component analysis (PCA) trained by a set of SFHs from IllustrisTNG. We find that when using the first 5 principal components (eigen-histories), the PCA-based model can achieve a good balance between simplicity and accuracy. Among all the SFH models, the PCA-based model is the best in matching the simulated SFHs. To accurately reproduce the spectra generated from the simulated SFHs, it is necessary to have a degree of freedom to describe the most recent SFH (e.g., a step function covering the age of 0 - 0.3 Gyr). Overall, the PCA+step model performs the best in covering the diversity of SFHs and in reproducing the input spectra, thus providing a reliable SFH model for spectral synthesis modeling.</description>

      <title>Formation of filaments and feathers in disc galaxies: Is self-gravity enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Dense filaments/feathers are kpc-scale dusty features present in nearby main sequence galaxies. Distinct from the spiral arms, filaments constitute a major portion of dense gas concentration. They are expected to play an important role in star formation and are known to harbour star-forming regions and H II regions.
  Aims. We explore the origin of filaments/feathers in disc galaxies via global gravitational instability.
  Methods. We conduct a parameter study using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies that are isothermal, self-gravitating and initialised in equilibrium. Our galaxies are uniquely characterised by two dimensionless parameters, the Toomre $Q$ and the rotational Mach number, $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c} = v_{\rm c}/c_{\rm s}$ (ratio of circular velocity to sound speed). We carry out simulations covering a wide range in both.
  Results. We find that galaxies with $Q = 1$ form filaments within a single rotation, while galaxies with $Q \geq 2$ do not. These filaments are kpc long and are semi-regularly spaced along the azimuth. Their morphology, density contrast and formation timescale vary with $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c}$, with filament spacing and instability onset time both inversely proportional to $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c}$ and the density contrast increasing with $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c}$. However, their growth rates in all $Q = 1$ galaxies are $\sim 0.5~\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the angular frequency. We compare the filament spacing in our simulations with the ones from JWST/MIRI and HST observations of nearby galaxies and find them in agreement.
  Conclusions. Our study suggests that self-gravity and rotation are sufficient to form filaments, even in the absence of spiral arms or magnetic fields. Their morphologies are primarily determined by $\mathcal{M}_{\rm c}$, which parametrises the importance of thermal versus rotational support.</description>

      <title>BAL Outflows are common in Low Eddington Ratio AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars exhibit significant outflows, offering insights into active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. While typically associated with high Eddington ratios, BAL quasars also occur in low Eddington ratio regimes, which remain poorly understood. This study aims to compare BAL properties and variability across these regimes.We investigate the occurrence rates, absorption characteristics, and variability of BAL quasars at low and high Eddington ratios. Using the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog, we selected a redshift-matched control sample to compare low and high Eddington ratio BAL quasar sources. We first examined the BAL fraction as a function of Eddington ratio. Key absorption parameters-equivalent width, absorption line width, velocity range, and depth-were analyzed, and a multi-epoch variability study was conducted using repeat spectra, followed by a comparison of parameter distributions between the two samples. For the first time, we report an increase in BAL fraction toward low Eddington ratios, in addition to the previously known trend of high BAL fraction at high Eddington ratios. While high Eddington sources show extreme absorption features, overall distributions are statistically similar except for maximum outflow velocity. No significant variability differences were observed. The correlation between outflow velocity, Eddington ratio, and luminosity supports the role of radiation pressure in driving quasar outflows. For low Eddington ratios, additional mechanisms, such as softer SEDs, larger outflow distances, and thickened accretion disks from radiatively inefficient processes, likely drive outflow formation.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOGEE Survey VII: First detailed chemical analysis of NGC 6316</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS), high-resolution, high Signal-to-Noise Ratio Near-Infrared spectroscopy, we aim to conduct the most robust chemical study to date for NGC 6316, deriving abundances for a number of elements with a variety of nucleosynthetic origins, most of which have never been studied before in this cluster. We use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accuracy Spectra (BACCHUS) with atmospheric parameters photometrically obtained in order to determine, for the first time, abundances for C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Ce for this cluster. We obtained a mean metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.87 +- 0.02, finding no indication of an intrinsic metallicity spread. Our metallicity agrees with the most recent values from other studies, revising earlier values that were ~0.5 dex metal-richer. With this new value, this cluster, long believed to be a member of the classical metal-rich group of bulge GCs around -0.5, now falls in the dominant bulge globular cluster peak around [Fe/H] = -1. The cluster presents a clear C-N anticorrelation. We also found a [{\alpha}/Fe] = 0.3 +- 0.02. Our abundances show similar behaviour to other in situ globular clusters with comparable metallicity. We obtained E(B-V) = 0.71 and (M-m)_0 = 15.32 +- 0.05 by isochrone fitting, in good agreement with the recent determinations from other works. We derive an overall metallicity [M/H] = -0.6 +- 0.05 by isochrone fitting, in agreement with our abundance determination. According to the mean [Mg/Fe] and [Al/Fe] abundances from first population stars, NGC 6316 is an in-situ globular cluster, in accordance with various dynamical classifications.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Simulations of Ly$\alpha$ Intensity Mapping During Cosmic Reionization Including Sources from Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) intensity maps that include Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and all significant sources of Ly$\alpha$ photons. The sources considered include Ly$\alpha$ directly from galaxies, cooling at the edges of ionized bubbles, recombinations within these bubbles, and reprocessing of galaxy continuum emission in the IGM. We also vary astrophysical parameters including the average neutral fraction of the IGM, the dust absorption of Ly$\alpha$ in galaxies, and the ionizing escape fraction. Previous work has suggested that Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping can be used to constrain the neutral fraction of the IGM when accounting for radiative transfer in the IGM. When radiative transfer is ignored, direct Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies has the highest amplitude of power on all scales. When we include radiative transfer in our simulations, we find continuum emission reprocessed as Ly$\alpha$ is comparable to the Ly$\alpha$ emission directly from galaxies. For high neutral fraction in the IGM, emission from recombinations is comparable to galaxies on large scales. We find that the slope of the power spectrum is sensitive to the neutral fraction of the IGM when radiative transfer is included, suggesting that this may be useful for placing constraints on cosmic reionization. In addition, we find the power of galaxies is decreased across all scales due to dust absorption. We also find the escape fraction must be large for recombinations and bubble edges to contribute significantly to the power. We find the cross power is observable between SPHEREx and a hypothetical galaxy survey with a total signal-to-noise of 4 from $k = 0.035$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to $k = 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Rise of the Milky Way Disk through EMP Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a chemo-dynamical study conducted with 2dF$+$AAOmega of $\sim 6000$ Gaia DR3 non-variable candidate metal-poor stars that lie in the direction of the Galactic plane. Our spectral analysis reveals 15 new extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, with the lowest metallicity at $\rm{[Fe/H]} = -4.0 \pm 0.2$ dex. Two of the EMP stars are also carbon enhanced, with the largest enhancement of $\rm{[C/Fe]} = 1.3 \pm 0.1$ occurring in a dwarf. Using our $\rm{[C/Fe]}$ results, we demonstrate that the number of carbon-depleted stars decreases with lower metallicities, and the fraction of carbon-enhanced stars increases, in agreement with previous studies.
  Our dynamical analysis reveals that the fraction of prograde and retrograde disk stars, defined as $z_{\rm max} &lt; 3$ kpc, with $J_{\phi}/J_{\rm tot} &gt; 0.75$ and $J_{\phi}/J_{\rm tot} &lt; -0.75$ respectively, changes as metallicities decrease. Disk stars on retrograde orbits make up $\sim 10$% of all the stars in our sample with metallicities below $-2.1$ dex. Interestingly, the portion of retrograde disk stars compared with the number of kinematically classified halo stars is approximately constant at $4.6$% for all metallicities below $-1.5$ dex. We also see that $J_{\phi}$ increases from $380 \pm 50$ to $1320 \pm 90$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc across metallicity range $-1.5$ to $-1.1$, consistent with the spin-up of the Galactic disk. Over the metallicity range $-3.0 &lt; \rm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -2.0$, the slopes of the metallicity distribution functions for the prograde and retrograde disk stars are similar and comparable to that for the halo population. Detailed chemical analyses on high resolution spectra are needed to distinguish the different contributions. Finally, we show that our spectroscopic parameters reveal serious systematics in the metallicities published in recent studies that apply various machine learning techniques to Gaia XP spectra.</description>

      <title>Amplification of turbulence through multiple planar shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the amplification of isotropic, incompressible turbulence through multiple planar, collisional shocks, using analytical linear theory. There are two limiting cases we explore. The first assumes shocks occur rapidly in time such that the turbulence does not evolve between shocks. Whereas the second case allows enough time for turbulence to isotropize between each shock. For the latter case, through a quasi-equation-of-state, we show that the weak multi-shock limit is agnostic to the distinction between thermal and vortical turbulent pressures, like an isotropic volumetric compression. When turbulence does not return to isotropy between shocks, the generated anisotropy -- itself a function of shock strength -- can feedback on amplification by further shocks, altering choices for maximal or minimal amplification. In addition for this case, we find that amplification is sensitive to the shock ordering. We map how choices of shock strength can impact these amplification differences due to ordering, finding, for example, shock pairs which lead to identical mean post-shock fields (density, temperature, pressure) but maximally distinct turbulent amplification.</description>

      <title>The Detection Rate of Associated \mgii\ Absorption Lines in Quasars Depends on Their Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active galactic nuclei, jet-driven feedback plays a significant role in influencing the properties of gas within their host galaxy and the circumgalactic medium. By combining observations from the Very Large Array Sky Survey, the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm, the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we assembled a sample of 3,141 radio-loud quasars, among which 418 exhibit \mgii\ associated absorption lines in their Sloan spectra. We classify these quasars into evolutionary stages based on their radio spectral shapes. Our analysis reveals that evolved quasars exhibit a significantly higher incidence of \mgii\ associated absorption lines compared to younger sources, particularly among quasars with ``non-peaked'' radio spectra, which show an incidence of \mgii\ associated absorbers approximately 1.7 times greater than that of gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. This observation can be explained effectively by jet-driven feedback. As quasars age, their jets expand and expel substantial amounts of gas from small scales to larger scales, ultimately reaching the circumgalactic medium. The gas expelled from the inner regions and distributed over larger scales results in a greater coverage fraction of absorbing gas. Consequently, evolved quasars exhibit a higher incidence of \mgii\ absorption lines.</description>

      <title>Central Velocity Dispersion being the Primary Driver of Abundance Patterns in Quenched Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The element abundances of galaxies provide crucial insights into their formation and evolution. Using high-resolution IFU data from the MaNGA survey, we analyze the central spectra (0-0.5 $R_{\rm e}$) of 1,185 quenched galaxies ($z = 0.012-0.15$) to study their element abundances and stellar populations. We employ the full-spectrum fitting code {\tt alf} to derive stellar ages and element abundances from synthetic spectra and empirical libraries. Our key findings are: (1) Central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_*$) is the most effective parameter correlating with (relative) element abundances, especially [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe], and [N/Fe], outperforming $M_\ast$ and $M_\ast/R_{\rm e}$. (2) When binned by $\sigma_*$, the relative abundances of Na, Mg, C, and N remain stable across different formation times ($T_{\rm form}$), suggesting these elements are primarily influenced by the burstiness of star formation (traced by $\sigma_*$) rather than prolonged evolutionary processes. (3) Fe and Ca show little variation with $\sigma_*$, indicating weaker sensitivity to $\sigma_*$-driven processes. However, $T_{\rm form}$ has a global influence on all elements, contributing to their overall chemical evolution, albeit secondary to $\sigma_*$ for most elements. These results support the primary role of $\sigma_*$ in shaping the abundance patterns, likely stemming from the connection between central massive black holes and possibly dark matter halos, which influences the burstiness of star formation histories.</description>

      <title>Simulations for the evolution of the chemical clock HC3N/N2H+ in high-mass star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From observations, column density ratios or integrated intensity ratios between some species exhibit monotonic increase or decrease along with the evolution of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs). Such ratios are defined as chemical clocks, which can be used to constrain the evolutionary stage. We performed chemical simulations to reproduce the observed column density ratio of HC3N/N2H+ and the abundances of these two species across various evolutionary stages in HMSFRs. Simultaneously, we identified the chemical processes responsible for the observed time-dependent trends in these stages. Our simulations utilized the astrochemical code Nautilus and the existing 1D models of HMSFRs that cover four evolutionary stages, accompanied by variations in density and temperature throughout the entire evolution. When averaging over large spatial scales, the best model produced successfully matches the observed column density ratio of HC3N/N2H+ and the abundances of the species involved at specific times for each evolutionary stage; that is, the late high-mass starless core stage, the early high-mass protostellar object stage, and the early ultracompact HII stage. HC3N is mainly affected by the warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) and its own thermal desorption, while N2H+ is primarily influenced by the thermal desorption of N2, CO, CH4, NH3, and H2O followed by dissociative recombination and ion-molecule reactions. The results obtained from the best-fitting model timescales broadly agree with statistical estimates. Based on our best-fit model, we further examined other 350 ratios involving 27 species, and 178 ratios exhibit an increasing or decreasing evolutionary trend around the best-fit timescales of HC3N/N2H+. Among them, 157 ratios are observable and could be considered as candidate chemical clocks.</description>

      <title>Galactic-scale emission-line outflow from the radio-loud quasar 3C 191</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasar feedback is routinely invoked as an indispensable ingredient in galaxy formation models. Galactic outflows are a crucial agent of quasar feedback that frequently manifest themselves in absorption and emission lines. Measuring the size and energetics of outflows based on absorption lines remains a challenge, and integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) mapping in emission lines is complementary. We present a VLT/SINFONI IFS mapping of quasar 3C 191 at $z \sim 2$, in which the outflow has been analyzed in absorption line spectroscopy. Three components are found based on the morphology and kinetics of [OIII]-emitting gas: a unshifted component which consistent with the systemic redshift and the location of the nucleus, a blueshifted in the north, and a redshifted in the south. The latter two components have velocities $\sim$ 600 km s$^{-1}$ and projected extents of 5 and 11 kpc, respectively, suggesting a biconical outflow structure. The blueshifted component's velocity is consistent with that derived from absorption lines. Using the electron density measured by the absorption lines and the luminosity and velocity of [OIII] outflow, we derive the mass outflow rate to be $\dot{M} \sim $ 9.5-13.4 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity $\dot{E}_{\rm kin}$ ~ 2.5-3.7 $\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with absorption line analyses with VLT/Xshooter spectrum. The kinetic luminosity is only 0.01% of the bolometric luminosity, rendering a relatively weak outflow compared to typical expectation for effective feedback.</description>

      <title>The distance of quasar outflows from the central source: The first consistent values from emission and absorption determinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the distance of quasar outflows from the central source ($R$) is essential for determining their importance for AGN feedback. There are two methods to measure $R$: 1) A direct determination using spatially resolved Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) of the outflow in emission. 2) An indirect method which uses the absorption troughs from ionic excited states. The column density ratio between the excited and resonance states yields the outflow number density. Combined with a knowledge of the outflow's ionization parameter, $R$ can be determined. Generally, the IFS method probes $R$ range of several kpc or more, while the absorption method usually yields $R$ values of less than 1 kpc. There is no inconsistency between the two methods as the determinations come from different objects. Here we report the results of applying both methods to the same quasar outflow, where we derive consistent determinations of $R$ $\approx$ 5 kpc. This is the first time where the indirect absorption $R$ determination is verified by a direct spatially resolved IFS observation. In addition, the velocities (and energetics) from the IFS and absorption data are also found to be consistent. Therefore, these are two manifestations of the same outflow. In this paper we concentrate on the absorption $R$ determination for the outflow seen in quasar 3C 191 using VLT/X-shooter observations. We also reanalyze an older absorption determination for the outflow based on Keck/HIRES data and find that revised measurement to be consistent with ours. Our companion paper details the IFS analysis of the same object.</description>

      <title>Spectroastrometry and Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei. II. Measuring Geometric Distances and Black Hole Masses of Four Nearby Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric distances of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are challenging to measure because of their exceptionally compact structure yet vast cosmic distances. A combination of spectroastrometry and reverberation mapping (SARM) of broad-line regions (BLRs) constitutes a novel means to probe the geometric distance of AGNs, which has recently become practically feasible owing to successful interferometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here, we perform SARM analysis of four nearby quasars: Mrk 509, PDS 456, 3C 273, and NGC 3783. Results for the former two are reported for the first time and the latter two are revisited using our improved BLR dynamical modeling that includes the radial-dependent responsivity of BLRs. This allows us to self-consistently account for the emissivity weighting of the BLR in spectroastrometry and responsivity weighting in reverberation mapping. We obtain angular-diameter distances of the four quasars, from which we derive a Hubble constant of $H_0=69_{-10}^{+12}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. Although this consititutes a large uncertainty for a measurement of $H_0$, it is anticipated that the precision will improve to a competitive level once a greater number of AGNs are accessible following the upgrade of GRAVITY in the near future. From SARM analysis, the black hole masses of the four quasars are also measured with the statistical uncertainty ranging from 0.06 to 0.23 dex, consistent with the correlations between black hole masses and properties of the host bulges.</description>

      <title>Characterization of interstellar carbon dust analogues synthesized by dielectric barrier discharge and evolution after irradiation with 3 MeV H+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Fluffy" hydrogenated amorphouscarbon(a-C:H)wassynthesizedusingadielectric barrier discharge plasma, driven by nanosec ond high voltage pulses at 1 kHz frequency in a helium-butane mixture. The a-C:H samples were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, laser-assisted and secondary ion mass spectrometry, and Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. We find that a-C:H samples exhibit infrared absorption features in good agreement with those observed for carbonaceous dust in IRAS 08572+3915 galaxy. We discuss their nano to microscale structure and derive their hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratios from the results obtained by three distinct experimental characterization techniques. Relying on the average H/C value determined by mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy, we can then constrain the absorption strengths values to those best corresponding to our dust analogue, and calculate the H/C ratio from the infrared spectra. Altogether, we find that our dust analogue consists of a dominant hydrogen-rich aliphatic network, with small, isolated, aromatic regions. The a-C:H dust analogue was then irradiated with 3 MeV H+ and subsequently analyzed ex situ. Morphological and chemical changes, including the evolution of H/C, CH2/CH3, and sp2/sp3 ratios, were observed with increasing proton fluence, indicating dehydrogenation and graphitization. Proton bombardment shifted the initial location of a-C:H in the hydrocarbon ternary phase diagram toward the central region defined by IRAS 08572+3915 observations. The decay of the 3.4 {\mu}m band with proton fluence was used to calculate CH destruction cross-sections, results consistent with a direct effect of cosmic rays on the disappearance of the 3.4 {\mu}m band.</description>

      <title>X-ray and CO-Derived Column Densities in AGN: A Study of Obscuration Properties in CTAGN and Non-CTAGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides insights into the material surrounding the central engine. Compton-thick AGN (CTAGN), characterized by a column density of $N_{\mathrm{H}} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, are heavily obscured by dust and gas. While X-ray observations primarily determine this column density, the sub-mm obscuration properties of CTAGN remain less explored. We analyze archival ALMA CO(3-2) data for CTAGN and non-CTAGN from the 70-month $\textit{Swift}$/BAT catalog and other X-ray surveys. Integrated intensity maps (moment 0) reveal dense gas concentrated around the nucleus. Assuming a constant CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor, $X_{\mathrm{CO}} = 2.2 \times 10^{20} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \ (\mathrm{K\ km\ s}^{-1})^{-1}$, we find that molecular hydrogen column densities ($N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$) are generally lower than X-ray-derived total hydrogen column densities ($N_{\mathrm{H}}$). However, $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ values in this work are slightly higher than in previous studies due to the adopted conversion factor. The discrepancy between $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ aligns with prior findings that X-ray-derived values tend to be higher, except for non-CTAGN, where $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ can exceed $N_{\mathrm{H}}$. Kendall and Spearman tests indicate a positive monotonic correlation, though not statistically significant, suggesting a complex interplay of factors. The optically thick nature of CO in dense regions may contribute to the observed differences. Our results highlight the need for an accurate CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor in deriving column densities, potentially offering an alternative method for identifying CTAGN. Future studies with larger datasets and refined methodologies are essential for a deeper understanding of sub-mm and X-ray properties in AGN.</description>

      <title>The JWST/PASSAGE Survey: Testing Reionization Histories with JWST's First Unbiased Survey for Lyman alpha Emitters at Redshifts 7.5-9.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission is one of few observable features of galaxies that can trace the neutral hydrogen content in the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To accomplish this we need an efficient way to survey for Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at redshifts beyond 7, requiring unbiased emission-line observations that are both sufficiently deep and wide to cover enough volume to detect them. Here we present results from PASSAGE -- a pure-parallel JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopic survey to detect Ly$\alpha$ emitters deep into the EoR, without the bias of photometric preselection. We identify four LAEs at $7.5\leq z\leq9.5$ in four surveyed pointings, and estimate the luminosity function (LF). We find that the LF does show a marked decrease compared to post-reionization measurements, but the change is a factor of $\lesssim 10$, which is less than expected from theoretical calculations and simulations, as well as observational expectations from the pre-JWST literature. Modeling of the IGM and expected \lya\ profiles implies these galaxies reside in ionized bubbles of $\gtrapprox 2$ physical Mpc. We also report that in the four fields we detect {3,1,0,0} LAEs, which could indicate strong field-to-field variation in the LAE distribution, consistent with a patchy HI distribution at $z\sim8$. We compare the recovered LAE number counts with expectations from simulations and discuss the potential implications for reionization and its morphology.</description>

      <title>The size of the continuum emission region and its scaling relations with active galactic nucleus luminosity and the broad-line region size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a continuum lag analysis for a sample of 37 relatively high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP), utilizing the light curve data in $B$ and $V$ bands from SAMP and in $g,r,i$ bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that the inter-band lags ($\tau$) increase with wavelength (i.e., $\tau \propto \lambda^{\sim 4/3}$) as prescribed by the standard disk model (SSD), suggesting consistency with the "lamp-post" reprocessing model. We report that the size of the continuum emitting region (CER) normalized at 2500 {\AA} ($R_{2500}$) is a factor of $\sim$5 (i.e, $0.69\pm0.04$ dex) larger than predicted by SSD. By combining our new measurements with the re-measurements of the literature sample, we report a correlation between $R_{2500}$ and AGN continuum luminosity as $R_{2500} \, \propto \, L_{5100}^{0.58\pm0.03}$, which suggests that the observed continuum could be composed of both the disk emission and the diffuse emission from the broad line region (BLR). The size of CER shows a tight relation with the size of H$\beta$ BLR with a sublinear slope (i.e., $R_{\text{BLR}} \, \propto \, R_{\text{2500}}^{0.87\pm0.07}$) and a scatter of 0.29 dex. This empirical relation offers a promising method for estimating single-epoch black hole masses, once established over a large dynamic range of AGN luminosity.</description>

      <title>Seimei KOOLS-IFU mapping of the gas and dust distributions in Galactic PNe: the origin and evolution of DdDm1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a detailed study of the planetary nebula (PN) DdDm1 in the Galactic halo field. DdDm1 is a metal-deficient and the most carbon-poor PN (C/O = 0.11 +/- 0.02) identified in the Galaxy. We aim to verify whether it evolved into a PN without experiencing the third dredge-up (TDU) during the thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and to investigate its origin and evolution through accurate measurements of the physical parameters of the nebula and its central star. We perform a comprehensive investigation of DdDm1 using multiwavelength spectra. The KOOLS-IFU emission line images achieve ~0.9 arcsec resolution, resolving the elliptical nebula and revealing a compact spatial distribution of the [Fe III] line compared to the [O III] line, despite their similar volume emissivities. This indicates that iron, with its higher condensation temperature than oxygen, is easily incorporated into dust grains such as silicate, making the iron abundance estimate prone to underestimation. Using a fully data-driven approach, we directly derive ten elemental abundances, the gas-to-dust mass ratio, and the gas and dust masses based on our own heliocentric distance scale (19.4 kpc) and the emitting volumes of gas and dust. Our analysis reveals that DdDm1 is a unique PN evolved from a single star with an initial mass of ~1.0 Msun and a metallicity Z of 0.18 Zsun. Thus, DdDm1 is the only known PN that is confirmed to have evolved without experiencing TDUs. The photoionization model reproduces all observed quantities in excellent agreement with predictions from AGB nucleosynthesis, post-AGB evolution, and AGB dust production models. Our study provides new insights into the internal evolution of low-mass and metal-deficient stars like DdDm1 and highlights the role of PN progenitors in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Unevolved Li-rich stars at low metallicity: a possible formation pathway through novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A small fraction of low-mass stars have been found to have anomalously high Li abundances. Although it has been suggested that mixing during the red giant branch phase can lead to Li production, this method of intrinsic Li production cannot explain Li-rich stars that have not yet undergone the first dredge-up. To obtain clues about the origin of such stars, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of four unevolved Li-rich stars with $-2.1 &lt; [\mathrm{Fe/H}] &lt; -1.3$ and $2.9&lt;A({\rm Li})&lt;3.6$, $0.7-1.4$ dex higher Li abundance than typical unevolved metal-poor stars. One of the stars, Gaia DR3 6334970766103389824 (D25_6334), was serendipitously found in the stellar stream ED-3, and the other three stars have been reported to have massive ($M\gtrsim 1.3\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) non-luminous companions. We show that three of the four stars exhibit abundance patterns similar to those of known unevolved Li-rich stars, namely normal abundances in most elements except for Li and Na. These abundance similarities suggest a common origin for the unevolved Li-rich stars and low-mass metal-poor stars with massive compact companions. We also made the first detection of N abundance to unevolved Li-rich stars in D25_6334, and found that it is significantly enhanced ($[\mathrm{N/Fe}]=1.3$). The observed abundance pattern of D25_6334, spanning from C to Si, indicates that its surface has been polluted by an intermediate-mass former companion star or a nova system that involves a massive ONe white dwarf. Using a population synthesis model, we show that the nova scenario can lead to the observed level of Li enhancement and also provide an explanation for Li-rich stars without companions and those with massive compact companions.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Substructure or Source Model Systematics? A Case Study of Cluster Lens Abell S1063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our $\Delta \text{BIC} &gt; 20$ measurement of a $M \sim 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.</description>

      <title>A method for statistical research on binary stars using radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using radial velocity to estimate binary fraction and predict orbital parameter distribution laws is an important method in the studies of binary stars. However, the high dimensionality of the orbital parameters of the binary system pose challenges to this work, particularly in terms of sample size and the accuracy of the calculated results.
  We have proposed and implemented an algorithm called DVCD (Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution) for the statistical analysis of binary properties. % On the basis of higher accuracy than previous methods, the running efficiency of the method is greatly improved. This method not only achieves higher accuracy than previous approaches but also significantly improves computational efficiency. The computing time for the same sample and the hardware environment was reduced to $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ of that of some previous methods.
  Red giant samples from APOGEE DR16 were analyzed using the DVCD method. Both the hyperparameter of the orbital period $\pi$ and the intrinsic binary fraction ($f_{bin}$) can be constrained. We divided the sample into 16 subsets based on log$g$ and $M/H$. Calculation results showed that the binary fraction decreases with the decrease of surface gravity and decreases with the increase of metallicity. This trend provides important constraints on the evolution of binary stars.</description>

      <title>Radiation Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of sub-Eddington Circumbinary Disk around an Equal-mass Massive Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a sub-Eddington circumbinary disk (CBD) around an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass of $2\,\times\,10^7\,M_{\odot}$ on a circular orbit, separated by 100$\,GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation leads to a denser, thinner, and more filamentary disk compared to non-radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation, primarily due to reduced pressure support and an altered equation of state. The RMHD disk also features $\sim 3$ times lower accretion rate ($\approx 0.15\,\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), weaker accretion streams and a less pronounced overdensity (a.k.a., ``lump") at the inner edge. Our analysis of the light curves and thermal spectra reveals that the variability induced by the binary-CBD interaction is distinguishable in the optical/UV band, where CBD shines at about $1\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. These findings underscore the crucial role of radiation on the structure and observational properties of CBDs around massive black hole binaries and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors, and for heavier binaries that are Pulsar Timing Array sources.</description>

      <title>SED Modeling of Young Stellar Objects in the Orion Star Formation Complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a large-scale spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis for young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion star formation complex (OSFC) to derive key physical parameters; temperature, luminosity, mass, and age, using SED models. Our goal is to establish a statistically robust characterization of the stellar population and its evolutionary state across the entire complex. We utilize a set of new radiative transfer model SEDs that span a variety of geometries and parameter spaces. These SEDs are fitted to multi-wavelength photometric data from optical to submillimeter wavelengths. We conducted SED fitting on a sample of 15,396 sources. Among these, 5,062 have at least a reliable AllWISE W3 (12~$\mu$m) detection at longer wavelengths, and 63 have sub-millimeter detections in APEX/SABOCA at 350~$\mu$m or APEX/LABOCA at 870~$\mu$m. The resulting physical parameters are cross-referenced with stellar evolutionary tracks to ensure consistency with theoretical predictions. Sources placed on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram show distinct evolutionary sequences. The results are provided with varying levels of completeness and reliability, depending on the available data for each source. The catalog includes quality indicators such as the flux code, which represents the longest detected wavelength for each source, as well as Prob_W3 and Prob_W4 values that quantify the reliability of the AllWISE W3 and W4 detections. All results, including SED fitting outcomes, uncertainty estimates, and source metadata, are publicly available in a comprehensive CDS table. This dataset provides a statistically significant view of the evolutionary processes within the OSFC. The publicly accessible dataset offers a valuable resource for future studies on star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. II. Long-Timescale Variables including Wide Binary and Late Thermal Pulse Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this second paper on the variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we focus on the 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a 980 day periodic variability with strange characteristics: 'triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. We speculate this to be a wide but eccentric binary with the same orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of 700 days and 230 days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at 1.18 hours which can either be from a close inner binary or pulsational origin. We present CTSS 2 and PN K 3-5 which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPN known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. These appear to be late thermal pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase, though alternative explanations are possible. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1 showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. We think that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.</description>

      <title>FAUST-XXII. Deuteration in the VLA1623-2417 protostellar hot-corinos, cavities, and streamers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of deuterium fractionation is a valuable tool for reconstructing our chemical history from the early prestellar stages to the formation of planets. In the context of the ALMA Large Programme FAUST, we observed formaldehyde, H$_2$CO, and its singly and doubly deuterated forms, HDCO and D$_2$CO, towards the protostellar cluster VLA1623-2417, on scales of ~ 2000 - 50 au. Formaldehyde probes the inner envelopes of the protostars VLA1623A, B, and W, the rotating cavities opened by the VLA1623A outflow, and several streamers. The HDCO and D$_2$CO emissions are observed towards VLA1623A, in its outflow cavities, and in one of the streamers. We estimate the gas temperature from the HDCO lines: T~ 125 K towards VLA1623A, indicating hot-corino emission, lower temperatures in the outflow cavities (20 - 40 K), and in the streamers ($\le15$ K). The D$_2$CO lines also trace the flattened envelope of VLA1623A, where H$_2$CO and HDCO are fainter. This may be due to D$_2$CO formation on dust grains in the cold prestellar phase, and subsequent photodesorption caused by the enhanced UV flux from two nearby B stars. We inferred the molecular deuteration: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.16, ~ 0.07 - 0.13, and ~ 0.3; [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.003, ~ 0.05 - 0.13, and ~ 0.03 in the hot corino, in the outflow cavities, and in the streamer, respectively. The spatial distribution of D$_2$CO, which points to formation on dust grains, and the similar values of [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] in the components of the system, suggest that deuterium fractionation occurs at the prestellar stage and is then inherited, mostly unaltered, in the protostellar phase.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Study of Subgiants and Giants of the Open Cluster M67 using Kepler/K2: Expanded Sample and Precise Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparked by the asteroseismic space revolution, ensemble studies have been used to produce empirical relations linking observed seismic properties and fundamental stellar properties. Cluster stars are particularly valuable because they have the same metallicity, distance, and age, thus reducing scatter to reveal smoother relations. We present the first study of a cluster that spans the full evolutionary sequence from subgiants to core helium-burning red giants using asteroseismology to characterise the stars in M67, including a yellow straggler. We use Kepler/K2 data to measure seismic surface gravity, examine the potential influence of core magnetic fields, derive an empirical expression for the seismic surface term, and determine the phase term $\epsilon$ of the asymptotic relation for acoustic modes, extending its analysis to evolutionary states previously unexplored in detail. Additionally, we calibrate seismic scaling relations for stellar mass and radius, and quantify their systematic errors if surface term corrections are not applied to state-of-the-art stellar models. Our masses show that the Reimers mass loss parameter can not be larger than $\eta$ $\sim$ 0.23 at the 2-$\sigma$ level. We use isochrone models designed for M67 and compare their predictions with individual mode frequencies. We find that the seismic masses for subgiants and red giant branch stars align with the isochrone-predicted masses as per their luminosity and colour. However, our results are inconsistent with the mass of one of the stellar components of an eclipsing binary system near the TAMS. We use traditional seismic $\chi^2$ fits to estimate a seismic cluster age of 3.95 $\pm$ 0.35 Gyrs.</description>

      <title>A Challenge of Developing a Classifier for Multi-Band Classification of Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable stars play a very important role in our understanding of the Milky Way and the universe. In recent years, many survey projects have generated a large amount of photometric data, necessitating classifiers that can quickly identify various types of variable stars. However, obtaining these classifiers often requires substantial manpower and computational resources. To conserve these resources, it would be best to have a classifier that can be used across surveys. We explore the possibility that a classifier created in one optical band can also work in other bands, likely from different survey facilities. We construct a random forest classifier based on photometric data in ASAS-SN V-band and OGLE I-band, and apply the classifier on ASAS-SN V-band and ZTF r-band light curves of variable star samples. We explore the classification differences of using the magnitude light-curves or the normalized flux light-curves, the periods derived from single band light-curves or the periods derived from the multi-band combined light-curves, and with or without color-related features. We find it feasible to develop a classifier capable of working in both V and r bands for certain types of variable stars, such as RRAB variables. For other types of variable stars, like Cepheids, the classifier is unable to make accurate identifications.</description>

      <title>Census of Blue Straggler Stars in Distant Open Clusters and Maximum Fractional Mass Excess of OC BSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identified blue straggler stars (BSSs) in 53 open clusters utilizing data from Gaia DR3. Most of these clusters are situated in the outer regions of the Galactic disc, encompassing structures such as the warp and the Outer arm. We analyzed their astrometric parameters and determined that 48 of them demonstrate high reliability in radial density profile. Furthermore, through manual isochrone fitting and visual inspection, we confirmed 119 BSS candidates and identified 328 additional possible candidates within these clusters. Our results contribute to a 46% increase in the sample size of BSSs in open clusters for regions of the Galactic disc where Rgc &gt; 12 kpc. We observed that the new samples are fainter compared to those identified in the past. Additionally, we investigated the maximum fractional mass excess (Me) of the BSSs in open clusters, including previously published BSS samples. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the capability to produce highest-Me BSSs and the mass of their host clusters. This observation appears to reinforce a fundamental principle whereby an increase in the mass of a star cluster correlates with a higher likelihood of stellar mergers. In contrast, we observe minimal correlation between maximum-Me and the cluster age. Among clusters containing BSSs, younger clusters (0.5 to 1 Gyr) display a scarcity of high-Me BSSs. This scarcity may be attributed to the absence of more massive clusters within this age range.</description>

      <title>The distribution of galaxy rotation in JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST provides a view of the Universe never seen before, and specifically fine details of galaxies in deep space. JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a deep field survey, providing unprecedentedly detailed view of galaxies in the early Universe. The field is also in relatively close proximity to the Galactic pole. Analysis of spiral galaxies by their direction of rotation in JADES shows that the number of galaxies in that field that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way galaxy is ~50% higher than the number of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The analysis is done using a computer-aided quantitative method, but the difference is so extreme that it can be noticed and inspected even by the unaided human eye. These observations are in excellent agreement with deep fields taken at around the same footprint by HST and JWST. The reason for the difference may be related to the structure of the early Universe, but it can also be related to the physics of galaxy rotation and the internal structure of galaxies. In that case the observation can provide possible explanations to other puzzling anomalies such as the Ho tension and the observation of massive mature galaxies at very high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Fermi-detection of gamma-ray Emissions from the Hot Coronae of Radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are well-known powerful $\gamma$-ray emitters. In absence of the jets in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), how the SMBHs work in $\gamma$-ray bands is still unknown despite of great observational efforts made in the last 3 decades. Considering the previous efforts, we carefully select an AGN sample composed of 37 nearby Seyfert galaxies with ultra-hard X-rays for the goals of $\gamma$-ray detections by excluding all potential contamination in this band. Adopting a stacking technique, here we report the significant $\gamma$-ray detection (${\rm TS}=30.6$, or $5.2\,\sigma$) from the sample using 15-year Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observation. We find an average $\gamma$-ray luminosity of the sample as $(1.5\pm1.0)\times10^{40}{\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ at energies from 1-300\,GeV. Limited by the well-known pair production from the interaction of $\gamma$-rays with low energy photons, $\gtrsim$ several GeV $\gamma$-rays are found to originate from an extended corona ($\sim 2.7\times 10^6\,R_{\rm g}$), whereas the canonical much more compact X-ray corona ($\sim 10\,R_{\rm g}$) is responsible for 1 to several GeV $\gamma$-rays. The finding of the compact region lends to strong supports to the long-time theoretical expectations, but the extended corona is beyond all the existing models. One promising scenario is that the electron-positron pairs produced in the compact X-ray corona would expand as fireball, similar to that in $\gamma$-ray bursts, forming the structure of extended corona.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dark Substructure: The Consequences of Atomic Dark Matter on Milky Way Analog Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we explore the properties of subhalos in Milky Way analogs that contain a sub-component of Atomic Dark Matter (ADM). ADM differs from Cold Dark Matter (CDM) due to the presence of self interactions that lead to energy dissipation and bound-state formation, analogous to Standard Model baryons. This model can arise in complex dark sectors that are natural and theoretically-motivated extensions to the Standard Model. The simulations used in this work were carried out using GIZMO and utilize the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics in the Standard Model baryonic sector. For the parameter points we consider, the ADM gas cools efficiently, allowing it to collapse to the center of subhalos. This increases a subhalo's central density and affects its orbit, with more subhalos surviving small pericentric passages. The subset of subhalos that host visible satellite galaxies have cuspier density profiles and smaller stellar-half-mass radii relative to CDM. The entire population of dwarf galaxies produced in the ADM simulations is much more compact than those seen in CDM simulations, unable to reproduce the entire diversity of observed dwarf galaxy structures. Additionally, we also identify a population of highly compact subhalos that consist nearly entirely of ADM and form in the central region of the host, where they can leave distinctive imprints in the baryonic disk. This work presents the first detailed exploration of subhalo properties in a strongly dissipative dark matter scenario, providing intuition for how other regions of ADM parameter space, as well as other dark sector models, would impact galactic-scale observables.</description>

Abstract: We estimate ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) for 48 million giants and dwarfs in low-dust extinction regions from the Gaia DR3 XP spectra by using tree-based machine-learning models trained on APOGEE DR17 and metal-poor star sample \revise{from} Li et al. The root mean square error of our estimation is 0.0890 dex for [M/H] and 0.0436 dex for [$\alpha$/M], when we evaluate our models \revise{on} the test data that are not used in training the models. Because the training data is dominated by giants, our estimation is most reliable for giants. The high-[$\alpha$/M] stars and low-[$\alpha$/M] stars selected by our ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) show different kinematical properties for giants and low-temperature dwarfs. We further investigate how our machine-learning models extract information on ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]). Intriguingly, we find that our models seem to extract information on [$\alpha$/M] from Na D lines (589 nm) and Mg I line (516 nm). This result is understandable given the observed correlation between Na and Mg abundances in the literature. The catalog of ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) as well as their associated uncertainties are publicly available online.</description>

      <title>emPDF: Inferring the Milky Way mass with data-driven distribution function in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the emPDF (Empirical Distribution Function), a novel dynamical modeling method that infers the gravitational potential from kinematic tracers with optimal statistical efficiency under the minimal assumption of steady state. emPDF determines the best-fit potential by maximizing the similarity between instantaneous kinematics and the time-averaged phase-space distribution function (DF), which is empirically constructed from observation upon the theoretical foundation of oPDF (Han et al. 2016). This approach eliminates the need for presumed functional forms of DFs or orbit libraries required by conventional DF- or orbit-based methods. emPDF stands out for its flexibility, efficiency, and capability in handling observational effects, making it preferable to the popular Jeans equation or other minimal assumption methods, especially for the Milky Way (MW) outer halo where tracers often have limited sample size and poor data quality. We apply emPDF to infer the MW mass profile using Gaia DR3 data of satellite galaxies and globular clusters, obtaining enclosed masses of $M(&lt;r)=26\pm8, 46\pm8, 90\pm13$, and $149\pm40 \times 10^{10}M_\odot$ at r=30, 50, 100, and 200 kpc, respectively. These are consistent with the updated constraints from simulation-informed DF fitting (Li et al. 2020). While the simulation-informed DF offers superior precision owing to the additional information extracted from simulations, emPDF is independent of such supplementary knowledge and applicable to general tracer populations. emPDF is currently implemented for tracers with complete 6D kinematics within spherical potentials, but it can potentially be extended to address more general problems.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Galaxies with Extended Emission Line and Potential Outflows in JADES Medium-Band Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we present a systematic search for galaxies with extended emission line and potential outflow features using \textit{JWST} medium-band images in the GOODS-S field. This is done by comparing the morphology in medium-band images to adjacent continuum and UV bands. We look for galaxies that have a maximum extent 50\% larger, an excess area 30\% greater, or an axis ratio difference of more than 0.3 in the medium band compared to the reference bands. After visual inspection, we find 326 candidate galaxies at $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 8.4$, with a peak in the population near cosmic noon, benefiting from the good coverage of the medium-band filters. By fitting their SEDs, we find that the candidate galaxies are at least 20\% more bursty in their star-forming activity and have 50\% more young stellar populations compared to a control sample selected based on the continuum band flux. Additionally, these candidates exhibit a significantly higher production rate of ionizing photons. We further find that candidates hosting known AGN produce extended emission that is more anisotropic compared to non-AGN candidates. A few of our candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed to have prominent outflow signatures through NIRSpec observations, showcasing the robustness of the photometric selection.

      <title>Identifying supermassive black hole recoil in elliptical galaxies</title>

Abstract: We study stellar core growth in simulations of merging massive ($M_\star&gt;10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) elliptical galaxies by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) displaced by gravitational wave induced recoil velocity. With controlled, dense sampling of the SMBH recoil velocity, we find the core radius originally formed by SMBH binary scouring can grow by a factor of 2-3 when the recoil velocity exceeds $\sim50$ per cent of the central escape velocity, and the mass deficit grows by up to a factor of $\sim4$. Using Bayesian inference we predict the distribution of stellar core sizes formed through this process to peak at $\sim1\,\mathrm{kpc}$. An orbital decomposition of stellar particles within the core reveals that radial orbits dominate over tube orbits when the recoil velocity exceeds the velocity dispersion of the core, whereas tube orbits dominate for the lowest recoil kicks. A change in orbital structure is reflected in the anisotropy parameter, with a central tangential bias present only for recoil velocities less than the local stellar velocity dispersion. Emulating current integral field unit observations of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, we uncover a distinct signature in the Gauss-Hermite symmetric deviation coefficient $h_4$ that uniquely constrains the core size due to binary scouring. This signature is insensitive to the later evolution of the stellar mass distribution due to SMBH recoil. Our results provide a novel method to estimate the SMBH recoil magnitude from observations of local elliptical galaxies, and implies these galaxies primarily experienced recoil velocities less than the stellar velocity dispersion of the core.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ I: Central Molecular Zone Overview</title>

Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy and is heavily obscured in the optical and near-IR. We present an overview of the far-IR dust continuum, where the molecular clouds are revealed, provided by Herschel in the inner 40\deg($|l| &lt;$ 20\deg) of the Milky Way with a particular focus on the CMZ. We report a total dense gas ($N$(H$_2$) $&gt; 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) CMZ mass of M=$2\substack{+2 \\ -1} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and confirm that there is a highly asymmetric distribution of dense gas, with about 70-75% at positive longitudes. We create and publicly release complete fore/background-subtracted column density and dust temperature maps in the inner 40\deg ($|l| &lt;$ 20\deg) of the Galaxy. We find that the CMZ clearly stands out as a distinct structure, with an average mass per longitude that is at least $3\times$ higher than the rest of the inner Galaxy contiguously from 1.8\deg $&gt; \ell &gt;$ -1.3\deg. This CMZ extent is larger than previously assumed, but is consistent with constraints from velocity information. The inner Galaxy's column density peaks towards the SgrB2 complex with a value of about 2 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical CMZ molecular clouds are about N(H$_2$)=10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Typical CMZ dust temperatures range from about $12-35$ K with relatively little variation. We identify a ridge of warm dust in the inner CMZ that potentially traces the base of the northern Galactic outflow seen with MEERKAT.</description>

      <title>Weak-lensing Mass Reconstruction of Galaxy Clusters with a Convolutional Neural Network -- II: Application to Next-Generation Wide-Field Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19907v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional weak-lensing mass reconstruction techniques suffer from various artifacts, including noise amplification and the mass-sheet degeneracy. In Hong et al. (2021), we demonstrated that many of these pitfalls of traditional mass reconstruction can be mitigated using a deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we present our improvements and report on the detailed performance of our CNN algorithm applied to next-generation wide-field observations. Assuming the field of view ($3\deg.5 \times 3\deg.5$) and depth (27 mag at $5\sigma$) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we generated training datasets of mock shear catalogs with a source density of 33 arcmin$^{-2}$ from cosmological simulation ray-tracing data. We find that the current CNN method provides high-fidelity reconstructions consistent with the true convergence field, restoring both small and large-scale structures. In addition, the cluster detection utilizing our CNN reconstruction achieves $\sim75$% completeness down to $\sim 10^{14}M_{\odot}$. We anticipate that this CNN-based mass reconstruction will be a powerful tool in the Rubin era, enabling fast and robust wide-field mass reconstructions on a routine basis.</description>

      <title>Precision Analysis of $\mathrm{^{12}C / ^{13}C}$ Ratios in Orion IRc2 Acetylene Isotopologues via $\chi^2$ Fitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$) and its isotopologues in the Orion IRc2 region, focusing on the determination of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios using high-resolution infrared spectra from SOFIA. By employing a robust $\chi^2$ fitting method, we simultaneously determined temperature and column density, achieving a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $18.72^{+1.54}_{-1.46}$ for the blue clump and $15.07^{+1.61}_{-1.60}$ for the red clump. These results revealed significant discrepancies with the traditional rotational diagram method, which overestimated the ratios by 12.1% and 23.9%, respectively. Our $\chi^2$ approach also reduced uncertainties by up to 75%, providing more precise and reliable isotopic ratios. Additionally, we extended the analysis to isotopologues not covered in HITRAN, calculating vibrational and rotational constants through quantum chemical calculations. This allowed us to model subtle isotopic shifts induced by $^{13}$C and deuterium substitution, enabling accurate isotopologue detection in astrophysical environments. The Python package (TOPSEGI) developed in this study facilitates efficient $\chi^2$ fitting and isotopic ratio analysis, making it a valuable tool for future high-resolution observations. This work highlights the critical role of advanced spectral models and fitting techniques in understanding isotopic fractionation and the chemical evolution of interstellar matter.</description>

      <title>Ly-$\alpha$ processing of solid-state Ethanolamine: Potential Precursors to Sugar and Peptide Derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ethanolamine (EA), a key component of phospholipids, has recently been detected in the interstellar medium within molecular clouds. To understand this observation, laboratory studies of its formation and destruction are essential and should be complemented by astrochemical models. This study investigates the photostability of EA ice under Lyman (Ly)-$\alpha$ (10.2 eV) irradiation at 10 K, and explores its potential role in the formation of simple and complex organic molecules in molecular clouds. The UV destruction cross section of EA was estimated to be ($4.7\pm0.3)\times10^{-18}$ cm$^2$, providing insight into its half-life of $6.5\times10^{7}$ yr in dense interstellar clouds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify various photoproducts, with their formation pathways discussed. Ethylene glycol and serine were tentatively detected during the warming up process following irradiation, suggesting that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules such as sugars, peptides and their derivatives. High mass signals detected in the mass spectrometer suggest the presence of several complex organic molecules, and further analysis of residues at room temperature is planned for future work. The results suggest that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules in space, with implications for the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Cold molecular gas in the hot nuclear wind of the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Large Millimeter Telescope and the SEQUOIA 3~mm focal plane array, we have searched for molecular line emission from two atomic clouds associated with the Fermi Bubble of the Milky Way. Neither 12CO nor 13CO J=1-0 emission is detected from the HI cloud, MW-C20. 12CO J=1-0 emission is detected from MW-C21 that is distributed within 11 clumps with most of the CO luminosity coming from a single clump. However, we find no 13CO emission to a 3sigma brightness temperature limit of 0.3 K. Using this limit and RADEX non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) excitation models, we derive H2 column density upper limits of (0.4-3)x10^{21} cm-2 for a set of physical conditions and a H2 to 12CO abundance ratio of 10^4. Model CO-to-H2 conversion factors are derived for each set of physical conditions. We find the maximum value is 1.6x10^{20} cm-2/(K km/s). Increasing [H2/12CO] to 10^5 to account for photodissociation and cosmic ray ionization increases the column density and XCO upper limits by a factor of 10. Applying these XCO limits to the CO luminosities, the upper limit to the total molecular mass in MW-C21 is 132+/-2~Msun, corresponding to less than 27% of the neutral gas mass. For the three clumps that are fully resolved, lower limits to the virial ratios are 288+/-32, 68+/-28, and 157+/-39, which suggest that these structures are bound by external pressure to remain dynamically stable over the entrainment time of 2x10^6 years or are being disrupted by shear and expansion over the clump crossing times of (3-8)x10^5 years. The observations presented in this study add to the growing census of cold gas entrained within the Galactic Center wind.</description>

      <title>High-velocity outflows in [OIII] emitters at z=2.5-9 from JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify galaxies hosting ionised-gas high-velocity outflows from the complete sample of medium resolution (R1000) JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). From a total sample of 1087 [OIII]5007 emitters we identify 40 galaxies with a blue-side broadened [OIII]5007 line at z=2.5-9. Of these, 34 are strong outflow candidates whilst 6 sources have broadening potentially driven by rotating clumps. Our outflow candidate sample is mainly composed of star-forming galaxies, including ~65% starbursts, which span the stellar mass range log10(M*/Msun)=7.5-11.0. It also includes two candidate type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a 'little red dot' (LRD). We report a median outflow velocity of 531(+146)(-159) km/s and an overall incidence rate of 3.4%. These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials. We do find an anti-correlation between mass loading factor and stellar mass up to M* ~(10^10)Msun, with most lowest stellar-mass M*&lt;(10^9)Msun galaxies reaching values well above unity, as is the case for local starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>On a critical acceleration scale of dark matter in Lambda-CDM and dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05606v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal acceleration $a_0$ emerges in various empirical laws, yet its fundamental nature remains unclear. Using Illustris and Virgo N-body simulations, we propose $a_0$ is the scale of acceleration fluctuations in collisionless dark matter involving long-range gravity. In contrast, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo random elastic collisions involving short-range interactions, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant. We identify the redshift evolution $a_0\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ that is in good agreement with Magneticum and EAGLE simulations and in reasonable agreement with limited observations. This suggests a larger $a_0$ at a higher redshift such that galaxies of fixed baryonic mass rotate faster at a higher redshift. The velocity fluctuations involve a critical velocity $u_c\propto (1+z)^{-3/4}$. The acceleration fluctuations involve a critical acceleration $a_c\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$. Two critical quantities are related by the rate of energy cascade $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -{a_c u_c/[2(3\pi)^2]}$, where factor $3\pi$ is from the angle of incidence and $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. With critical velocity $u_c$ on the order of 300 km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is determined to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$, suggesting $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0\approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Note that dark energy (DE) density $\rho_{DE0}\approx {a_{c0}^{2}/G}=10^{-10}$J/m$^3$, we postulate an entropic origin of the dark energy from acceleration fluctuations of dark matter, in analogy to the gas pressure from velocity fluctuations. This leads to a dynamical dark energy coupled to the structure evolution involving a relatively constant DE density followed by a slow weakening phase, suggesting possible deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses. While the dependence of the collapse time on mass and concentration implies such behaviour, our semi-analytical approach allows us to quantify and illustrate this trend clearly across the full mass spectrum of subhalos, including for subhalo masses below the resolution limit of any current cosmological SIDM simulation. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations.

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Mergers as Probes of Dark Matter in Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) from the early Universe that can contribute to dark matter (DM) abundance have been linked to gravitational wave observations. Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies are expected to modify distribution of DM in their vicinity, and can result in highly concentrated DM spikes. We revisit PBH merger rates in the presence of DM spikes, tracking their history. We find novel peaked structure in the redshift-evolution of PBH merger rates at low redshifts around $z \sim 5$. These effects are generic and are present for distinct PBH mass functions and spike profiles, and also can be linked to peaked structure in redshift evolution of star formation rate. Redshift evolution characteristics of PBH merger rates can be distinguished from astrophysical black hole contributions and observable with gravitational waves, enabling them to serve as probes of DM in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Cepheid-based distance ladder: implications for the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is a key parameter in cosmology, yet its precise value remains contentious due to discrepancies between early- and late-universe measurement methods, a problem known as the "Hubble tension." In this study, we revisit the Cepheid-based distance ladder calibration, focusing on two potential sources of bias in the period-luminosity relation (PLR): (1) the assumed prior for the residual parallax offset of the Milky Way (MW) Cepheids and (2) systematic differences between Cepheid periods in anchor galaxies versus supernova host galaxies. To address the latter, we adopt two different strategies alongside a renewed MW Cepheid calibration. The first strategy involves resampling anchor and host Cepheids from a common distribution of periods. This approach provides a conservative estimate of $H_0 = (72.18 \pm 1.76) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis. The increased uncertainty reflects the reduced sample size -- about 700 Cepheids per resampling compared to 3200 in the original dataset. This method reduces the Hubble tension from $5.4 \, \sigma$ (as reported by the SH0ES collaboration with $H_0 = (73.17 \pm 0.86) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$) to $2.4 \, \sigma$. The second strategy allows the PLR slope to vary with the period, yielding $H_0 = (72.35 \pm 0.91) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis, and the tension reduced to $4.4 \, \sigma$. A statistical comparison of the model with the single-linear PLR shows a significant preference for the broken PLR (p-value $&lt; 0.001$). Both strategies consistently indicate a downward shift of approximately $-1 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in $H_0$. Our findings underscore the importance of careful consideration of Cepheid population characteristics for precise $H_0$ calibrations.</description>

Abstract: Carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are among the most important contributors of enriched materials to the interstellar medium due to their strong stellar winds. To fully characterize mass loss on the AGB, it is necessary to determine the distributions of dust and gas around the stars, where the dust begins to condense from the gas, and how this extended atmospheric structure evolves over the pulsational period of the star. We present an analysis of L-band (2.8-4.2 $\mu$m) interferometric observations of the carbon-rich AGB star V Oph made with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI at the maximum and minimum of the star's visual light curve. Using the radiative transfer software RADMC-3D, we model the circumstellar dust shell, and find stellar radii of 395 and 495 $R_{\odot}$ at the two phases, and dust radii of 790 and 742.5 $R_{\odot}$ at the two epochs, respectively. By adding C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN gas to the RADMC-3D models, we are able to fit the visibility spectra well, with some deviations at the 3.11 $\mu$m feature. Reasons for this deviation and interpretation of the best fitting models are discussed in the text, and we discuss motivations for follow-up imaging observations of V Oph.</description>

      <title>A Sizable Discrepancy in Ground-Based JAGB Distances to Nearby Galaxies</title>

Abstract: Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1$\%$ level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of $\Delta\mu$ = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.04 (stat) $\pm$ 0.06 (sys) mag (9$\%$ in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.</description>
