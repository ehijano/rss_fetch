      <title>Field theory vacuum and entropic dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of a novel definition of field theory vacuum energy. The free field Hamiltonian represented as an ensemble of oscillators (in the Fourier space) usually implies the presence of mass scale for these oscillators, which in quantum field theory is of little importance since quantum energy spectrum of oscillator is mass independent. This mass scale, however, may be interesting due to its possible gravitational implications. Since black hole physics puts an upper limit on the total energy within a given region, one obtains constraint on the number of field oscillators. If the mass scale for field oscillators is set by the IR cutoff, then this number saturates the black hole entropy bound. Following this reasoning, one derives various kinds of dark energy models that maybe interesting for further study.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Cosmological Constant and Nature's Constants from SU(3) Confinement Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between three well-established physical principles: QCD confinement, the Third Law of Thermodynamics, and holography, and examine how their combined implications may shed light on several open problems in fundamental physics. As the Universe cools toward absolute zero, color confinement fragments the vacuum into proton-scale domains. The Third Law, which renders $T = 0$ unattainable and prohibits complete entropy elimination, implies that these domains must persist. This leads to a natural count $N \simeq (R_u / R_p)^3 \sim 10^{123}$, where $R_u$ is the radius of the cosmic horizon and $R_p$ is the proton radius. Assuming holographic saturation, each domain corresponds to a Planck-area patch on the cosmic horizon, allowing the Planck length, and hence $\hbar$, $G$, and $c$, to emerge as geometric quantities. The same tiling dilutes the bare Planck-scale vacuum energy by a factor of $N$, reproducing the observed value of $\rho_\Lambda$ without requiring fine-tuned counterterms.</description>

      <title>Kerr Black Holes in an Expanding Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity, describing a collinear array of an arbitrary number of Kerr black holes inside an expanding bubble of nothing is built, thanks to the inverse scattering technique. Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the bubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black hole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble surrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the two constituents.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Systematic Biases in Black Hole Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How long after the merger of two black holes can one rely on linear perturbation theory, and how many quasinormal modes are in the ringdown? Such questions suggest that black hole spectroscopy suffers from systematic uncertainties that potentially spoil ringdown analyses, both from high-accuracy simulations and in data from gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we demonstrate that linear-signal analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying biases, allowing for detailed explorations that are computationally too expensive for traditional Bayesian injection and recovery approaches. We quantify the validity of the Fisher information matrix and bias formula by comparing it to robust but slow Bayesian sampling. Working with flat noise in the time domain, statistical errors and systematic biases can mostly be detected analytically. Due to its efficiency, we provide detailed parameter space analyses for potentially unmodeled small contributions from overtones, quadratic modes, and tails. We find linear signal analysis well suited for predicting biases in simple ringdown models at intermediate SNRs of order 50 when unmodeled effects are small. It is also valuable in explaining ongoing issues in extracting quasinormal modes from high-precision simulations, as one can understand them as high-SNR signals. Therefore, this approach offers promising prospects for improving ringdown models by efficiently identifying and incorporating systematic uncertainties, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and robustness of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5x10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in low lunar orbits, at the Earth-Moon L1 point and in near-rectilinear halo orbits. Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are required to achieve 5x10^{-18} fractional stability, supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>Constraints on multi-fluid cosmology in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity models with different observational data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we incorporate redshift-space distortion measurement to investigate the growth of large scale structure within the framework of multi-fluid cosmology in the context of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Using three different modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity models, we compare the predictions of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity expansion history-through the Friedmann equation with Hubble and BAO data sets and constrain models parameters. Within the context of multi-fluid cosmology in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain the structure growth equation. This equation is then combined with Sigma_8 to get f_Sigma_8 predictions-which is compared with redshift-space distortion data to constrain models parameters to obtain best-fit values including Sigma_8. This involves performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for these specific forms of modified Gauss-Bonnet models.</description>

      <title>Resonant interactions from dynamical perturbers on generic orbits around an extreme mass ratio inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are binary systems where a compact object slowly inspirals into its much larger compact partner. Since we anticipate such systems to exist within and be dynamically influenced by the galactic center environment, we expect them to be instrumental in studying these environments and testing our theories of gravity in the strong field regime. The gravitational waves associated with the EMRI motion fall within the mHz regime, making them target sources for future space-based detectors. However, because of the crowded nature of these galactic centers, these EMRIs could be perturbed by other nearby orbiting bodies. In this work, we analyze potential perturbations in EMRIs due to a third-body perturber near resonance. We use the formalism and code tools developed in the previous paper in this series [Silva \&amp; Hirata, {\slshape Phys. Rev. D} {\bfseries 106}:084508 (2022)] and expand them to account for a general outer body orbit, allowing for multiple resonant interactions within an orbit and across a variety of SMBH spins. We find that, after investigating nearly 142,000 resonant interactions across a restricted set of 180 different simulated orbit systems, none cause changes to the EMRI dynamics beyond a perturbative correction, but could lead to potentially large changes in the phase of the waveform of order 0.1 radian. Detectable phase changes in the waveform induced by third-body perturbers could be a common occurrence and will require careful consideration for developing accurate EMRI waveform models. This analysis suggests that our formalism and pipeline are robust enough to handle a wide variety of resonances from various perturbing orbit configurations around the EMRI, which will aid in developing more accurate waveform models to better probe galactic center environments and test theories of gravity using gravitational wave observations of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the M\"obius band $M$. Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse M\"obius band, which resolves the M\"obius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$, classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$ follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for completeness.</description>

      <title>Geodesics and Shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate geodesics and black hole shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. We show that the equations of motion for null geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined relative to the magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Duality Symmetry and Anomaly for Gravitational Waves in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum Einstein equations admit a formulation closely analogous to the source-free Maxwell theory. In particular, the linearized equations exhibit an electric-magnetic duality symmetry. We develop a framework that makes this analogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components of perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that duality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields constitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the associated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the difference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized components of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and anti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when the gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We then investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality symmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it is anomalously broken in curved backgrounds. As a result, an imbalance between right- and left-handed gravitons could be excited from the vacuum. This effect represents a chiral anomaly for massless spin-two fields, generalizing known results for fermions and spin-one photon fields.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Higher-Curvature Expansions Near the Horizon: Hawking Radiation from Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed model incorporating a series of higher-curvature corrections allows for analytic black-hole solutions at each order of the expansion, with a fully regular black hole emerging in the limit of infinite number of terms. An important question that arises within this framework is how rapidly the series converges. For those classical observables, which are primarily determined by the geometry near the peak of the effective potential, it has been previously shown that the series converges remarkably fast, often within the first two orders. However, this rapid convergence does not extend to quantities such as Hawking radiation, which are highly sensitive to the geometry near the event horizon. Although each successive order yields a result that is significantly closer to that of the full infinite series, several terms are typically required to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the regular black hole in this context.</description>

      <title>A note on Gravitational radiation in generalized Brans-Dicke theory: compact binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note revisits and corrects a previous analysis on gravitational radiation in compact binary systems within the framework of Brans-Dicke-f(R) theories-models featuring both massless and effectively massive scalar fields. We correct the lower bound on the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter $\omega_0$ presented in prior work, identifying teh issue that led to inverted constraints. By reanalyzing data from the binary system PSR J1012+5307, we present revised bounds on $\omega_0$ as a function of the geometrical scalar field mass $m_f$, emphasizing that the role of $\omega_0$ differs from its traditional interpretation in standard BD theory.</description>

      <title>Photon Deflection and Magnification in Kalb-Ramond Black Holes with Topological String Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This theoretical investigation examines gravitational lensing phenomena in Schwarzschild-like black holes (BHs) within Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity frameworks incorporating cosmic string (CS) and cloud of strings (CoS) topological configurations. We develop comprehensive analytical methodologies for investigating photon deflection angles and magnification characteristics in both Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity pierced by CSs (SKRCS) and Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity with CoS (SKRCoS) spacetime geometries through dual approaches: perturbative expansions yielding approximate solutions and exact elliptic integral formulations providing complete mathematical descriptions across parameter spaces. For CS configurations characterized by Lorentz violation (LV) and CS parameters, deflection angles exhibit systematic modifications through composite geometric factors, while CoS geometries demonstrate distinct deflection characteristics incorporating additional topological parameters that fundamentally alter light propagation dynamics. Magnification analysis reveals distinctive critical curve positioning modifications and amplitude scaling relationships enabling observational discrimination between exotic BH scenarios and conventional spacetime geometries. Strong field analysis utilizing established mathematical frameworks establishes logarithmic divergence coefficients characterizing fundamental scaling behavior in photon sphere proximity regimes. Observational constraints from Solar System precision tests restrict LV parameters within stringent bounds, while galactic-scale observations permit expanded parameter ranges for CS and CoS configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal response of both static and rotating black holes in anti de-Sitter spacetime. We perform the neutral scalar field perturbation for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. On the other hand, charged scalar field are used for perturbing Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman black holes. We find that the tidal Love number for all black holes are always nonvanishing due to the presence of cosmological constant. In contrast, tidal dissipation can vanish for certain conditions depending on the scalar field's frequency and the black hole's parameters.</description>

      <title>Gravitons and Temperature Fluctuation Correlations from Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflationary tensor perturbations are treated as arising from a bath of gravitons produced by quantum particle creation at the end of inflation. We calculate the correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations produced by these gravitons in a model with an infrared cut off. The CMB photons are emitted from within a last scattering shell of finite thickness in redshift. We find the correlation function in terms of the separation of a pair of spacetime points of emission in both angle and redshift. In both variables, there is a significant amount of anti-correlation. The anti-correlation minimum has a relative magnitude compared to the central correlation maximum of about 20% in angle and 50% in redshift.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for GW200208\_22 with Targeted Eccentric Numerical-relativity Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed LVK gravitational wave events that show some evidence of eccentricity from TEOBResumS modeling parameter estimations and have confronted them independently with full numerical generated waveforms from our bank of nearly two thousand simulations of binary black holes. We have used RIFT for Bayesian parameter estimation and found that GW200208\_{22} KDE estimates favor eccentricities $e_{20} = 0.217_{-0.184}^{+0.076}$ upon entering the LVK band at $\sim20$Hz within a 90\% confidence limit. Within this event analysis we employed 39 new targeted full numerical relativity simulations and we have thus found a top improved likelihood $\ln \mathcal{L}$ matching waveform, compared to model-based analysis, with an estimated eccentricity at 20Hz, $e_{20}=0.200$, thus reinforcing the eccentric hypothesis of the binary. We have also used our full bank of numerical waveforms on GW190620 finding that it favors eccentricities in the range of {$0\leq e_{10}\leq0.3$}. New specifically targeted simulations will be required to narrow this eccentricity range.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily Negative Energy for Small Kaluza-Klein Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ADM energy of a Kaluza-Klein bubble of nothing is unbounded from below even if the size of the circle at infinity and the size of the minimal sphere at the bubble are fixed. We demonstrate this by presenting a family of explicit time-symmetric initial data satisfying these boundary conditions with arbitrarily negative energy. In particular, this is true for very small bubbles, which indicates that the standard Kaluza-Klein vacuum is more unstable than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Burst from Bremsstrahlung in Milky Way Can Discover Sub-Solar Dark Matter in Near Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is Dark Matter, and what is its concentration in the Milky Way remains an open question in physics. We show that if a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs), gravitational bremsstrahlung resulting from hyperbolic encounters between unbound PBHs within the galactic halos can generate distinctive chromatic gravitational-wave (GW) emission concentrated around the galactic dark matter halo, and it provides a direct window to discover such compact objects. We find that for both generalized NFW and Einasto dark matter profiles of Milky Way, the signal-to-noise ratio can be more than five in one year of observation for the upcoming ground based GW observatories Cosmic Explorer if PBH dark matter fraction $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$ over the mass range $10^{-14} M_\odot \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-8} M_\odot$. Our results show that the Galactic Center could appear as a GW-bright source, enabling new insights into dark matter and its distribution.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent graviton spectral function in Lorentzian quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully self-consistent computation of the graviton spectral function in quantum gravity, using the spectral renormalisation group for gravity put forward in arXiv:2111.13232v2 [hep-th] within a physical mass-shell renormalisation scheme. Here, self-consistency refers to the fact that the full non-perturbative spectral function is used in the diagrams, including the scattering continuum. We find a positive graviton spectral function with a massless one-graviton peak and a multi-graviton continuum with a close-to-quadratic spectral decay in the ultraviolet. Within the physical on-shell renormalisation scheme, the graviton satisfies the sum rule of an asymptotic state and features a unit total spectral weight. We briefly discuss the implications of the physical formulation for the computation of scattering processes and investigations of unitarity in asymptotically safe quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Primordial Power Spectrum and Bispectrum from Lattice Simulations of Axion-U(1) Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present primordial non-Gaussianity predictions from a new high-precision code for simulating axion-U(1) inflation on a discrete lattice. We measure the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum and bispectrum from our simulations, determining their dependence on both scale and axion-gauge coupling strength. Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed in Ref. [1]. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF. It reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation, which enables us to apply the peak theory to estimate the PBH function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves on small scales are not tightly constrained by current cosmological observations, which allows for the possibility of large amplitudes at small scales. We investigate second-order tensor induced gravitational waves (TIGWs) sourced by primordial gravitational waves and present the corresponding corrections to the total energy density spectrum of gravitational wave. We analyze primordial gravitational waves with large amplitudes generated by various models at small scales. Our results indicate that when primordial gravitational waves on small scales sufficiently dominate the current PTA observations, corrections to the total energy density spectrum from second-order TIGWs may become pronounced in certain frequency bands.</description>

      <title>The Chiral Limit of Fully Nonlinear Minimal Massive Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 3D Anti de Sitter Minimal Massive Gravity near the chiral limit where one of the boundary Brown-Henneaux central charges vanishes and two modes become null. We go beyond the known free-theory analysis to prove that these modes decouple completely also in the full MMG Lagrangian and field equations. We also use the full action to ascertain if the interacting theory becomes infinitely strongly coupled in the chiral limit. We show that this is not the case at tree level but that a strong coupling pathology appears in loops, starting at a loop level determined by the number of external legs in the bulk Feynman diagrams. We briefly discuss the relevance of this pathology for the holographic duality between MMG and chiral 2D conformal field theories and comment on its possible resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbit-averaged fluxes of energy and angular momentum generated by a compact binary system of nonspinning particles are obtained in a popular class of massless scalar-tensor theories with first-and-a-half post-Newtonian (1.5PN) accuracy, i.e., 2.5PN accuracy beyond the leading -1PN dipolar radiation. The secular evolution of the orbital elements (frequency and eccentricity) are then also obtained with 1.5PN accuracy. Three technical advances were necessary to obtain these results: (i) the decomposition of the scalar dipole moment as a Fourier series at 1PN order, along with the other moments at Newtonian order, (ii) the derivation of the formula for the passage to the center-of-mass frame at 2.5PN, including a novel hereditary term arising from the contribution of the radiation, and (iii) the complete treatment of the memory-like term appearing in the angular momentum flux. Moreover, as a byproduct of this work, I revisit in the Appendix the treatment in general relativity of the memory integral appearing at 2.5PN order in the angular momentum flux [arXiv:0908.3854], and find that the spurious divergence in the initial eccentricity $e_1$ found there is cured by a careful split between AC and DC terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The loop quantum gravitational collapse of the dust ball in presence of positive cosmological constant is investigated within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario. The dust ball interior is described within the framework of loop quantum cosmology, while its exterior geometry is determined by the differentiability of the spacetime metric at the dust ball surface and the assumption of the (vacuum) exterior to be stationary. In order to determine the global causal structure of the investigated spacetime a robust (numerical) method of constructing Penrose-Carter diagrams is built. Unfortunately the presence of cosmological constant does not cure the problems already present in the case of it vanishing -- the exterior geometry resembles that of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole, in particular featuring timelike singularities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the tunneling process of massive scalar particles from a quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole using the tunneling approach proposed by Parikh and Wilczek. We compute the emission rate of these tunneling particles, which includes quantum correction terms compared to the result in classical General Relativity. These correction terms arise from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the scheme outlined in [1, 2], we derive the entropy of the black hole. Consistent with the universal black hole entropy formula in the context of quantum gravity, our findings include a logarithmic correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine particle production, evaporation, and greybody factors for a Lorentzian non-commutative black hole. We begin by analyzing particle creation for bosons, considering scalar perturbations to compute the Bogoliubov coefficients, which enable the determination of the Hawking temperature $T_{\Theta}$. Subsequently, we describe Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand metric representation, allowing the evaluation of divergent integrals via the residue method. This approach yields the particle creation density for bosonic modes. Next, we extend the analysis to fermions, obtaining the corresponding particle creation density. The black hole evaporation is then examined through the Stefan-Boltzmann law, leading to an estimate of the black hole's lifetime. In this context, we identify the presence of a remnant mass when the black hole reaches the final stage of its evaporation. Furthermore, we compute greybody factors for bosons, taking into account scalar, vector, and tensorial perturbations. Finally, we determine the greybody factors for fermions as well. Overall, compared to the Schwarzschild case ($\Theta = 0$), the presence of the non-commutative parameter $\Theta$ lowers the Hawking temperature and reduces the particle creation density for both bosons and fermions, causing the evaporation process to proceed more slowly. Additionally, $\Theta$ decreases the magnitude of the greybody factors for bosons and fermions across all perturbations considered in this analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms on the gravitational wave memory effect. In certain quantum gravity theories and semi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects) exhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger waveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the detector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features following the initial ringdown phase. Detecting such echoes, or their indirect signatures, would offer compelling evidence for the quantum nature of black holes. Given that direct detection of echoes requires finely tuned waveform templates, exploring alternative imprints of this phenomenon is crucial. In this work, we pursue this goal by calculating corrections to the null memory arising from echo-like features, formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar ${\Psi}_0$. We demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting features is model-independent rendering them conceptually much easier to detect in real interferometer data than the raw echo. The corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of echo-induced features appearing in the gravitational wave memory is estimated subsequently. We further compute the physical fluxes associated to the echo at both the black hole horizon and null infinity and identify novel distinguishing features of the underlying reflectivity models in measurement data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational perturbations of higher-dimensional black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, proposed by Boulware and Deser, have been extensively studied in numerous works, primarily focusing on the fundamental mode. These studies have shown that for sufficiently small black holes, comparing to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter, a dynamical instability arises. In this work, for the first time, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of overtones. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode remains largely unchanged due to the limited stability region, the first few overtones deviate from their Tangherlini limits at an increasing rate. This deviation reflects the impact of the coupling parameter on the near-horizon structure of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Regge poles, grey body factors, and absorption cross sections for black hole metrics with discontinuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently proposed by Rosato {\it et al.} and Oshita {\it et al.} that black hole greybody factors, as stable observables at relatively high frequencies, are more relevant quantities than quasinormal modes in modeling ringdown spectral amplitudes. It was argued that the overall contributions of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes conspire to produce stable observables through collective interference effects. In this regard, the present study investigates the Regge poles, the underlying quantities of the greybody factor governed by the singularities in the complex angular momentum plane, for perturbed black hole metrics. To this end, we generalize the matrix method to evaluate the Regge poles in black hole metrics with discontinuities. To verify our approach, the numerical results are compared with those obtained using a modified version of the continued fraction method. The obtained Regge pole spectrum is then used to calculate the scattering amplitude and cross-section. We show that the stability of these observables at moderate frequencies can be readily interpreted in terms of the stability of the Regge pole spectrum, particularly the low-lying modes. Nonetheless, destabilization still occurs at higher frequencies, characterized by the emergence of a bifurcation in the spectrum. The latter further evolves, leading to more significant deformation in the Regge poles, triggered by ultraviolet metric perturbations moving further away from the black hole. However, based on the validity of the WKB approximation, it is argued that such an instability in the spectrum is not expected to cause significant observable implications.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quasinormal modes, echoes, and black hole spectral instability: a brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a short review of the analytical aspects of recent progress in the study of black hole spectral instability and its potential observational consequences. This topic, inspired by earlier foundational works, has attracted considerable attention in the recent literature. It has been demonstrated that both the low-lying modes and high overtones of black hole quasinormal spectra can be substantially influenced by ultraviolet metric perturbations. The temporal evolution of gravitational wave signals is primarily governed by the first few low-lying quasinormal modes. In contrast, the asymptotic behavior of high overtones is closely associated with the phenomenon of black hole echoes. We review relevant studies on spectral instability in both regimes, highlighting their potential to produce substantial observational signatures in gravitational wave data. Additionally, recent proposals of Regge poles and reflectionless modes as alternative stable observables for probing black hole spacetimes are summarized.</description>

      <title>Kalb-Ramond Black Holes Sourced by ModMax Electrodynamics: Some Perturbative Properties in the Phantom Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and analyze a new class of electrically charged black hole (BH) solutions in Lorentz-violating gravity, where nonlinear ModMax electrodynamics is nonminimally coupled to a Kalb-Ramond (KR) two-form field. The spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz symmetry is triggered by a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the KR field, characterized by a small dimensionless parameter $\ell$. To incorporate both standard and phantom sectors, we introduce a discrete sign-flip parameter $\zeta = \pm1$, which flips the gauge-kinetic terms in the phantom ($\zeta = -1$) branch. Assuming a vanishing cosmological constant and a self-interacting potential with minimum $V' = 0$, we obtain exact analytical solutions for the metric function and electric potential. The resulting spacetime interpolates between Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and ModMax BHs, with curvature scalars showing deviations controlled by $(\ell, \gamma, \zeta)$. We study scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using both frequency-domain (Pade-averaged WKB) and time-domain (Gundlach-Price-Pullin plus Prony) methods. We find that increasing either $\ell$ or the ModMax parameter $\gamma$ enhances the real and imaginary parts of QNMs, indicating higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping, especially in the phantom sector. The effective potentials deepen under phantom deformation, supporting more tightly bound modes. Furthermore, we analyze the greybody factors and compute the sparsity $\eta$ of Hawking radiation, which quantifies the nonthermal character of particle emission. We show that $\eta$ is significantly affected by $\ell$, decreasing with increasing Lorentz violation and asymptotically approaching a scaled version of the Schwarzschild value.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic cosmology using observational datasets: exploring via machine learning approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current study, we present the observational data constraints on the parameters space for an anisotropic cosmological model of Bianchi I type spacetime in general relativity (GR). For the analysis, we consider observational datasets of Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) peak parameters. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is utilized to constrain the best-fit values of the model parameters. For this purpose, we use the publicly available Python code from CosmoMC and have developed the contour plots with different constraint limits. For the joint dataset of CC, BAO, and CMBR, the parameter's best-fit values for the derived model are estimated as $ H_0 = 69.9\pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc, $ \Omega_{m0}=0.277^{+0.017}_{-0.015}$, $ \Omega_{\Lambda 0} = 0.722^{+0.015}_{-0.017}$, and $\Omega_{\sigma 0} = 0.0009\pm0.0001$. To estimate $H(z)$, we explore machine learning (ML) techniques like linear regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and polynomial regression and thereafter analyze the results with the theoretically developed $H(z)$ for the proposed model. Among these ML techniques, the polynomial regression exceeds the performance compared to other techniques. Further, we also note that larger dataset provides a better understanding of the cosmological scenario in terms of ML view point.</description>

      <title>Echoes of bimodal axial gravitational perturbations in a uniform-density star in Einstein-{\AE}ther gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of a uniform-density star in scalar-Einstein-{\AE}ther theory. By applying the Israel junction conditions explicitly in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to the gravitational sector, it is shown that a nontrivial scalar profile cannot be sustained, as it induces a divergence at the stellar center. Since analytical solutions are unattainable, the background metric is determined through numerical integration for a few representative configurations. For axial gravitational perturbations, it is found that the system of equations of motion cannot be decoupled as long as the {\AE}ther parameter $c_i$ does not vanish. Subsequently, the dynamics of the system can be simplified to two coupled equations that describe vector and tensor perturbations with distinct wave velocities $c_V$ and $c_T$, giving rise to a bimodal system. It is shown that as the stellar radius is smaller than that of the maximum of the vacuum Schwarzschild-type effective potential, a potential well is formed, leading to the emergence of echo phenomenon for the axial gravitational perturbations. When the stellar radius exceeds the {\it could-have-been} maximum, the resulting effective potential decreases monotonically, and the wave propagation is primarily dictated by the discontinuity occurring at the star's surface, producing a type of more attenuated echo waves. In addition, we explore the specific properties of the resultant bimodal medium consisting of two degrees of freedom with distinct sound speeds. However, it is understood that such a characteristic does not lead to observational implications, and subsequently hardly offers a potential empirical means to constrain specific metric parameters of the Einstein-{\AE}ther. We present numerical calculations and discuss the potential implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Gauge-Invariant Magnetic Helicity Transport: Basic Formulation and Application to Neutron Star Mergers</title>

Abstract: Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger &amp; Field and Finn &amp; Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>

Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. Different classes of FRBs require different physical mechanisms. If some empirical relations are found for different classes of FRBs, they might justify the classifications scenario and help us to reveal the physical mechanisms behind. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe for cosmology, since their redshifts could be $z\sim 3$ or even higher. Similar to the cosmology of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), some empirical relations might also play an important role in the FRB cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were proposed recently. In particular, it was suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young stellar populations, and some empirical relations have also been found for them, respectively. One of these empirical relations (namely $L_\nu-E$ relation) without dispersion measure (DM) has been used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. So, it is of interest to check the empirical relations with the actual data of current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm. This is beneficial to the FRB cosmology.</description>

      <title>Robust, Rapid, and Simple Gravitational-wave Parameter Estimation</title>

Abstract: Rapid and robust parameter estimation of gravitational-wave sources is a key component of modern multi-messenger astronomy. We present a novel and straightforward method for rapid parameter estimation of gravitational-wave sources that uses metric-based importance sampling. The method enables robust parameter estimation of binary neutron star and binary black hole binaries and is trivially parallelized, enabling parameter estimation in seconds with modest resources. The algorithm achieves a median $35\%$ effective sampling efficiency for a population of aligned-spin neutron star binaries sources. Surprisingly, this approach is also highly efficient for analyzing the full 15-dimensional parameter space of typical binary black holes, with a population median $20\%$ efficiency achieved for a source detected primarily by the twin LIGO observatories and $9\%$ for a network of three comparable sensitivity observatories. This method can serve immediate use to improve the low-latency data products of the gravitational-wave observatory network and may be a key component of how the millions of sources observed by next-generation observatories could be analyzed. The approach can also be broadly applied for problems where an approximate likelihood metric-space can be constructed.</description>

      <title>First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third Post-Minkowskian Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Save $R^2$ Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the latest Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (P-ACT) joint results on the primordial scalar power spectrum, we show that the $R^2$ inflation model extended with a non-minimally coupled scalar field $\chi$--namely the $\chi$-extended $R^2$ inflation model--can naturally accommodate a larger spectral index $n_s$ and a small positive running $\alpha_s$ at cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales, both of which are consistent with the latest P-ACT constraints. This is because the $\chi$ field contributes a blue-tilted component to the primordial power spectrum, which both modifies the large-scale power and, as a result, significantly enhances power on small scales. The deviation of the $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$ from the single field $R^2$ inflation is related to the non-minimal coupling constant $\xi$. The consequent enhancement in the primordial power spectrum can be large enough to lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $\lesssim 10^{20}\mathrm{g}$ as dark matter candidates. Furthermore, future observations of the small-scale power spectrum, CMB spectral distortions, and stochastic gravitational waves will provide decisive tests of this model and its predictions for PBHs. We stress its strong connection to the seesaw mechanism for the generation of the observed small masses.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>
