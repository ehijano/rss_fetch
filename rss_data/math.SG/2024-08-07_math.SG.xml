      <title>Pensive billiards, point vortices, and pucks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by M.Bialy, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.</description>

      <title>Symplectic excision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.03534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use time-independent incomplete Hamiltonian flows to excise interesting closed subsets of positive codimension from symplectic manifolds. Examples of such subsets include what we call a "Cantor brush", a "box with a tail", and -- more generally -- epigraphs of lower semicontinuous functions. This answers a question of Alan Weinstein about excision of a ray, and it generalizes a result of Bernd Stratmann about excision of the product of a ray with a manifold.</description>

      <title>Geometric aspects of a spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the mean field Ising model from a geometric perspective, focusing on the thermodynamic limit. When the number of spins is finite, the Gibbs equilibria form a smooth Legendrian submanifold in the thermodynamic phase space whose points describe the stable macroscopic states of the system. We describe the convergence of these smooth Legendrian submanifolds, as the number of spins goes to infinity, to a singular Legendrian submanifold, admitting an analytic continuation that contains both the stable and metastable states. We also discuss the relaxation to a Gibbs equilibrium when the physical parameters are changed abruptly. The relaxation is defined via the gradient flow of the free energy with respect to the Wasserstein metric on microscopic states, that is, in the geometric language, via the gradient flow of the generating function of the equilibrium Legendrian with respect to the ghost variables. This leads to a discrete Fokker-Planck equation when the number of spins is finite. We show that in the thermodynamic limit this description is closely related to the seminal model of relaxation proposed by Glauber. Finally, we find a special range of parameters where such relaxation happens instantaneously, along the Reeb chords connecting the initial and the terminal Legendrian submanifolds.</description>

      <title>The Traveling Mailman: Topological Optimization Methods for User-Centric Redistricting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new districting approach using the US Postal Service network to measure community connectivity. We combine Topological Data Analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to assess district boundaries' impact on community integrity. Using Iowa as a case study, we generate and refine districting plans using KMeans clustering and stochastic rebalancing. Our method produces plans with fewer cut edges and more compact shapes than the official Iowa plan under relaxed conditions. The low likelihood of finding plans as disruptive as the official one suggests potential inefficiencies in existing boundaries. Gaussian Mixture Model analysis reveals three distinct distributions in the districting landscape. This framework offers a more accurate reflection of community interactions for fairer political representation.</description>
