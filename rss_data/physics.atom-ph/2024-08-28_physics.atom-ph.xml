      <title>Effect of Rabi dynamics in resonant x-ray scattering of intense attosecond pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the effects of Rabi oscillations on resonant x-ray scattering in Ne$^+$ using intense attosecond and few-femtosecond pulses. The total photon yield strongly depends on the pulse area and has an upper bound at high intensities. Resonant scattering yields with attosecond pulses can be an order of magnitude higher than those far from resonances. Interference between resonant fluorescence and elastic scattering channels depends on the pulse area and initial state. Our results suggest that resonant x-ray scattering can be exploited for high-resolution, site-specific imaging.</description>

      <title>Ionization potential of radium monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14673v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionization potential (IP) of radium monofluoride (RaF) was measured to be 4.969(2)[10] eV, revealing a relativistic enhancement in the series of alkaline earth monofluorides. The results are in agreement with a relativistic coupled-cluster prediction of 4.969[7] eV, incorporating up to quantum electrodynamics corrections. Using the same computational methodology, an improved calculation for the dissociation energy ($D_{e}$) of 5.56[5] eV is presented. This confirms that radium monofluoride joins the small group of diatomic molecules for which $D_{e}&gt;\mathrm{IP}$, paving the way for precision control and interrogation of its Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Performance of Antenna-based and Rydberg Quantum RF Sensors in the Electrically Small Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom electric field sensors are tunable quantum sensors that can perform sensitive radio frequency (RF) measurements. Their qualities have piqued interest at longer wavelengths where their small size compares favorably to impedance-matched antennas. Here, we compare the signal detection sensitivity of cm-scale Rydberg sensors to similarly sized room-temperature electrically small antennas with active and passive receiver backends. We present and analyze effective circuit models for each sensor type, facilitating a fair sensitivity comparison for cm-scale sensors. We calculate that contemporary Rydberg sensor implementations are less sensitive than unmatched antennas with active amplification. However, we find that idealized Rydberg sensors operating with a maximized atom number and at the standard quantum limit may perform well beyond the capabilities of antenna-based sensors at room temperature, the sensitivities of both lying below typical atmospheric background noise.</description>

      <title>Long-lived entanglement of molecules in magic-wavelength optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realising quantum control and entanglement of particles is crucial for advancing both quantum technologies and fundamental science. Significant developments in this domain have been achieved in a variety of systems. In this context, ultracold polar molecules offer new and unique opportunities due to their more complex internal structure associated with vibration and rotation, coupled to the existence of long-range interactions. However, the same properties make molecules highly sensitive to their environment, impacting their coherence and utility in some applications. Here we show that by engineering an exceptionally controlled environment using rotationally-magic optical tweezers, we can achieve long-lived entanglement between pairs of molecules using hertz-scale interactions. We demonstrate the highest reported fidelity to date for a two-molecule Bell state ($0.976^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$) and present the first realisation of a microwave-driven entangling gate between two molecules, preparing the molecules in a decoherence-free subspace. We show that the magic-wavelength trap preserves the entanglement, with no measurable decay over 0.5 s, opening new avenues for quantum-enhanced metrology, ultracold chemistry and the use of rotational states for quantum simulation, quantum computation and as quantum memories. The extension of precise quantum control to complex molecular systems will allow their additional degrees of freedom to be exploited across many domains of quantum science.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic couplings as a stabilization mechanism in long-range Rydberg molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range Rydberg molecules are typically bound in wells formed in their oscillatory potential energy curves. In alkaline Rydberg molecules, bound vibrational states exist even when these potential wells are disrupted by level repulsion from the steep butterfly potential energy curve induced by a scattering shape resonance. The binding in this case is attributed to quantum reflection. However, the rapidly varying regions of the potential energy landscape where quantum reflection occurs often coincide with regions where non-adiabatic coupling becomes significant. By comparing the molecular states calculated within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where quantum reflection is the only binding mechanism, with those obtained from the full set of coupled channel equations, we can assess the effects of non-adiabatic coupling on vibrational energies and lifetimes. Our findings show that these couplings can stabilize the molecule by providing an additional barrier which protects the vibrational states from predissociation and non-radiative transitions. There can also be extreme cases where non-adiabatic coupling completely dominates the binding and the molecular lifetimes saturate at the atomic Rydberg lifetime.</description>

      <title>A Reassessment of 5f Occupation in Plutonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed spectroscopic simulation of the original Pu N4,5 and O4,5 X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) has been performed. Additionally, a fundamental flaw in the Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) measurement has been corrected. Thus, the determination of the 5f occupation (n) in elemental Pu has been re-evaluated with the result that n = 5.0 +/- 0.1 for alphaPu and n = 4.9 +/- 0.2 for deltaPu. These values are significantly lower than the value of ~5.5 that was propagated earlier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a comprehensive analysis of the historical literature, we model the geometry of the Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment to numerically calculate the magnetic field using the finite-element method. Using this calculated field and Monte Carlo methods, the atomic translational dynamics are simulated to produce the well-known quantized end-pattern with matching dimensions. The finite-element method used provides the most accurate description of the Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach magnetic field and end-pattern in the literature, matching the historically reported values and figures.</description>

      <title>Scalar Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect: Generalization of the Gravitational Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that demonstrates how potentials can have observable effects even when the classical fields associated with those potentials are absent. Initially proposed for electromagnetic interactions, this effect has been experimentally confirmed and extensively studied over the years. More recently, the effect has been observed in the context of gravitational interactions using atom interferometry. Additionally, recent predictions suggest that temporal variations in the phase of an electron wave function will induce modulation sidebands in the energy levels of an atomic clock, solely driven by a time-varying scalar gravitational potential [1]. In this study, we consider the atomic clock as a two-level system undergoing continuous Rabi oscillations between the electron's ground and excited state. We assume the photons driving the transition are precisely frequency-stabilized to match the transition, enabling accurate clock comparisons. Our analysis takes into account, that when an atom transitions from its ground state to an excited state, it absorbs energy, increasing its mass according to the mass-energy equivalence principle. Due to the mass difference between the two energy levels, we predict that an atomic clock in an eccentric orbit will exhibit a constant frequency shift relative to a ground clock corresponding to the orbit's average gravitational redshift, with additional modulation sidebands due to the time-varying gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>Controlling few-body reaction pathways using a Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaining control over chemical reactions on the quantum level is a central goal of the modern field of cold and ultracold chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to coherently steer reaction flux of a three-body recombination process across different product spin channels. For this, we employ a magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows for the control of the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to significantly change the reaction products. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics. We find that while the Efimov resonance can be used to globally enhance three-body recombination, the relative flux between the reaction channels remains unchanged. Our control scheme is general and can be extended to other reaction processes. It also provides new opportunities in combination with other control schemes, such as quantum interference of reaction paths.</description>

      <title>Exact Polaron-Polaron interactions in a Quantum Hall Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for effective polaron-polaron interactions between heavy impurities, mediated by a sea of non-interacting light fermions in the quantum Hall regime with highly degenerate Landau levels. For weak attraction between impurities and fermions, where only the manifold of lowest Landau levels is relevant, we obtain an analytical expression of mediated polaron-polaorn interactions. Remarkably, polaron interactions are exactly zero when fermions in lowest Landau levels outnumber heavy impurities. For strong attraction, different manifolds of higher Landau levels come into play and we derive a set of equations that can be used to numerically solve the mediated polaron interaction potential. We find that the potential vanishes when the distance R between impurities is larger than the magnetic length, but strongly diverges at short range following a Coulomb form -1/R. Our exact results of polaron-polaron interactions might be examined in cold-atom setups, where a system of Fermi polarons in the quantum Hall regime is realized with synthetic gauge field or under fast rotation. Our predictions could also be useful to understand the effective interaction between exciton-polarons in electron-doped semiconductors under strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Polaronic neutron in dilute alpha matter: A $p$-wave Bose polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate quasiparticle properties of a neutron immersed in an alpha condensate, which is one of the possible states of dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The resonant $p$-wave neutron-alpha scattering, which plays a crucial role in forming halo nuclei, is considered. This system is similar to a Bose polaron near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance that can be realized in cold-atomic experiments. Calculating the low-momentum self-energy within the field-theoretical approach, we give an analytical formula for the effective mass of a polaronic neutron as a function of alpha condensation density. Two adjacent neutrons in a medium, each of which behaves like a stable polaron having an enhanced effective mass, can form a bound dineutron, with the help of $^1S_0$ neutron-neutron attraction. This is in contrast to the case of the vacuum, where a dineutron is known to be unbound. Moreover, adding an impurity-like neutron to symmetric nuclear matter can be regarded as a perturbation accompanied by an explicit breaking of Wigner's $ SU \left( 4 \right) $ symmetry. The relationship between the polaron energy and the Wigner term in nuclear mass formulas is discussed in the low-density limit. Our result would be useful for understanding many-body physics in astrophysical environments as well as the formation of multi-nucleon clusters in neutron-halo nuclei.</description>

      <title>Low-cost demonstration of the Zeeman effect: From qualitative observation to quantitative experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zeeman effect, a fundamental quantum phenomenon, demonstrates the interaction between magnetic fields and atomic systems. While precise spectroscopic measurements of this effect have advanced significantly, there remains a lack of simple, visually accessible demonstrations for educational purposes. Here, we present a low-cost experiment that allows for direct visual observation of the Zeeman effect. Our setup involves a flame containing sodium (from table salt) placed in front of a sodium vapor lamp. When a magnetic field is applied to the flame, the shadow cast by the flame noticeably lightens, providing a clear, naked-eye demonstration of the Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we conduct two quantitative experiments using this setup, examining the effects of varying magnetic field strength and sodium concentration. This innovative approach not only enriches the experimental demonstration for teaching atomic physics at undergraduate and high school levels but also provides an open platform for students to explore the Zeeman effect through hands-on experience.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves emerge when the system is perturbed from its ground state in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). These waves can interact nonlinearly, leading to turbulent cascades. In the present work, the turbulence of random weakly nonlinear Bogoliubov waves on the background of a uniform condensate is considered theoretically, within the Wave Turbulence approach, and numerically, via numerical simulations of the 3-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii model and the associated wave-kinetic equations. A new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum is found for the short Bogoliubov waves. An exact prefactor constant was found for the previously known Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum of long (acoustic) Bogoliubov waves. The results are used to explain the BEC equation of state experimentally obtained in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new settings for future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the complete set of transition frequencies necessary to laser cool and trap MgF molecules. Specifically, we report the frequency of multiple low $J$ transitions of the $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=0,1) \rightarrow A^2\Pi_{1/2}(v^\prime=0)$, $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1,2) \rightarrow A^2\Pi_{1/2}(v^\prime=1)$, and $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1) \rightarrow B^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime}=0)$ bands of MgF. The measured $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1)\rightarrow B^2\Sigma^+(v^\prime=0)$ spectrum allowed the spin-rotation and hyperfine parameters of the $B^2\Sigma^+(v=0)$ state of MgF to be determined. Furthermore, we demonstrate optical cycling in MgF by pumping molecules into the $X^2\Sigma^+(v=1,2)$ states. Optical pumping enhances the spectroscopic signals of transitions originating in the $N^{\prime\prime}=1$ level of the $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1,2)$ states.</description>

      <title>Theory of resonant x-ray scattering with ultrafast intense pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) approach within a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework to investigate resonant x-ray scattering under intense x-ray pulses. This method enables us to explore how coherent x-ray electron dynamics affect scattering signals from Ne$^+$. We account for both resonant fluorescence and elastic scattering channels, while also considering competing photoionization and inner-shell decay processes. By computing the angular distribution and energy spectrum of scattered photons, we uncover the interference effects between elastic scattering and resonant fluorescence pathways. Notably, our results reveal a small asymmetry in the energy spectrum as a result of this interference. We discuss the experimental potential for detecting signatures of interference. Our findings demonstrate that the x-ray Rabi dynamics can be used to control scattering responses and offer new insights into interference mechanisms and scattering efficiency in high-intensity x-ray regimes.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.338$\pm$0.024 eV [Kraemer et al., Nature 617, 706 (2023)]. It was found that within the uncertainty range of both atomic and nuclear excitation energies, the rate of nuclear excitation by electron transition can vary by more than 20 orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.05\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV). Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from tenths to approximately $6\times10^{19}$ s$^{-1}$. Thus, EBIT experimental studies could serve as an extremely sensitive tool for the independent verification of the excitation energy of the isomeric state in the $^{229}$Th nucleus.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical modeling of the multi-stage Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch and Segr\`e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-stage Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch and Segr\`e includes two cascaded quantum measurements with a nonadiabatic flipper in between. The Frisch and Segr\`e experiment has been modeled analytically by Majorana without the nuclear effect and subsequently revised by Rabi with the hyperfine interaction. However, the theoretical predictions do not match the experimental observation accurately. Here, we numerically solve the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, including the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. Thus far, the coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model without using free parameters are still low, indicating a mismatch between the theory and the experiment. Non-standard variants that improve the match are explored for discussion.</description>

      <title>A dissipation-induced superradiant transition in a strontium cavity-QED system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), emitters and a resonator are coupled together to enable precise studies of quantum light-matter interactions. Over the past few decades, this has led to a variety of quantum technologies such as more precise inertial sensors, clocks, memories, controllable qubits, and quantum simulators. Furthermore, the intrinsically dissipative nature of cavity QED platforms makes them a natural testbed for exploring driven-dissipative phenomena in open quantum systems as well as equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions in quantum optics. One such model, the so-called cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, concerns the behavior of coherently driven emitters in the presence of collective dissipation (superradiance). Despite tremendous interest, this model has yet to be realized in a clean experimental system. Here we provide an observation of the continuous superradiant phase transition predicted in the CRF model using an ensemble of ultracold $^{88}$Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse optical cavity on a long-lived optical transition. Below a critical drive, atoms quickly reach a steady state determined by the self-balancing of the drive and the collective dissipation. The steady state possesses a macroscopic dipole moment and corresponds to a superradiant phase. Above a critical drive strength, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations until other decoherence processes kick in. In fact, our platform also allows us to witness the change of this phase transition from second to first order induced by single-particle spontaneous emission, which pushes the system towards a different steady state. Our observations are a first step towards finer control of driven-dissipative systems, which have been predicted to generate quantum states that can be harnessed for quantum information processing and in particular quantum sensing.</description>
