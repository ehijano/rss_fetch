      <title>Sign patterns which require or allow the strong multiplicity property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a study of sign patterns that require or allow the non-symmetric strong multiplicity property (nSMP). We show that all cycle patterns require the nSMP, regardless of the number of nonzero diagonal entries. We present a class of Hessenberg patterns that require the nSMP. We characterize which star sign patterns require, which allow, and which do not allow the nSMP. We show that if a pattern requires distinct eigenvalues, then it requires the nSMP. Further, we characterize the patterns that allow the nSMP as being precisely the set of patterns that allow distinct eigenvalues, a property that corresponds to a simple feature of the associated digraph. We also characterize the sign patterns of order at most three according to whether they require, allow, or do not allow the nSMP.</description>

      <title>On the length of a class of maximal commutative subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A maximal commutative subalgebra is a substructure in algebra with the greatest commutative property. By studying the lengths of maximal commutative subalgebras, one can more clearly characterize the structure of commutative subalgebras in the full matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_n({\mathbb{F}})$. Inspired by \cite[Proposition~4.12]{markova2013}, this paper identifies a class of maximal commutative subalgebras $\mathcal{B}_{k,m,l}$ and computes their lengths. Finally, we present two concrete examples to show that it is not a straightforward generalization.</description>

      <title>Cut Groups: The Progress And The Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the study of cut groups, i.e., the groups which have only trivial central units in their integral group ring. We provide state of art for cut groups. The results are compiled in a systematic manner and have also been analogously studied for some generalised classes, such as quadratic rational groups and semi-rational groups etc. For these bigger classes, some results have been extended, while others have been posed as questions. The progress and the problems signify the development and the potential that holds in the topic of cut groups and its generalisations.</description>

      <title>Deformation and quantization of the Loday-Quillen-Tsygan isomorphism for Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an associative algebra $A$, the famous theorem of Loday, Quillen and Tsygan says that there is an isomorphism between the graded symmetric product of the cyclic homology of $A$ and the Lie algebra homology of the infinite matrices $\mathfrak{gl}(A)$, as commutative and cocommutative Hopf algebras. This paper aims to study a deformation and quantization of this isomorphism. We show that if $A$ is a Koszul Calabi-Yau algebra, then the primitive part of the Lie algebra homology $\mathrm{H}_\bullet (\mathfrak{gl}(A))$ has a Lie bialgebra structure which is induced from the Poincar\'e duality of $A$ and deforms $\mathrm{H}_\bullet (\mathfrak{gl}(A))$ to a co-Poisson bialgebra. Moreover, there is a Hopf algebra which quantizes such a co-Poisson bialgebra, and the Loday-Quillen-Tsygan isomorphism lifts to the quantum level, which can be interpreted as a quantization of the tangent map from the tangent complex of $\mathrm{BGL}$ to the tangent complex of K-theory.</description>

      <title>A P-theorem for Inverse Semigroupoids through Ordered Globalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every ordered partial action of an inverse semigroupoid on a partially ordered set admits a globalization. This result is used to establish a connection between ordered partial actions of groupoids and a multi-object analogue of McAlister triples. As a consequence, we obtain a multi-object version of the P-theorem: every E-unitary inverse semigroupoid is isomorphic to a semidirect product arising from an ordered partial action of a groupoid on a multi-object version of a semilattice.</description>

      <title>Cocommutative Com-PreLie bialgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.08171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Com-PreLie bialgebra is a commutative bialgebra with an extra preLie product satisfying some compatibilities with the product and coproduct. We here give a classification of connected, cocommutative Com-PreLie bialgebras over a field of characteristic zero: we obtain a main family of symmetric algebras on a space V of any dimension, and another family available only if V is one-dimensional. We also explore the case of Com-PreLie bialgebras over a group algebra and over a tensor product of a group algebra and of a symmetric algebra.</description>

      <title>Lie-Yamaguti Algebra Bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Lie-Yamaguti algebra bundle, define its cohomology groups with coefficients in a representation and show that such bundles appeared naturally from geometric considerations in the work of M. Kikkawa, which motivates us to introduce this object in the proper mathematical framework. We also study abelian extensions of Lie-Yamaguti algebra bundles and investigate their relationship with suitable cohomology group.</description>

      <title>Self-distributive algebras and bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of self-distributive algebraic structures: algebras, bialgebras; additional structures on them, relations of these structures with Hopf algebras, Lie algebras, Leibnitz algebras etc. The basic example of such structures are rack- and quandle bialgebras. But we go further - to the general coassociative comultiplication. The principal motivation for this work is the development of the linear algebra related with a notion of a quandle in analogy with the ubiquitous role of group algebras in the category of groups with perspective applications to the theory of knot invariants. We give description of self-distributive algebras and show that some quandle algebras and some Novikov algebras are self-distributive. Also, we give a full classification of counital self-distributive bialgebras in dimension 2 over C.</description>

      <title>Root graded groups of type $ H_3 $ and $ H_4 $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the well-known realisation of the root system $ H_4 $ as a folding of $ E_8 $, one can construct examples of $ H_4 $-graded groups from Chevalley groups of type $ E_8 $. Such Chevalley groups are defined over a commutative ring $ R $, and the root groups of the resulting $ H_4 $-grading are coordinatised by $ R \times R $. We show that every $ H_4 $-graded group arises as the folding of an $ E_8 $-graded group, or in other words, that it is coordinatised by $ R \times R $ for some commutative ring $ R $. We also prove similar assertions for $ (D_6, H_3) $ in place of $ (E_8, H_4) $.</description>

      <title>Higher hereditary algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras arising from some toric singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graded and ungraded singularity categories of some commutative Gorenstein toric singularities, namely, Veronese subrings of polynomial rings, and Segre products of some copies of polynomial rings. We show that the graded singularity category has a tilting object whose endomorphism ring is higher representation infinite. Moreover, we construct the tilting object so that the endomorphism ring has a strict root pair of its higher Auslander-Reiten translation, which allows us to give equivalences between singularity categories and (folded) cluster categories in a such a way that their cluster tilting objects correspond to each other. Our distinguished form of tilting objects also allows us to construct (twisted) Calabi-Yau algebras as the Calabi-Yau completions of the root pairs. We give an explicit description of these twisted Calabi-Yau algebras as well as the higher representation infinite algebras in terms of quivers and relations. Along the way, we prove that certain idempotent quotients of higher representation infinite algebras remain higher representation infinite.</description>
