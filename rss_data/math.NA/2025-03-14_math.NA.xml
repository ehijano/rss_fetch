      <title>Data-driven geometric parameter optimization for PD-GMRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restarted GMRES is a robust and widely used iterative solver for linear systems. The control of the restart parameter is a key task to accelerate convergence and to prevent the well-known stagnation phenomenon. We focus on the Proportional-Derivative GMRES (PD-GMRES), which has been derived using control-theoretic ideas in [Cuevas N\'u\~nez, Schaerer, and Bhaya (2018)] as a versatile method for modifying the restart parameter. Several variants of a quadtree-based geometric optimization approach are proposed to find a best choice of PD-GMRES parameters. We show that the optimized PD-GMRES performs well across a large number of matrix types and we observe superior performance as compared to major other GMRES-based iterative solvers. Moreover, we propose an extension of the PD-GMRES algorithm to further improve performance by controlling the range of values for the restart parameter.</description>

      <title>A second order numerical scheme for optimal control of non-linear Fokker-Planck equations and applications in social dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a second-order numerical scheme to address the solution of optimal control problems constrained by the evolution of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations arising from socio-economic dynamics. In order to design an appropriate numerical scheme for control realization, a coupled forward-backward system is derived based on the associated optimality conditions. The forward equation, corresponding to the Fokker-Planck dynamics, is discretized using a structure preserving scheme able to capture steady states. On the other hand, the backward equation, modeled as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman problem, is solved via a semi-Lagrangian scheme that supports large time steps while preserving stability. Coupling between the forward and backward problems is achieved through a gradient descent optimization strategy, ensuring convergence to the optimal control. Numerical experiments demonstrate second-order accuracy, computational efficiency, and effectiveness in controlling different examples across various scenarios in social dynamics. This approach provides a reliable computational tool for the study of opinion manipulation and consensus formation in socially structured systems.</description>

      <title>Fast Maxwell Solvers Based on Exact Discrete Eigen-Decompositions I. Two-Dimensional Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose fast solvers for Maxwell's equations in rectangular domains. We first discretize the simplified Maxwell's eigenvalue problems by employing the lowest-order rectangular N\'ed\'elec elements and derive the discrete eigen-solutions explicitly, providing a Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition framework at the discrete level. Based on exact eigen-decompositions, we further design fast solvers for various Maxwell's source problems, guaranteeing either the divergence-free constraint or the Gauss's law at the discrete level. With the help of fast sine/cosine transforms, the computational time grows asymptotically as $\mathcal{O}(n^2\log n)$ with $n$ being the number of grids in each direction. Our fast Maxwell solvers outperform other existing Maxwell solvers in the literature and fully rival fast scalar Poisson/Helmholtz solvers based on trigonometric transforms in either efficiency, robustness, or storage complexity. It is also utilized to perform an efficient pre-conditioning for solving Maxwell's source problems with variable coefficients. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed fast solver.</description>

      <title>Far-Field Sensitivity to Local Boundary Perturbations in 2D Wave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the sensitivity of the scattered wave field to perturbations in the shape of a scattering body illuminated by an incident plane wave. This study is motivated by recent work on the inverse problem of reconstructing a scatterer shape from measurements of the scattered wave at large distances from the scatterer. For this purpose we consider star-shaped scatterers represented using cubic splines, and our approach is based on a Nystr\"om method-based discretisation of the shape derivative. Using the singular value decomposition, we identify fundamental geometric modes that most strongly influence the scattered wave, providing insight into the most visible boundary features in scattering data.</description>

      <title>A Neumann-Neumann Acceleration with Coarse Space for Domain Decomposition of Extreme Learning Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme learning machines (ELMs), which preset hidden layer parameters and solve for last layer coefficients via a least squares method, can typically solve partial differential equations faster and more accurately than Physics Informed Neural Networks. However, they remain computationally expensive when high accuracy requires large least squares problems to be solved. Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) for ELMs have allowed parallel computation to reduce training times of large systems. This paper constructs a coarse space for ELMs, which enables further acceleration of their training. By partitioning interface variables into coarse and non-coarse variables, selective elimination introduces a Schur complement system on the non-coarse variables with the coarse problem embedded. Key to the performance of the proposed method is a Neumann-Neumann acceleration that utilizes the coarse space. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant speedup compared to a previous DDM method for ELMs.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Non-local Quasicontinuum Approach for Efficient Modeling of Architected Truss-based Lattice Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the substantial computational costs associated with modeling the mechanical behavior of large-scale architected lattice structures, this work introduces a concurrent multiscale approach: the Generalized Non-local Quasicontinuum (GNQC) method. GNQC generalizes the classical nonlocal Quasicontinuum framework by eliminating the assumption of affine or high-order deformation patterns for accurate energy sampling in coarse-grained regions and by ensuring consistency with general finite element shape functions used for coarse-graining. The introduced GNQC method offers three key features: (1) a constitutive-model-consistent framework that employs the same lattice constitutive relationship in both the locally full-resolution region and the coarse-grained domain, similar to existing nonlocal QC approaches; (2) a shape-function consistent energy sampling mechanism that aligns with the interpolation order of the generally employed shape functions, differing significantly from existing Quasicontinuum works and substantially reducing computational costs; and (3) consistent interfacial compatibility, which enables seamless energy and force transfer across interfaces between regions of different resolutions without cumbersome interfacial treatments. The performance of GNQC is validated through a series of numerical test cases, including tension, clamped bending, three-point bending, and crack propagation problems, that demonstrate good accuracy. Additionally, the error analysis and convergence behavior of GNQC are investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a finite element method employing the Ned\'el\'ec element space for solving the Maxwell's transmission eigenvalue problem in anisotropic media. The well-posedness of the source problems are derived using $\mathbb T$-coercivity approach. We discuss the discrete compactness property of the finite element space under the case of anisotropic coefficients and conduct a finite element error analysis for the proposed approach. Additionally, we present some numerical examples to support the theoretical result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for solving nonlinear systems we propose two pseudoinverse-free greedy block methods with momentum by combining the residual-based weighted nonlinear Kaczmarz and heavy ball methods. Without the full column rank assumptions on Jacobi matrices of nonlinear systems, we provide a thorough convergence analysis, and derive upper bounds for the convergence rates of the new methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods with momentum are much more effective than the existing ones.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient norm preserving numerical schemes for micromagnetic energy minimization based on SAV method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, two efficient and magnetization norm preserving numerical schemes based on the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method are developed for calculating the ground state in micromagnetic structures. The first SAV scheme is based on the original SAV method for the gradient flow model, while the second scheme features an updated scalar auxiliary variable to better align with the associated energy. To address the challenging constraint of pointwise constant magnetization length, an implicit projection method is designed, and verified by both SAV schemes. Both proposed SAV schemes partially preserve energy dissipation and exhibit exceptional efficiency, requiring two linear systems with constant coefficients to be solved. The computational efficiency is further enhanced by applying the Discrete Cosine Transform during the solving process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our SAV schemes outperform commonly used numerical methods in terms of both efficiency and stability.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling of resonant behavior in scattering problems through adaptive rational approximation and sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes novel algorithms for the identification of (almost-)resonant behavior in scattering problems. Our methods, relying on rational approximation, aim at building surrogate models of what we call "field amplification", defined as the norm of the solution operator of the scattering problem, which we express through boundary-integral equations. To provide our techniques with theoretical foundations, we first derive results linking the field amplification to the spectral properties of the operator that defines the scattering problem. Such results are then used to justify the use of rational approximation in the surrogate-modeling task. Some of our proposed methods apply rational approximation in a "standard" way, building a rational approximant for either the solution operator directly or, in the interest of computational efficiency, for a randomly "sketched" version of it. Our other "hybrid" approaches are more innovative, combining rational-approximation-assisted root-finding with approximation using radial basis functions. Three key features of our methods are that (i) they are agnostic of the strategy used to discretize the scattering problem, (ii) they do not require any computations involving non-real wavenumbers, and (iii) they can adjust to different settings through the use of adaptive sampling strategies. We carry out some numerical experiments involving 2D scatterers to compare our approaches. In our tests, two of our approaches (one standard, one hybrid) emerge as the best performers, with one or the other being preferable, depending on whether emphasis is placed on accuracy or efficiency.</description>

      <title>A filtered Lie splitting method for the Zakharov system with low regularity estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an error estimate for the filtered Lie splitting scheme applied to the Zakharov system, characterized by solutions exhibiting very low regularity across all dimensions. Our findings are derived from the application of multilinear estimates established within the framework of discrete Bourgain spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the solution $(E,z,z_t) \in H^{s+r+1/2}\times H^{s+r}\times H^{s+r-1}$, the error in $H^{r+1/2}\times H^{r}\times H^{r-1}$ is $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{s/2})$ for $s\in(0,2]$, where $r=\max(0,\frac d2-1)$. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first explicit error estimate for the splitting method based on the original Zakharov system, as well as the first instance where low regularity error estimates for coupled equations have been considered within the Bourgain framework. Furthermore, numerical experiments confirm the validity of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Stochastic Inverse Problems via Variational Bayesian Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayesian inversion method demonstrates significant potential for solving inverse problems, enabling both point estimation and uncertainty quantification. However, Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation may become unstable when handling data from diverse distributions (e.g., solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs)). Additionally, Monte Carlo sampling methods are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage optimization method based on optimal control theory and variational Bayesian methods. This method not only achieves stable solutions for stochastic inverse problems but also efficiently quantifies the uncertainty of the solutions. In the first stage, we introduce a new weighting formulation to ensure the stability of the Bayesian MAP estimation. In the second stage, we derive the necessary condition to efficiently quantify the uncertainty of the solutions, by combining the new weighting formula with variational inference. Furthermore, we establish an error estimation theorem that relates the exact solution to the optimally estimated solution under different amounts of observed data. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models based on transformer architectures have become integral to state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. However, their training remains computationally expensive and exhibits instabilities, some of which are expected to be caused by finite-precision computations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of round-off errors within the forward pass of a transformer architecture which yields fundamental bounds for these effects. In addition, we conduct a series of numerical experiments which demonstrate the practical relevance of our bounds. Our results yield concrete guidelines for choosing hyperparameters that mitigate round-off errors, leading to more robust and stable inference.</description>

      <title>A rotation-based geometrically nonlinear spectral Reissner--Mindlin shell element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a geometrically nonlinear spectral shell element based on Reissner--Mindlin kinematics using a rotation-based formulation with additive update of the discrete nodal rotation vector. The formulation is provided in matrix notation in detail. The use of a director vector, as opposed to multi-parameter shell models, significantly reduces the computational cost by minimizing the number of degrees of freedom. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of the spectral element method (SEM) in combination with Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature regarding the computational costs to generate the element stiffness matrix. To assess the performance of the new formulation for large deformation analysis, we compare it to three other numerical methods. One of these methods is a non-isoparametric SEM shell using the geometry definition of isogeometric analysis (IGA), while the other two are IGA shell formulations which differ in the rotation interpolation. All formulations base on Rodrigues' rotation tensor. Through the solution of various challenging numerical examples, it is demonstrated that although IGA benefits from an exact geometric representation, its influence on solution accuracy is less significant than that of shape function characteristics and rotational formulations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed SEM shell, despite its simpler rotational formulation, can produce results comparable to the most accurate and complex version of IGA. Finally, we discuss the optimal SEM strategy, emphasizing the effectiveness of employing coarser meshes with higher-order elements.</description>

      <title>Efficient and stable derivative-free Steffensen algorithm for root finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a family of numerical methods, based on the Steffensen divided difference iterative algorithm, that do not evaluate the derivative of the objective functions. The family of methods achieves second-order convergence with two function evaluations per iteration with marginal additional computational cost. An important side benefit of the method is the improvement in stability for different initial conditions compared to the vanilla Steffensen method.

      <title>Sediment Concentration Estimation via Multiscale Inverse Problem and Stochastic Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we contribute to the broader understanding of inverse problems by introducing a versatile multiscale modeling framework tailored to the challenges of sediment concentration estimation. Specifically, we propose a novel approach for sediment concentration measurement in water flow, modeled as a multiscale inverse medium problem. To address the multiscale nature of the sediment distribution, we treat it as an inhomogeneous random field and use the homogenization theory in deriving the effective medium model. The inverse problem is formulated as the reconstruction of the effective medium model, specifically, the sediment concentration, from partial boundary measurements. Additionally, we develop numerical algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of solving this inverse problem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods in producing accurate sediment concentration estimates, offering new insights into sediment concentration measurement in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and numerical methods for understanding immune cell motion during wound healing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new workflow to analyze macrophage motion during wound healing. These immune cells are attracted to the wound after an injury and they move showing both directional and random motion. Thus, first, we smooth the trajectories and we separate the random from the directional parts of the motion. The smoothing model is based on curve evolution where the curve motion is influenced by the smoothing term and the attracting term. Once we obtain the random sub-trajectories, we analyze them using the mean squared displacement to characterize the type of diffusion. Finally, we compute the velocities on the smoothed trajectories and use them as sparse samples to reconstruct the wound attractant field. To do that, we consider a minimization problem for the vector components and lengths, which leads to solving the Laplace equation with Dirichlet conditions for the sparse samples and zero Neumann boundary conditions on the domain boundary.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin discretization of conservative dynamical low-rank approximation schemes for the Vlasov-Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) scheme for the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation is presented. Based on the formulation of the DLRA equations as Friedrichs' systems in a continuous setting, it combines recently proposed conservative DLRA methods with a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. The resulting scheme is shown to ensure mass and momentum conservation at the discrete level. In addition, a new formulation of the conservative integrator is proposed which facilitates a projector splitting integrator. Numerical experiments validate our approach in one- and two-dimensional simulations of Landau damping. As a demonstration of feasibility, it is also shown that the rank-adaptive unconventional integrator can be combined with mesh adaptivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with constructing an invariant-domain preserving approximation technique for the compressible Euler equations that preserves the minimum principle on the physical entropy. We show that any numerical method that can be written as a convex combination of good auxiliary states will satisfy the minimum principle on the physical entropy provided the equation of state satisfies some mild assumptions. Furthermore, we derive a wave speed estimate in an extended Riemann problem necessary for constructing the auxiliary states with desired properties. Finally, we numerically illustrate the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Computing the Saturation Throughput for Heterogeneous p-CSMA in a General Wireless Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known expression for the saturation throughput of heterogeneous transmitting nodes in a wireless network using p-CSMA, derived from Renewal Theory, implicitly assumes that all transmitting nodes are in range of, and therefore conflicting with, each other. This expression, as well as simple modifications of it, does not correctly capture the saturation throughput values when an arbitrary topology is specified for the conflict graph between transmitting links. For example, we show numerically that calculations based on renewal theory can underestimate throughput by 48-62% for large packet sizes when the conflict graph is represented by a star topology. This is problematic because real-world wireless networks, such as wireless IoT mesh networks, are often deployed over a large area, resulting in non-complete conflict graphs.
  To address this gap, we present a computational approach based on a novel Markov chain formulation that yields the exact saturation throughput for each node in the general network case for any given set of access probabilities, as well as a more compact expression for the special case where the packet length is twice the slot length. Using our approach, we show how the transmit probabilities could be optimized to maximize weighted utility functions of the saturation throughput values. This would allow a wireless system designer to set transmit probabilities to achieve desired throughput trade-offs in any given deployment.</description>

      <title>A Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for Efficient Simulation of Power Systems with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As inverter-based resources (IBRs) penetrate power systems, the dynamics become more complex, exhibiting multiple timescales, including electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics of power electronic controllers and electromechanical dynamics of synchronous generators. Consequently, the power system model becomes highly stiff, posing a challenge for efficient simulation using existing methods that focus on dynamics within a single timescale. This paper proposes a Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for highly efficient multi-timescale simulation of a power system represented by its EMT model. The new method alternates between the microscopic EMT model of the system and an automatically reduced macroscopic model, varying the step size accordingly to achieve significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy in both fast and slow dynamics of interests. It also incorporates a semi-analytical solution method to enable a more adaptive variable-step mechanism. The new simulation method is illustrated using a two-area system and is then tested on a detailed EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>PI-Controlled Variable Time-Step Power System Simulation Using an Adaptive Order Differential Transformation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic simulation plays a crucial role in power system transient stability analysis, but traditional numerical integration-based methods are time-consuming due to the small time step sizes. Other semi-analytical solution methods, such as the Differential Transformation method, often struggle to select proper orders and steps, leading to slow performance and numerical instability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive dynamic simulation approach for power system transient
  stability analysis. The approach adds feedback control and optimization to selecting the step and order, utilizing the Differential Transformation method and a proportional-integral control strategy to control truncation errors. Order selection is formulated as an optimization problem resulting in a variable-step-optimal-order method that achieves significantly larger time step sizes without violating numerical stability. It is applied to three systems: the IEEE 9-bus, 3-generator system, IEEE 39-bus, 10-generator system, and a Polish 2383-bus, 327-generator system, promising computational efficiency and numerical robustness for large-scale power system is demonstrated in comprehensive case studies.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of Discretely Sampled Stochastic Policies in Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic policies are widely used in continuous-time reinforcement learning algorithms. However, executing a stochastic policy and evaluating its performance in a continuous-time environment remain open challenges. This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a policy execution framework that samples actions from a stochastic policy at discrete time points and implements them as piecewise constant controls. We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we show that the same convergence rates hold with high probability concerning the sampling noise, and further establish a $1/2$-order almost sure convergence when the volatility is not controlled. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations. Our results provide theoretical justification for the exploratory stochastic control framework in [H. Wang, T. Zariphopoulou, and X.Y. Zhou, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21 (2020), pp. 1-34].</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with shape irregularity issues in discrete topology optimization algorithms whereby the design is created using the automated distribution of material in the design region. Graph theory is employed to derive appropriate regularity measures for any discrete optimization algorithm. Shape regularity is quantified by scalar figures ready to evaluate design choices in the form of Pareto-frontiers. Developed metrics deal with information concerning material usage, problematic distribution, and features that complicate manufacturing. The theory is verified by several examples demonstrating the treatment of isolated islands of materials, point connections between material segments, or homogeneity.</description>

Abstract: This article proposes numerically robust algorithms for Gaussian state estimation with singular observation noise. Our approach combines a series of basis changes with Bayes' rule, transforming the singular estimation problem into a nonsingular one with reduced state dimension. In addition to ensuring low runtime and numerical stability, our proposal facilitates marginal-likelihood computations and Gauss-Markov representations of the posterior process. We analyse the proposed method's computational savings and numerical robustness and validate our findings in a series of simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.03716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two a posteriori error estimators for the virtual element method (VEM) based on global and local flux reconstruction in the spirit of [5]. The proposed error estimators are reliable and efficient for the $h$-, $p$-, and $hp$-versions of the VEM. This solves a partial limitation of our former approach in [6], which was based on solving local nonhybridized mixed problems. Differently from the finite element setting, the proof of the efficiency turns out to be simpler, as the flux reconstruction in the VEM does not require the existence of polynomial, stable, divergence right-inverse operators. Rather, we only need to construct right-inverse operators in virtual element spaces, exploiting only the implicit definition of virtual element functions. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical experiments on a benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>On Phase Unwrapping via Digital Wavefront Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a new class of methods for the classic 2D phase unwrapping problem of recovering a phase function from its wrapped form. For this, we consider the wrapped phase as a wavefront aberration in an optical system, and use reconstruction methods for (digital) wavefront sensors for its recovery. The key idea is that mathematically, common wavefront sensors are insensitive to whether an incoming wavefront is wrapped or not. However, typical reconstructors for these sensors are optimized to compute smooth wavefronts. Thus, digitally "propagating" a wrapped phase through such a sensor and then applying one of these reconstructors results in a smooth unwrapped phase. First, we show how this principle can be applied to derive phase unwrapping algorithms based on digital Shack-Hartmann and Fourier-type wavefront sensors. Then, we numerically test our approach on an unwrapping problem appearing in a free-space optical communications project currently under development, and compare the results to those obtained with other state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing low-rank approximations of kernel matrices is an important problem with many applications in scientific computing and data science. We propose methods to efficiently approximate and store low-rank approximations to kernel matrices that depend on certain hyperparameters. The main idea behind our method is to use multivariate Chebyshev function approximation along with the tensor train decomposition of the coefficient tensor. The computations are in two stages: an offline stage, which dominates the computational cost and is parameter-independent, and an online stage, which is inexpensive and instantiated for specific hyperparameters. A variation of this method addresses the case that the kernel matrix is symmetric and positive semi-definite. The resulting algorithms have linear complexity in terms of the sizes of the kernel matrices. We investigate the efficiency and accuracy of our method on parametric kernel matrices induced by various kernels, such as the Mat\'ern kernel, through various numerical experiments. Our methods have speedups up to $200\times$ in the online time compared to other methods with similar complexity and comparable accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a structure preserving non-conforming finite element approximation scheme for the bi-harmonic wave maps into spheres equation. It satisfies a discrete energy law and preserves the non-convex sphere constraint of the continuous problem. The discrete sphere constraint is enforced at the mesh-points via a discrete Lagrange multiplier. This approach restricts the spatial approximation to the (non-conforming) linear finite elements. We show that the numerical approximation converges to the weak solution of the continuous problem in spatial dimension $d=1$. The convergence analysis in dimensions $d&gt;1$ is complicated by the lack of a discrete product rule as well as the low regularity of the numerical approximation in the non-conforming setting. Hence, we show convergence of the numerical approximation in higher-dimensions by introducing additional stabilization terms in the numerical approximation. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed numerical approximation and to illustrate the regularizing effect of the bi-Laplacian which prevents the formation of singularities.</description>

      <title>A hybrid finite element/finite difference method for reconstruction of dielectric properties of conductive objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present a hybrid finite element/finite difference method which is used for reconstructions of electromagnetic properties within a realistic breast phantom. This is done by studying the mentioned properties' (electric permittivity and conductivity in this case) representing coefficients in a constellation of Maxwell's equations. This information is valuable since these coefficient can reveal types of tissues within the breast, and in applications could be used to detect shapes and locations of tumours.
  Because of the ill-posed nature of this coefficient inverse problem, we approach it as an optimization problem by introducing the corresponding Tikhonov functional and in turn Lagrangian. These are then minimized by utilizing an interplay between finite element and finite difference methods for solutions of direct and adjoint problems, and thereafter by applying a conjugate gradient method to an adaptively refined mesh.</description>

      <title>Some Extremal Symmetric Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04837v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}_{n,d} := \mathbb{R}[x_1$,$\ldots$, $x_n]_d$ be the set of all the homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$, and let $\mathcal{H}_{n,d}^s := \mathcal{H}_{n,d}^{\mathfrak{S}_n}$ be the subset of all the symmetric polynomials. For a semialgebraic subset of $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and a vector subspace $\mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{H}_{n,d}$, we define a PSD cone $\mathcal{P}(A$, $\mathcal{H})$ by $\mathcal{P}(A$, $\mathcal{H}) := \big\{f \in \mathcal{H}$ $\big|$ $f(a) \geq 0$ ($\forall a \in A$)$\big\}$. In this article, we study a family of extremal symmetric polynomials of $\mathcal{P}_{3,6} := \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathcal{H}_{3,6})$ and that of $\mathcal{P}_{4,4} := \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^4$, $\mathcal{H}_{4,4})$. We also determine all the extremal polynomials of $\mathcal{P}_{3,5}^{s+} := \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}_+^3$, $\mathcal{H}_{3,5}^s)$ where $\mathbb{R}_+ := \big\{ x \in \mathbb{R}$, $x \geq 0 \big\}$. Some of them provide extremal polynomials of $\mathcal{P}_{3,10}$.</description>

      <title>Rigorous enclosure of Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a powerful and general method to provide rigorous and accurate upper and lower bounds for Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows. Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system, work under mild hypoellipticity conditions and outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far out of reach from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of three different systems. Finally, we show the robustness of our approach by combining it with continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents over large parameter regions.</description>
