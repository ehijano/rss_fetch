      <title>Completeness from Gravitational Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that symmetry in the presence of gravity implies a version of the completeness hypothesis. For a broad class of theories, we demonstrate that the existence of finitely many charged particles logically necessitates the existence of infinitely many charged particles populating the entire charge lattice. Our conclusions follow from the consistency of perturbative gravitational scattering and require the following ingredients: 1) a weakly coupled ultraviolet completion of gravity, 2) a nonabelian symmetry $G$, gauged or global, whose Cartan subgroup generates the abelian charge lattice, and 3) a spectrum containing some finite set of charged representations, in the simplest cases taken to be a single particle in the fundamental. Under these conditions, the abelian charge lattice is completely filled by single-particle states for $G=SO(N)$ with $N\geq 5$ and $G=SU(N)$ with $N\geq 3$, which in turn implies completeness for other symmetry groups such as $Spin(N)$, $Sp(N)$, and $E_8$. Curiously, a corollary of our results is that the $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ grand unified theories have precisely the minimal field content needed to derive completeness using our methodology.</description>

      <title>Classifying GNY-like models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic classification of (2+1)d Gross--Neveu--Yukawa-like models built out of one or more 4-component Dirac fermions and $M$ scalar fields, which preserve an O($M$) symmetry rotating the scalars. We then identify the perturbative fixed points of these models in the $4-\epsilon$ expansion. Our classification highlights several targets for the conformal bootstrap and reveals a new fixed point with $M=3$, which we call the "orthogonal Heisenberg" CFT.</description>

      <title>Random matrix product state models of gravitationally prepared states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally prepared states are quantum field theoretic states prepared by gravitational path integrals with spatial boundaries that have fixed boundary conditions for gravity but not for matter fields. They can be interpreted as quantum field theoretic states of closed universes encoding quantum gravitational effects of the past. We propose a method of modelling gravitationally prepared states in two dimensions with random matrix product states (RMPS). Such RMPS models allow us to exactly define and compute contributions of higher topologies and replica geometries in the gravitationally prepared state to all orders. We show that the bra-ket wormhole phase transition, a crucial physical property of gravitationally prepared states, is ensured if the transfer matrix of the RMPS satisfies the spectral gapping property, which we define, and define a class of models called $\mathrm{O}(k)$ models satisfying this property. A novel advantage of RMPS models is that they allow us to compute the effects of off-shell wormholes, i.e., wormhole topologies without semiclassical solutions. In particular, using RMPS models, we find that off-shell wormholes lead to nonzero long-distance correlators in gravitationally prepared states. We also define RMPS models in continuous space, and discuss implications for studying de Sitter gravitationally prepared states.</description>

      <title>Anomalies on ALE spaces and phases of gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that certain 't~Hooft anomalies that evade detection on commonly used closed four-dimensional manifolds become visible when a quantum field theory is placed on asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. As a concrete example, we use the Eguchi-Hanson (EH) space, whose defining features are its nontrivial second cohomology generated by the self-intersecting two-sphere and its asymptotic boundary $\mathbb{RP}^3$, which carries torsion and thus furnishes additional cohomological data absent on conventional backgrounds. For a theory with symmetry $G_1\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $\eta$-invariant associated with the $\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries.</description>

      <title>Mixed signals in the IR: Positivity bounds with indefinite species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theories with multiple particle species standard fixed-t positivity bounds do not directly apply to 2-to-2 definite species scattering amplitudes when the initial and final state are not the same (inelastic processes). These inelastic amplitudes are nevertheless constrained by positivity bounds indirectly, by considering scattering states which are arbitrary superpositions of definite species two-particle states. While these `superposition bounds' have been studied and utilised extensively in the past, earlier analyses typically consider cases insensitive to relative particle masses and IR branch cuts. Here we derive new families of bounds that take account and depend explicitly on mass differences between species making no assumption of weak-coupling. We emphasise unusual non-analyticities induced by the IR mass difference within the superposition amplitude and use fixed (backwards) angle dispersion relations to prove our bounds. We then discuss extensions of our results to `improved bounds', with implications worth exploring for pions and other EFTs of the Standard Model and Beyond, particularly where IR branch cuts are non-negligible.</description>

      <title>On the gravitational partition function under volume constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean action serves as a bridge between gravitational thermodynamics and the partition function. In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After reviewing the development of 10D, superspace theories, and their relations to superstring and heterotic string theories, explicit calculations are undertaken in the on-shell $\cal N$ = 1 linearized supergravity, the associated super-current is derived, and non-closure terms are explicitly given. The $L_{\rm I}$ and $R_{\rm I}$ adjacency matrices are then computed in complete numerical form as data sets. This is the preliminary step required to perform a scan to embed the on-shell matrices into off-shell ones.</description>

      <title>The tunneling decay rate in QFT beyond the thin wall approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunneling decay rate per unit volume in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), at order $\hbar$, is given by $\Gamma/V = Ae^{-B}$, where $B$ is the Euclidean action evaluated at the so-called bounce, and $A$ is proportional to the determinant of a second-order differential operator. The dominant contribution comes from the exponential factor. To estimate $\Gamma/V$, one must determine the bounce configuration, which satisfies a highly nonlinear equation. A common approach in the literature is the thin-wall approximation. In this work, we extend the formalism to cases where the thin-wall approximation is not valid. We employ a simple variational method to estimate both the bounce and the decay rate, and we find good agreement between our results and full numerical calculations.</description>

Abstract: We argue that modular classes of Q-manifolds provide an efficient method for addressing the existence of supersymmetric Berezin volumes in the supergeometric representation theory of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ $d=1$ supertranslation algebra. We establish a cohomological coherence criterion for the existence of a Berezin volume that is invariant under both of the supercharges.</description>

      <title>Complete Topological Quantization of Higher Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher-dimensional supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology, the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables and quantum states of solitonic field histories are completely determined through a topological form of light-front quantization. We survey the logic of this construction and expand on aspects of the quantization argument.
  In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) dimensionally reduced to 3D, a suitable choice of flux quantization in Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis h") recovers this way the fine detail of the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) quantum observables of abelian Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall systems.
  An analogous choice ("Hypothesis H") of global completion of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the higher gauge sector of 11D SuGra) realizes various aspects of the topological sector of the conjectural "M-theory" and its M5-branes.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dispersion Spectra across Lorentz boosted frames: Spurious modes and the enigma of causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of linearized perturbations in relativistic field theories involving derivative corrections frequently leads to pathologies that, although generic, may not always be manifest, like in a local rest frame scenario. Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the expectation values of null polygonal Wilson loops computed in planar \(\mathcal{N}=4\) super Yang-Mills theory are dual to MHV amplitudes in that theory, and moreover that the duality can be extended to higher helicity sectors through the introduction of super Wilson loops. In this first of a series of papers, we investigate the natural generalisation posed by correlation functions of multiple light-like loop operators, both in the bosonic case and in the case of super Wilson loops. Explicit calculations are presented in several cases and we verify that, in the Abelian theory, these objects obey a natural generalisation of the \(\bar{Q}\)-equation which relates different loop orders, kinematic configurations and Grassmann sectors.</description>

Abstract: Reviving the old proposal of describing gravity as a gauge theory first we describe the construction of the Conformal and the Noncommutative (Fuzzy) Gravities in a gauge-theoretic manner. Then stressing the fact that the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions, we show how the above Gravities can be unified with the Internal Interactions, the latter based on the GUT $SO(10)$.</description>

      <title>Fortuity and relevant deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the supercharge cohomology of an $\mathcal{N}=1$ relevant deformation of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. By introducing a field redefinition, we integrate out massive fields in a cohomological sense. Then, we construct the monotone cohomologies corresponding to the Kaluza-Klein particles of the dual supergravity solution. Some of the monotone cohomologies obey stringy exclusion principle analogous to that of $AdS_3$. Relatedly, they vanish on the diagonal field configurations, unlike $\mathcal{N}=4$ monotone cohomologies. We also construct infinitely many fortuitous cohomologies for gauge group SU(2). We find that unlike $\mathcal{N}=4$ fortuitous cohomologies, they can either be non-vanishing or vanishing on the diagonal fields. By undoing the field redefinition and taking a suitable UV limit, we show that non-vanishing ones reduce to monotone cohomologies of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, while vanishing ones reduce to fortuitous cohomologies of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. This implies that the fortuity can arise due to the relevant deformation, while monotonicity is not.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize Vasiliev's higher-spin gravity theory in 3d into $\mathcal{N} = (0, 2)$ case, by which we mean that the asymptotic symmetry of such a gravity theory have the structure of 2d $\mathcal{N} = (0, 2)$ superconformal algebra. While the construction is limited to linearized level, asymptotic symmetry and possible matter content of such theories is discussed. Also, the 1-loop partition function of this theory around thermal Euclidean AdS space-time, with different matter fields, is calculated by heat-kernel method.</description>

      <title>Higher dimensional holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic dictionary is well developed for gravity in asymptotically anti de Sitter $A(AdS_{d+1})$ spacetimes. However, this approach is limited, since many physically relevant configurations, such as bubbling geometries dual to heavy operators, do not arise as an uplift of a lower dimensional $A(AdS_{d+1})$ solution. Instead, they are intrinsic solutions of ten- or eleven-dimensional supergravity. In this work, we address this problem by evaluating the on-shell Type IIB supergravity action, with a suitable boundary counterterm, on the bubbling solutions describing half-BPS surface operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. This calculation exactly reproduces the surface operator Euler conformal anomaly, an observable known exactly in the field theory but previously inaccessible holographically. This example illustrates the need for a higher-dimensional approach to holographic renormalization applicable to general asymptotically $AdS_{d+1} \times M_q$ geometries.</description>

      <title>Universal Supercritical Behavior in Global Monopole-Charged AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12723v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Widom line and universal supercritical crossover for charged AdS black holes threaded by a global monopole. We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate how methods from Landau analysis that have been developed for studying the properties of massive Feynman integrals in momentum space can be generalized to massless integrals. We consider integrals with both massive and massless propagators in arbitrary dimensions, paying attention to square root branch points. By focusing on a number of well-chosen examples, we show how resolution of singularities (via blow-ups or complex structure deformation) can be used to predict how the behavior of these integrals is modified as different numbers of propagators are chosen to be massless.</description>

      <title>Relation between leading divergences in nonrenormalizable $4D$ supersymmetric theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an ${\cal N}=1$ nonrenormalizable supersymmetric gauge theory with the superpotential quartic in the chiral matter superfields. With the help of the Slavnov's higher covariant derivative regularization it is demonstrated that (in the lowest nontrivial order) the leading power divergent quantum correction to the gauge coupling constant is given by an integral of double total derivatives with respect to the loop momenta. The result obtained after calculating this integral turned out to be proportional to the corresponding quantum correction to the kinetic term of the matter superfields. More exactly, in the considered approximation the quadratically divergent contributions to the gauge coupling and to the kinetic term of the chiral matter superfields are related by an equation analogous to the exact NSVZ $\beta$-function for the renormalizable case.</description>

      <title>Holographic Codes from Enriched Link Entanglement in Spin Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an enriched entanglement structure for spin networks, inspired by tensor-network constructions, in which internal links can carry a controlled and discrete amount of entanglement. In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Amplitudes from Cubic Scalar Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman diagrams are the foremost tool in the perturbative study of quantum field theory. In gauge theories, the full potential of this tool is revealed when it is combined with the Slavanov-Taylor identities associated with the local gauge symmetry. Hence, it is desirable to have perturbative expansion of scattering amplitudes that combine the graphical nature of Feynman diagram expansion and the reations among various diagrams due to the Slavanov-Taylor identities. In a remarkable paper, motivated by the similarity between graph homology and the gauge theory BRST homology, Kreimer, Sars and van Suijlekom found such an expansion. The implication of this expansion is that the amplitudes in a generic non-abelian gauge theory can be constructed by transmuting the renormalised integrands of trivalent Feynman diagrams in a scalar quantum field theory. In this paper, we show that this surprising connection naturally emerges from Witten's open string field theory in the field theory limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a time-crystalline phase in a single-band holographic superconductor, extending the AdS/CFT framework. By incorporating a nonlinear gauge-scalar coupling and external driving, we derive coupled equations of motion for the plasma and Higgs modes, analogous to those in high-Tc superconductors. Multi-scale analysis reveals a sum resonance with subharmonic growth indicating broken time-translation symmetry. We perform numerical computation of quasinormal mode and demonstrate the transition to the time-crystalline phase. The holographic model may serve as a robust tool for studying strongly coupled time crystals.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometry of charged AdS black holes with a string cloud in Lorentz-violating Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic microstructure of electrically charged AdS black holes in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity in the presence of a spherically symmetric cloud of strings. Employing Weinhold and Ruppeiner thermodynamic geometries in complementary thermodynamic representations, we show that curvature singularities consistently track the spinodal boundaries and the second-order critical point associated with a Van der Waals-like small/large black-hole phase transition. Moreover, the sign structure of the Ruppeiner curvature provides a transparent characterization of the competing microscopic interactions across the coexisting phases. We find that the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$ and the string-cloud parameter $\alpha$ shift the critical scales and rescale correlation measures while preserving the universality class of the critical behavior. We further comment on dynamical and holographic implications and contrast the thermodynamic sensitivity to $(\ell,\alpha)$ with thin-disk optical signatures.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of type II orientifold flux vacua in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the study initiated in \cite{Arboleya:2024vnp} and investigate three-dimensional (3D) flux vacua of type II orientifold reductions on twisted tori that include a single type of spacetime-filling O$p$-plane with $\,p=2,\ldots,9$. Restricting to $\textrm{SO}(3)$-invariant setups -- also known as RSTU-models -- and setting axions to zero, we exhaustively chart the landscape of 3D orientifold flux vacua. It consists of $\,56\,$ inequivalent multi-parametric families of AdS$_3$ and Mkw$_3$ flux vacua, all of them without negative masses in the spectrum of scalar fluctuations. Performing T-dualities, all the inequivalent vacua can be found in type IIB with either O9-, O5- or O3-planes. We show that: $i)\,$ type IIB with O$9$ fails to stabilise the volume of the internal space. $ii)\,$ type IIB with O5 realises the only cases of scale-separated AdS$_{3}$ vacua. $iii)\,$ type IIB with O$3$ provides only Mkw$_{3}$ vacua exhibiting a rich variety of supersymmetry-breaking patterns. Assuming that some mechanism (possibly non-perturbative) fixes the unstabilised modulus in type IIB with O$9$, we re-examine the possibility of achieving a weakly-coupled and scale-separated regime.</description>

      <title>Extending Weinberg's EFT: effective scalar-tensor theories up to sixth order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of the six-derivative effective scalar-tensor theories, extending the four-derivative framework previously developed by Steven Weinberg. The on-shell effective field theory comprises five parity-even and three parity-odd independent six-derivative scalar-tensor interactions, representing all inequivalent deformations consistent with general covariance. We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime. The six-derivative Lagrangian constructed here provides the next-to-leading-order extension of scalar-tensor gravity, furnishing a robust framework for exploring quantum or stringy corrections, parity-violating interactions, and strong-curvature effects in cosmology, black hole physics and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Feynman diagrams in AdS$_2$ space can be decomposed into infinite series of matrix elements of Wilson line network operators. The case of the 3-point scalar Feynman diagram with endpoints in the bulk is studied in detail. The resulting decomposition is similar to the conformal block decomposition of Witten diagrams, i.e. it comprises a single-trace term and infinite sums of double-trace terms. We derive a number of AdS propagator identities which relate the standard bulk-to-bulk propagators with the modified bulk-to-bulk propagators of two different types responsible for extracting single-trace and double-trace terms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the quantization of a free scalar in 4-dimensional (4d) Lorentzian Anti-de-Sitter spacetime (AdS$_4$). We derive solutions to the wave equation that diagonalize time translations in a foliation of AdS$_4$ with null cones. We show that time-translation eigenmodes of arbitrary mass fields that admit a flat space limit must contain both normalizable and non-normalizable fall-offs as one approaches the boundary along a null leaf. We then show that AdS bulk-to-boundary propagators with suitable time orderings provide alternative bases of solutions to the wave equation. We propose an AdS bulk reconstruction formula relating an on-shell free scalar at a spacetime point to CFT primary operators and their shadow transforms. In the flat space limit, this formula reduces to the Carrollian expansion of a free field in flat space. We finally construct Lorentz boost eigenfunctions in AdS in both hyperbolic and null foliations and show that they respectively become massive and massless conformal primary wavefunctions in the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating equilibrium with slow steady flow and the correct form of entropy current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with spherical symmetry as well as with steady energy flow is investigated perturbatively around the hydrostatic limit, where the radial component of the fluid velocity field $u^\mu$ is sufficiently small. Each component of vectors and tensors consisting of the system is expanded in different powers, which makes the covariant perturbation approach ineffective. The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^\mu$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^\mu$ in such a general covariant form that $s^\mu=au^\mu+ bj^\mu$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^\mu=(s-bj^0)u^\mu/u^0+ bj^\mu$, where $s$ is the entropy density. The remaining parameter $b$ is fixed by the current conservation equation. The perturbative analysis shows that $b$ starts with the quadratic order and its leading term is determined explicitly.</description>

      <title>From DGLAP to Sudakov: Precision Predictions for Energy-Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations in the distribution of energy produced in collider experiments provide a snapshot of the microscopic dynamics of QCD, and its evolution from asymptotically free quarks and gluons, to confined hadrons. There has recently been considerable progress in the interpretation and precision calculation of these correlations, using a specific class of observables called energy correlators (EECs). These observables are most cleanly studied in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where they can be measured over their full angular range. Of particular interest are kinematic limits of the correlator, both collinear, and back-to-back, where the correlator exhibits scaling behaviors governed by specific operators in QCD. Resolving these scalings requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, which can be achieved by performing measurements on tracks (charged particles). In this paper we perform the first calculation of the track-based EEC over its entire kinematic range, achieving a record precision of of NNLL (collinear) + NNLO (fixed order) + NNNNLL (back-to-back) for the track-based EEC, and additionally incorporate the leading non-perturbative corrections and their resummation, including the Collins-Soper kernel computed using lattice QCD. We describe the breadth of physics probed by this observable, and highlight the impact of different components of our factorization theorem on the final distribution. Combined with recent measurements of the track-based EEC with archival LEP data, our calculation initiates the precision study of track-based observables at LEP, which will lead to new insights into the dynamics of QCD, and the precision extraction of its underlying parameters.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Kondo Effect in Superconducting Leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional multichannel Kondo effect takes place when several gapless metallic electronic channels interact with a localized spin-$S$ impurity, with the number of channels $n$ exceeding the size of the impurity spin, $n&gt;2S$, leading to the emergence of non-Fermi liquid impurity behavior at low temperatures. Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln[2\cos(\pi/(n+2))]$. In the YSR and unscreened phases on the other hand the impurity entropy exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence and is effectively free at low temperatures with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln 2$.</description>

      <title>Born-Infeld signatures in AdS black hole thermodynamics and gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Born-Infeld-Anti-de Sitter (EBI-AdS) black holes (BHs). Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $\eta \sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units. The plasma deflection analysis reveals frequency-dependent refractive modifications encoded in the plasma parameter, offering additional possible observational channels.</description>

      <title>Fermi Liquid Fixed Point Deformations due to Codimension Two Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that codimension-two defects in Fermi liquids deform the renormalization group flow via a marginally relevant coupling. The mechanism for generating the flow is distinct from the case of the Kondo problem (codimension-three defects) in that the effective particle-hole asymmetry that leads to the log running is due to the spatial anisotropy generated by the defect. The mechanism for the log generation has a simple geometric explanation which shows that hole fluctuations are suppressed as the incoming momentum is taken to be along the direction of the defect. The RG flow time is shown to scale with the length of the defect. We also show that the dislon, the Goldstone mode localized to the defect, couples in a non-derivative fashion to the bulk fermions and becomes relevant above the dislons' Debye frequency which depends upon the defect tension.</description>

      <title>New Massless Spectra from Cosmic String Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard picture of cosmic strings, cusps are generic features of Nambu-Goto loops where the string momentarily reaches the speed of light. They have a characteristic sharp profile, following $y \sim x^{2/3}$ in the $(x,y)$ plane, and produce strong gravitational-wave (GW) bursts with frequency-domain strain $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-4/3}$, making them key targets for current and future GW searches. However, under certain conditions, this generic picture can differ. We identify cusp solutions with different, including smooth, shapes, and compute their massless GW and axion spectra. We derive a general expression for all possible Nambu-Goto cusp spectra with the asymptotic form $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-n/(2n-1)} \omega^{-m/(2m-1)}$ where $n, m\geq 2$. We investigate the effect of realistic corrections to the Nambu-Goto description, such as those from backreaction and finite string width, which introduce a high frequency cutoff.</description>

      <title>Inflation with Gauss-Bonnet Correction and Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological inflation for the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the Higgs potential function and the Gauss-Bonnet term coupled with the Higgs scalar field through a dilaton-like coupling. Then, using the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and considering the appropriate slow-roll parameters, we derive the necessary equations of motion. In the proposed model, since the e-folding integral cannot be easily solved analytically, we first utilize a well-known Taylor expansion. Then, with a certain range of values derived for the model parameters, utilizing a mixture of several diagrams and numerical analysis methods, we obtain results for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the scalar spectral index that are in good agreement with observational data within the acceptable range of the e-folding values. Also, in the absence of the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that the inflationary observables are roughly the same as the predictions of the chaotic inflation model.</description>

      <title>Gluon Gravitational $ D$-Form Factor: The $\sigma$-Meson as a Dilaton Confronted with Lattice Data II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gluon gravitational form factors of the $\pi$, $N$, $\rho$, and $\Delta$ using lattice QCD data at $m_\pi \approx 450 \text{MeV}$ and $m_\pi \approx 170 \text{MeV}$. We base the analysis on fits to a simple $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, supplemented by a polynomial background term. The fitted residues agree with predictions from dilaton effective theory, in which the $\sigma$-meson acts as the dilaton, the pseudo Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. We derive new dilaton-based predictions for the $\rho$- and $\Delta$-gravitational form factors, and comment on the $\eta_{c}$- and $\eta_b$-form factors in the context of the dilaton interpretation. These results reinforce our earlier findings, based on lattice total (quark and gluon) gravitational form factors, and provide further evidence that QCD dynamics may be governed by an infrared fixed point.</description>

      <title>Equation of the Perfect Fluid in the FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the equation of state and its properties of the perfect fluid in the $D$-dimensional FRW universe under Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. In Einstein gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has no critical point in the $P$-$V$ diagram, but its isothermal lines have minima in the $4$-dimensional case and are always negative in higher dimensions. In Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has a critical point in the $5,6,7,8$-dimensional cases with phase transitions above the critical temperature. In Lovelock gravity, we get the equation of state and conditions of the critical points. Our work shows that both the theories of gravity and the dimensions of the FRW universe affect the existence of the critical point of the perfect fluid. Interestingly, if the critical point exists, phase transition always occures above the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Spacetime and the Kerr/CFT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the Kerr/CFT correspondence for extremal Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (Kerr--BR) black holes, which are exact stationary solutions of the Einstein--Maxwell equations describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform Bertotti--Robinson electromagnetic universe. After reviewing the geometry, horizon structure, and thermodynamics of the Kerr--BR family, we demonstrate that the external field non-trivially modifies both the horizon positions and the extremality condition. For extremal configurations, the near-horizon limit yields a warped $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ geometry with an associated Maxwell field aligned to the $U(1)$ fibration. Imposing standard Kerr/CFT boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebra gives rise to a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_L$ and left-moving temperature $T_L$ that depend explicitly on the external field strength. The Cardy formula then reproduces exactly the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr--BR black hole for any admissible value of the Bertotti--Robinson field, thereby establishing a consistent Kerr/CFT dual description. Comparisons with the magnetized Melvin--Kerr and Kaluza--Klein black holes are briefly discussed, highlighting qualitative differences in their curvature profiles and horizon geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize chiral perturbation theory with spinless matter fields in the fundamental representation of ${\rm SU}(N)$ to curved spacetime in the presence of an external gravitational field. This work is motivated by recent interest in investigating energy-momentum tensor matrix elements of matter fields. The complete chiral Lagrangian is constructed, including both minimal extensions from flat spacetime and new curvature-induced terms, up to the next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion, $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We perform a systematic one-loop renormalization of the generating functional using the background field method combined with the heat-kernel technique, and explicitly compute the resulting ultraviolet divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a scalable approach to solving the nuclear shell model, a highly complex and exponentially scaled many-body problem. This work presents a numerical simulation of the subspace search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) combined with an adaptive derivative-assembles pseudo-trotter (ADAPT) ansatz to obtain the low-lying states of any nuclear system in a single optimization run. As an example, we apply this method in this work to a trivial identical nucleon system, two nucleons in the $0p_{3/2}$ orbital, mapped to 4 qubits depicting m-scheme single-particle states including a surface delta effective interaction using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The ADAPT-SSVQE algorithm, by utilizing a symmetry-preserving double-excitation ADAPT operator pool, uniquely optimizes a weighted energy sum, forcing the simultaneous convergence of two lowest states within the total angular momentum $M_J=0$ subspace. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by benchmarking against the exact diagonalization, confirming its potential for probing nuclear structure and pairing phenomena on current and near-future quantum devices without requiring multi-step procedure for excited states.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Perturbations of Hausdorff Dimension in Quantum Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Abbott et al. analyzed the relationship between a particle's trajectory and the resolution of position measurements performed by an observer at fixed time intervals. They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) admits a topological {\theta}-term that violates Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry, yet experimental indicate that {\theta} is nearly zero. To investigate this discrepancy in a controlled setting, we derive the Hamiltonian representation of the QCD Lagrangian and construct its (1+1)-dimensional Schwinger-model analogue. By encoding fermionic and gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using the Jordan-Wigner and quantum-link schemes, we obtain a compact Pauli Hamiltonian that retains the relevant topological vacuum structure. Ground states are prepared using a feedback-based quantum optimization protocol, enabling numerical evaluation of the vacuum energy E0({\theta}) on a few-qubit simulator. Our results show a displaced vacuum at nonzero {\theta}in agreement with strong-interaction expectations, and demonstrate that introducing a dynamical axion field drives the system toward {\theta}= 0, thereby realizing the Peccei-Quinn mechanism within a minimal quantum simulation. These results illustrate how quantum hardware can examine symmetry violation and its dynamical resolution in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using time-averaged radius$-$luminosity relations with 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow \OIII\ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been studied as alternate probes in cosmology due to their large and stable luminosities and broad redshift range. Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\,\textsc{ii} and C\,\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$\beta$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$\beta$ sample of $\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$), whose H$\beta$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\,\AA\, and the broad H$\beta$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\,\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis of a compact object in Rastall-Rainbow gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a horizonless compact object within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow (RR) gravity. Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.
  A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity.</description>

      <title>The heavy quark-antiquark asymmetry in the variable flavor number scheme</title>

Abstract: The twist-2 heavy-quark and antiquark distributions, as defined in the variable flavor number scheme, turn out to be different due to QCD corrections from three-loop onward. This is caused by terms containing the color factor $d_{abc} d^{abc}$ in the heavy-flavor massive pure-singlet operator matrix elements (OMEs) $A^{\rm PS, s, (3)}_{Qq}$ for odd moments in the unpolarized case and for $\Delta A^{\rm PS, s, (3)}_{Qq}$ for even moments in the polarized case. The dependence on the factorization scale of the OMEs is ruled by the anomalous dimensions $\gamma^{\rm NS, s, (2)}_{qq}$ and $\Delta \gamma^{\rm NS, s, (2)}_{qq}$. The polarized calculations are performed in the Larin scheme. We compute the corresponding three-loop heavy-flavor distributions $(\Delta) f_Q(x,Q^2) - (\Delta) f_{\overline{Q}}(x,Q^2)$. Compared to the sum of the heavy-quark and antiquark parton distributions, their difference is small, however, non-vanishing.</description>

      <title>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>The Potential of HEFT and the scale of New Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a geometric framework to compute the leading high-energy behaviour of tree-level scattering amplitudes in theories containing $N$ Nambu-Goldstone bosons and a single Higgs-like scalar with an arbitrary potential $V$. Using these methods, we obtain closed-form expressions for the leading contribution to the full infinite set of tree amplitudes involving any number of Goldstone and Higgs-like external states. These results are then used to derive total cross sections, decay rates, and perturbative unitarity bounds. We then apply our general formalism to the Standard Model scalar sector using the equivalence theorem, working in the regime of small field-space curvature, and use it to characterise the relation between Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We analyse three representative classes of models. Two reproduce previously known behaviours, while the third, based on a dilaton effective theory, exhibits a noteworthy feature within the HEFT framework: a smooth decoupling limit that connects HEFT directly to the Standard Model without passing through a SMEFT regime, providing a possible backdoor to the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrability of Hamiltonians with Time-Dependent Interaction Strengths and the Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider quantum Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strengths, and following the recently formulated generalized Bethe ansatz framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], we show that constraints imposed by integrability take the same form as the renormalization group flow equations corresponding to the respective Hamiltonians with constant interaction strengths. As a concrete example, we consider the anisotropic time-dependent Kondo model characterized by the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$. We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Two-point correlators in de Sitter-prepared states with bra-ket wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the finiteness of de Sitter (dS) horizon entropy, we study how ``bra-ket wormholes'' modify correlation functions in gravitationally prepared states. Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining `time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find a late-time transition in the dominant saddle, accompanied by ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Our results are built upon (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlation at small comoving momentum $k$ by wormhole contribution, and (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance. Although results are qualitatively consistent, one needs to address wormhole stabilization to clearly interpret in terms of the entropy context.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Symmetry in Spherically-symmetric Static Mini-superspaces with Matter Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schr\"odinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schr\"odinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schr\"odinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schr\"odinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schr\"odinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schr\"odinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.02925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the status of the Weyl double copy relation for radiative solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations. We show that all type N vacuum solutions, which describe the radiation region of isolated gravitational systems with appropriate fall-off for the matter fields, admit a degenerate Maxwell field that squares to give the Weyl tensor. This relation defines a scalar that satisfies the wave equation on the background. We show that for non-twisting radiative solutions, the Maxwell field and the scalar also satisfy the Maxwell equation and the wave equation on Minkowski spacetime. Hence, non-twisting solutions have a straightforward double copy interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute scalar three-point celestial amplitudes involving two and three massive scalars. The three-point coefficient of celestial amplitudes with two massive scalars contains a hypergeometric function, and the one with three massive scalars can be represented as a triple Mellin-Barnes integral. Using these three-point celestial amplitudes, we investigate the conformal block expansions of five- and six-point scalar celestial amplitudes in the comb channel. We observe the presence of two-particle operators in the conformal block expansion of five-point celestial amplitudes, which confirms the previous analysis by taking multi-collinear limit. Moreover, we find that there are new three-particle operators in the conformal block expansion of six-point celestial amplitudes. Based on these findings, we conjecture that exchanges of $n$-particle operators can be observed by considering the comb channel conformal block expansion of $(n+3)$-point massless celestial amplitudes. Finally, we show that a new series of operators appears when turning on the mass of the first incoming particle. The leading operator in this series can be interpreted as a two-particle exchange in the OPE of one massive and one massless scalars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the nonperturbative celestial optical theorem from the unitarity of $S$-matrix. This theorem provides a set of nonperturbative bootstrap equations of the conformal partial wave (CPW) coefficients. The celestial optical theorem implies that the imaginary part of CPW coefficient with appropriate conformal dimensions is non-negative. By making certain assumptions and using the celestial optical theorem, we derive nonperturbative results concerning the analytic structure of CPW coefficients. We discover that the CPW coefficients of four massless particles must and only have simple poles located at specific positions. The CPW coefficients involving massive particles exhibit double-trace poles, indicating the existence of double-trace operators in nonperturbative CCFT. It is worth noting that, in contrast to AdS/CFT, the conformal dimensions of double-trace operators do not receive anomalous dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonabelianization map for conformal blocks, which relates $c=1$ Virasoro blocks on a Riemann surface $C$ to Heisenberg blocks on a branched double cover $\widetilde{C}$ of $C$. The nonabelianization map uses the datum of a spectral network on $C$. It gives new formulas for Virasoro blocks in terms of fermion correlation functions determined by the Heisenberg block. The nonabelianization map also intertwines with the action of Verlinde loop operators, and can be used to construct eigenblocks. This leads to new Kyiv-type formulas and regularized Fredholm determinant formulas for $\tau$-functions.</description>

      <title>Proof of the graviton MHV formula using Pleba\'nski's second heavenly equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-dual spacetimes can be thought of as spacetimes containing only positive helicity gravitons. In this work we give a perturbiner expansion for self-dual spacetimes based on Pleba\'nski's second heavenly equation. The expansion is naturally organized as a sum over ``marked tree graphs'' where each node corresponds to a positive helicity graviton and can have an arbitrary number of edges. Negative helicity gravitons must be added in by hand.
  We then use this perturbiner expansion to give a first principles derivation of the NSVW tree formula for the MHV amplitude in Einstein gravity. A unique feature of this proof is that it does not use BCFW recursion or twistor theory. It works by plugging the spacetime with arbitrarily many $+$ gravitons and two $-$ gravitons into the on-shell gravitational action and evaluating it. The action we use is the self-dual Pleba\'nski action plus an additional boundary term, and the amplitude itself comes entirely from the boundary term. Along the way, we also find an interesting new generalization of the NSVW formula which has not previously appeared in the literature.
  In the appendix we give another way to express the perturbiner expansion using binary tree graphs instead of marked tree graphs, and prove the equivalence of these two expansions diagrammatically. We also provide an introduction to self-dual gravity aimed at non-experts, as well as a proof of the Parke-Taylor formula in Yang Mills theory analogous to our proof of the NSVW formula in gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the no-global-symmetry conjecture in quantum gravity by modeling black holes as non-isometric codes that encode the interior states with global charges into the fundamental states. The fluctuation in the inner products of the charged states can be larger compared to the case without charges. The non-isometric map causes states with different charges to have non-zero overlaps, signaling symmetry violation. The Renyi entropies of the radiation with global charges are found to be consistent with the quantum extremal surface formula. We compute various forms of Renyi relative entropy, as well as the fidelity, to quantify the degree of a global symmetry violation in Hawking radiation, demonstrating that global symmetries are indeed violated. We also comment on the instability of the black hole remnant.</description>

Abstract: We study the 2D fermionic SYK model with Majorana fermions, featuring a quartic kinetic term and a $2q$-body interaction with Gaussian disorder. By minimizing the effective action or solving the SD equation for $q=1$, we determine that the appropriate ansatz involves zero spins. Our computation of the Lyapunov exponent shows violations of chaos and unitarity bounds. The gravitational dual corresponds to AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity with a finite radial cut-off, even if we lose the non-zero spins. We also extend the SYK model to higher dimensions while maintaining a similar SD equation in the IR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the holographic prescription for computing the refined R\'enyi entropies $\tilde S_n$ in the $n \to 0$ limit within the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ framework. This limit can be interpreted as a high-temperature regime with respect to the energy defined by the modular Hamiltonian of the state reduced to a subregion. To leading order in $n$, we find that the system attains local equilibrium and admits a CFT description in terms of a Euclidean, irrotational perfect fluid. This fluid exhibits vortex-like boundary conditions at the entangling surface. Guided by this physical picture, we construct an ansatz for the dual geometry in terms of the boundary fluid variables. We show that our anzats solves Einstein's equations coupled to a cosmic brane at leading order in $n$, in agreement with Dong's proposal for the holographic dual to the refined R\'enyi entropy. The resulting conical singularity, signaling the brane's location, can be understood from this perspective as the bulk extension of the boundary fluid vortices.</description>

Abstract: The $\alpha$-vacua are a 1-parameter family of quantum field vacua in de Sitter space which are invariant under the isometry group $SO(1,d)$. In this work give a path integral construction of the de Sitter $\alpha$-vacua. We explain that these states can be prepared by acting on the Bunch-Davies vacuum with a certain non-local charge operator. While most conserved charges live on a single codimension-1 manifold, we show that this particular charge lives on a pair of two codimension-1 manifolds which are antipodal mirrors of each other. The rules for the manipulation of this charge as an insertion in the path integral are explained. We further explain how this charge can be used to solve for the wavefunctionals of the $\alpha$-vacua at $\mathcal{I}^+$ (in the regime that $\alpha$ is small) by deforming the equator of de Sitter space to $\mathcal{I}^+$ / $\mathcal{I}^-$.
  We also discuss the special $\alpha$-vacua known as the ``in'' and ``out'' vacua, for both heavy and light scalars. It is well known that the ``in'' and ``out'' vacua are equal in odd dimensions, but we also show that they are equal in even dimensions when $\sqrt{(d-1)^2/4 - m^2}$ is a half-integer.
  Finally, we investigate the question of whether the $\alpha$-vacua can be constructed in interacting quantum field theories. Using the fact that the antipodal charge operator is only conserved in a free theory, we give a symmetry based argument that in general they cannot be, explaining why interactions and $SO(1,d)$ invariance of the vacua are in tension.</description>

      <title>Localized Gravity, de Sitter, and the Horizon Criterion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing de Sitter-like solutions in string theory remains challenging, prompting speculation about which specific feature might be responsible for their inconsistency in quantum gravity. In this work, we focus on the `Horizon Criterion', which identifies spacetimes as problematic if they exhibit cosmological horizons. In particular, we study the implications for spacetimes with dynamical boundaries. We argue that requiring inertial observers localized on an end-of-the-world (ETW) brane to be in causal contact with every other observer is too restrictive as there exist string-theoretic solutions without this property. Hence, if one does not want to abandon the idea of cosmological horizons being the fundamental issue with de Sitter, a refined condition is needed. The requirement that inertial, boundary-localized observers should be in causal contact with all other observers on the same ETW brane is such an appropriate refinement. We explore the consequences of this criterion for ETW branes whose energy density is governed by a scalar field, considering two cases: First, with a scalar field confined to the ETW brane, and second, with a bulk modulus subject to a brane-localized potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that perturbatively flat vacua (PFVs) introduced in \cite{Demirtas:2019sip} are dual to M-theory compactifications on $G_2$-manifolds, enabling the enumeration of potentially novel $G_2$-manifolds via solutions to Diophantine equations in type IIB flux quanta. Independently, we show that warping corrections to the effective action of type IIB flux vacua grow parametrically at large complex structure, and we demonstrate that these corrections can nonetheless be captured by a classical geometric computation in M-theory.</description>

Abstract: Gauge theories can be solved exactly slightly away from the supersymmetric (SUSY) limit softly broken by anomaly mediation when the size of SUSY breaking is much smaller than the dynamical scale ($m \ll \Lambda$). We show empirical evidence that the near-SUSY limit is continuously connected to the non-SUSY limit ($m \gg \Lambda$) in $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ quarks in the fundamental representation. The evidence includes the behavior of quark bi-linear condensate and gluon condensates, light hadron spectra, and consistency with the large $N_c$ limit. In addition, we present new predictions when $N_f/N_c \gtrsim O(1)$.</description>

      <title>Seeing through the confinement screen: DGLAP/BFKL mixing and light-ray matching in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that collider observables such as hadron number flux can be matched onto a linear combination of detectors/light-ray operators in perturbative QCD. The spectrum of detectors in QCD is subtle, due to recombination between the DGLAP and BFKL trajectories. We explain how to define and renormalize these trajectories at one-loop, systematically incorporating their recombination. The leading and subleading soft gluon theorems play an important role, and our analysis suggests the presence of an infinite series of further subleading soft theorems for squared-amplitudes/form factors. Combined with our light-ray matching hypothesis, the anomalous dimensions of recombined DGLAP/BFKL detectors yield a prediction for the energy dependence of the number of particles in a jet, as well as other predictions for more general energy-weighted hadron measurements. We compare these predictions to Monte-Carlo simulations, finding good agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The contraction map proof method is the commonly used method to prove holographic entropy inequalities. Existence of a contraction map corresponding to a holographic entropy inequality is a sufficient condition for its validity. But is it also necessary? In this note, we answer that question in affirmative for all linear holographic entropy inequalities with rational coefficients. We show that the pre-image of a non-contraction map is not a hypercube, but a proper cubical subgraph, and show that this manifests as alterations to the geodesic structure in the bulk, which leads to the violation of inequalities by holographic geometries obeying the RT formula.</description>

      <title>Correlator Polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, "cosmohedra" have been introduced as polytopes underlying the cosmological wavefunction for conformally coupled Tr($\Phi^3$) theory in FRW cosmologies, generalizing associahedra for flat space scattering amplitudes. In this letter we show that correlation functions are also directly captured by a new polytope - the "Correlatron". The combinatorics of correlation functions is an interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions. This is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher dimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets. We provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural extension of the "shaving" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a byproduct, we also define "graph correlahedra" as polytopes for the contribution to correlators from any fixed graph. We show how the canonical form of these polytopes directly computes the graph correlator, without the power of two weights seen in previous geometric formulations. Finally, we give a prescription for extracting the full correlator from the canonical form of the correlatron.</description>

Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that the two- and three-loop contributions to the partition function of three-dimensional gravity in flat space vanish. This is in agreement with the expected one-loop exactness dictated by the underlying symmetry at the quantum level. To highlight the distinctive nature of the $D=3$ case, we extend the three-loop computation to arbitrary spacetime dimensions $D$. In higher dimensions, the number of contributions increases substantially, reinforcing the view that one-loop exactness is a unique feature of three-dimensional gravity.</description>

      <title>On integrable structure of the null string in (anti-)de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presently integrability turned the key property in the study of duality between superconformal gauge theories and strings in anti-de Sitter superspaces. Complexity of the study of integrable structure in string theory is caused by complicated dependence of background fields of the Type II supergravity multiplets, with which strings interact, on the superspace coordinates. This explains an interest to study of limiting cases, in which superstring equations simplify. In the present work considered is the limiting case of zero tension corresponding to null string. It is obtained the representation in the form of the Lax equation of null-string equations in (anti-)de Sitter space realized as coset manifold. Proposed is twistor interpretation of the Lagrangian of (null) string in anti-de Sitter space expressed in terms of group variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator construction that allows us to represent the lattice Hamiltonians of (abelian or non-abelian) gauge theories in a local and manifestly translation-invariant form. In particular, we use symmetric matrix product states and introduce link-enhanced matrix product operators (LEMPOs) that can act on both the physical and virtual spaces of the matrix product states. This construction allows us to study Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories on infinite lattices. As examples, we show how to implement this method to study the massless and massive one-flavor Schwinger model and adjoint QCD$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to a few parameters, which are known only at leading order in perturbative expansions. The major challenges come from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and that it is closely related to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of conserved current 3-point correlators using exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep only the first few terms in the subgraph expansions to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative results with the bootstrap data and discuss their application to conductivity near the quantum critical point.</description>

Abstract: Few vacua are known for the three tachyon-free non-supersymmetric string theories. We find new classes of AdS backgrounds by focusing on spaces where the equations of motion reduce to purely algebraic conditions. Our first examples involve non-zero three-form fluxes supported either on direct product internal spaces or on $T_{p,q}$ geometries. For the ${\mathrm{SO}}(16)\times{\mathrm{SO}}(16)$ heterotic string, we then develop a method to engineer vacua with the addition of gauge fields. A formal Kaluza--Klein reduction yields complete solutions on a broad class of coset spaces $G/H$, automatically satisfying the three-form Bianchi identities with $H$-valued gauge fields.</description>

Abstract: We argue that interacting conformal line defects in free quantum field theories can exist, provided that inversion symmetry is broken. Important for our demonstration is the existence of a special cross ratio for bulk-defect-defect three point functions that is invariant under the conformal group but picks up a sign under inversion. We examine the particular case of a free scalar field in detail, and provide a toy model example where this bulk field interacts via a Yukawa term with fermions on the line. We expect nontrivial line defects may also exist for free Maxwell theory in four dimensions and free bulk fermions.</description>

Abstract: In conformal field theory, the presence of a defect may break the global symmetry, giving rise to defect operators such as the tilts. In this work, we derive integral identities that relate correlation functions involving bulk and defect operators -- including tilts -- to lower-point bulk-defect correlators, based on a detailed analysis of the Lie algebra of the symmetry group before and after the defect-induced symmetry breaking. As explicit examples, we illustrate these identities for the 1/2 BPS Maldacena-Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and for magnetic lines in the $O(N)$ model in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. We demonstrate that these identities provide a powerful tool both to check existing perturbative correlators and to impose nontrivial constraints on the CFT data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The imaginary part of the effective action encodes vacuum instability and particle production in the background field. Two standard approaches are commonly used to derive it: the Bogoliubov method and the Green's function method, which are usually expected to agree. However, in de Sitter spacetime they yield different results. We revisit this problem by introducing explicit time and momentum cutoffs in the Green's function representation of the effective action. The apparent discrepancy is found to be due to the different limiting procedures in regularization, which reproduces the Bogoliubov result and the Green's function result respectively. Therefore, the two approaches are understood to be different regularization limits of the same expression, which clarifies the origin of their disagreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider single particle excitations of the massive Chern-Simons field of mass $M$ in $AdS_3$ and evaluate their contribution at the first sub-leading order in $G_N$ to the entanglement entropy across the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. Quantizing the Chern- Simons field in $AdS_3$, we evaluate the corrections to the holographic entanglement entropy using the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula. The massive Chern-Simons field also obeys the equations of motion of a massive vector in $AdS_3$. The lowest energy single particle excitation of this field is dual to the primary operator of conformal dimensions $M + 1$ with spin one in the dual CFT, all other single particle excitations are dual to its global descendants. We compare the result for the entanglement entropy from the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula to the single interval entanglement entropy in large charge holographic CFT obtained using the replica trick for the primary and its tower of holomorphic descendants. The two results agree precisely in the leading and sub-leading terms of the short interval expansion. On taking the massless limit the result coincides with the contribution of a $U(1)$ current to the single interval entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>A new web of dualities from Majorana Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore new infrared dualities in $(2+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories involving Majorana fermions. Building on the recently proposed operator-deformation approach to bosonization dualities, we incorporate the bosonization of neutral fermions into the established web of Dirac dualities. Starting from the decomposition of a Dirac fermion into two Majorana components, we derive a hierarchy of dual bosonic descriptions based on orthogonal Chern-Simons-matter theories. This construction leads to novel boson-boson dualities, including an explicit correspondence between an $SO(N)$ theory with two real scalars and a $U(1)$ theory with one complex scalar, and their generalizations to arbitrary numbers of Majorana flavours. We analyze boundary conditions preserving chirality and demonstrate their role in matching gravitational anomalies and chiral central charges. Additional deformations yield orthogonal analogues of Ising-Gross-Neveu and pairing transitions. The resulting framework provides a unified Majorana-based extension of the three-dimensional duality web and clarifies the infrared structure of non-Abelian bosonization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matter operator in the double-scaled SYK model exhibits special properties when its dimension is analytically continued to -1/2. At this dimension, the operator is in a degenerate representation of the q-deformed oscillator algebra and satisfies a null vector equation. Its peculiar fusion property gives rise to recursion relations among matter correlation functions. We find that these relations allow us to determine the two-point function without having to sum over infinitely many chord diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional massless celestial amplitudes are distributional and fail to realize the celestial OPE -- most sharply in the non-MHV paradox, where OPEs predict nonzero celestial amplitudes with helicities $-{+}{+}+$ that are known to vanish at tree level. To resolve this, we introduce regular celestial amplitudes. We demonstrate that at tree-level, these amplitudes are non-distributional and, crucially, consistent with the celestial OPE. This suggests a revised dictionary: CCFT correlators are the regular, not conventional, celestial amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scalar Field Theory Based on the Extended Least Action Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently it is shown that the non-relativistic quantum formulations can be derived from a least observability principle [36]. In this paper, we apply the principle to massive scalar fields, and derive the Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the wave functional for the scalar fields. The principle extends the least action principle in classical field theory by factoring in two assumptions. First, the Planck constant defines the minimal amount of action a field needs to exhibit in order to be observable. Second, there are constant random field fluctuations. A novel method is introduced to define the information metrics to measure additional observable information due to the field fluctuations, \added{which is then converted to the additional action through the first assumption.} Applying the variation principle to minimize the total actions allows us to elegantly derive the transition probability of field fluctuations, the uncertainty relation, and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the wave functional. Furthermore, by defining the information metrics for field fluctuations using general definitions of relative entropy, we obtain a generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the wave functional that depends on the order of relative entropy. Our results demonstrate that the extended least action principle can be applied to derive both non-relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum scalar field theory. We expect it can be further used to obtain quantum theory for non-scalar fields.</description>

Abstract: We give a computability result for open Gromov-Witten invariants based on open WDVV equations. This is analogous to the result of Kontsevich-Manin for closed Gromov-Witten invariants. For greater generality, we base the argument on a formal object, the Frobenius superpotential, that generalizes several different definitions of open Gromov-Witten invariants. As an application, we prove vanishing properties for open Gromov-Witten invariants on products of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has long been desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, solved by higher category theory. The problem is solved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization--through the lens of higher category theory--of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, making the language of categories natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ pion vacua non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory; the structures behind the non-linear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory are related via an implicit Yang-Baxter equation.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Dissipative spectral form factor for elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF)--a widely used probe of non-Hermitian quantum chaos--in the elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble (eGinUE), which interpolates between the non-Hermitian Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) and the Hermitian Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) via a symmetry breaking parameter. We derive exact finite-dimensional results and large-dimensional approximations for the DSFF, revealing a scaling relationship that connects the DSFF of eGinUE to that of GinUE and the spectral form factor of GUE. This relation explains the distinct time scales underlying the characteristic \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure across GinUE, GUE, and crossover regimes. Additionally, we refine estimates of dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transition times for different symmetry regimes. We validate our results with Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate applications to paradigmatic quantum-chaotic systems: the crossover Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the crossover Power-law Banded random matrices. We highlight an analogy between eGinUE eigenvalues and the positions of a rotating fermionic gas in a two-dimensional anisotropic trap.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and echoes of a double braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational quasinormal modes and the gravitational echoes of a double braneworld. The double braneworld is a kind of split thick brane, which is crucial for addressing the hierarchy problem in the thick brane scenarios. Using the Bernstein spectral method, direct integration method, and asymptotic iteration method, we calculate the quasinormal mode frequencies of the double brane. We find that the quasinormal spectrum is very different from that of the single brane model, especially the high overtone mode. We also perform numerical evolution to study the time-domain properties of the characteristic modes of the double brane. The results show that when the degree of brane splitting is large, gravitational echoes of oscillation attenuation between sub-branes will appear in the thick brane. Furthermore, different long-lived Kaluza-Klein modes interfere with each other, resulting in a beating effect. Compared to a single brane model, the phenomenon of the split double brane is richer, and the lifetime of the massive Kaluza-Klein graviton of the double brane is longer. These phenomena may have potential phenomenological interest. We hope to detect these extra-dimensional signals in future gravitational wave detectors or accelerators.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes may have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity if the running of the gravitational constant coupling happens at low energies. Particularly, they should be more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter hypothesis by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. We selected the smallest values measured when the disk was in high/soft state, made them homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth, and compared with the expectations of the Kerr metric. We do not find any significant deviation. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases. We set the tightest constraint on the parameter $\xi$ obtained to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel family of entanglement measures for time-separated subsystems. Our definitions are applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. To illustrate their utility, we derive upper and lower bounds on time-separated correlation functions, akin to the bound on spatially separated correlators in terms of the mutual information. In certain cases our bounds are tight. For relativistic quantum field theories our definition agrees with the analytic continuation from spacelike to timelike separated regions. We provide relevant measurement protocols and execute them on the IBM quantum device ibm_sherbrooke for a simple qubit system. Also we perform explicit computations for an Ising spin chain, free fermions, (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories and holographic theories. Finally we explain how the proposed entanglement in time provides a microscopic definition for the recently introduced timelike pseudoentropy.</description>

      <title>Spinor Representations for Fields with any Spin: Lorentz Tensor Basis for Operators and Covariant Multipole Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a framework to parametrize and decompose operator matrix elements for particles with higher spin $(j &gt; 1/2)$ using chiral representations of the Lorentz group, i.e. the $(j,0)$ and $(0,j)$ representations and their parity-invariant direct sum. Unlike traditional approaches that require imposing constraints to eliminate spurious degrees of freedom, these chiral representations contain exactly the $2j+1$ components needed to describe a spin-$j$ particle. The central objects in the construction are the $t$-tensors, which are generalizations of the Pauli four-vector $\sigma^\mu$ for higher spin. For the generalized spinors of these representations, we demonstrate how the algebra of the $t$-tensors allows to formulate a generalization of the Dirac matrix basis for any spin. For on-shell bilinears, we show that a set consisting exclusively of covariant multipoles of order $0\leq m \leq 2j$ forms a complete basis. We provide explicit expressions for all bilinears of the generalized Dirac matrix basis, which are valid for any spin value. As a byproduct of our derivations we present an efficient algorithm to compute the $t$-tensor matrix elements. The formalism presented here paves the way to use a more unified approach to analyze the non-perturbative QCD structure of hadrons and nuclei across different spin values, with clear physical interpretation of the resulting distributions as covariant multipoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Goeritz matrices for computation of bipartite HOMFLY-PT polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Goeritz matrix is an alternative to the Kauffman bracket and, in addition, makes it possible to calculate the Jones polynomial faster with some minimal choice of a checkerboard surface of a link diagram. We introduce a modification of the Goeritz method that generalizes the Goeritz matrix for computing the HOMFLY-PT polynomials for any $N$ in the special case of bipartite links. Our method reduces to purely algebraic operations on matrices, and therefore, it can be easily implemented as a computer program. Bipartite links form a rather large family including a special class of Montesinos links constructed from the so-called rational tangles. We demonstrate how to obtain a bipartite diagram of such links and calculate the corresponding HOMFLY-PT polynomials using our developed generalized Goeritz method.</description>

      <title>Heat Capacity and the Violation of Scaling Laws in Gravitational System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the scaling laws in gravitational system from the perspective of free energy landscape and the scaling hypothesis. It has been found that for some special black holes, their critical exponents $(0,1,2,3)$ are beyond the mean field theory, and more surprisingly violate the scaling laws. We find that the main reason for the violation of the scaling laws is that the heat capacity at constant volume $C_V$ is 0, so the critical exponent $\alpha$ is often treated as 0, which can not be derived from the scaling hypothesis. We also find that there is a symmetry violation for the two coexistence states $\omega_l$ and $\omega_s$.</description>

      <title>Implications of a dark grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given that dark matter and normal matter are nontrivially unified in a grand unified theory, called dark grand unification, we derive novel residual theories at low energy explaining dark matter and neutrino mass. The first chain of which is $E_6\to SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L\otimes SU(3)_R$, which contains a matter parity by itself stabilizing a dark matter candidate and producing neutrino mass via a seesaw. The second chain is $\mathrm{Trinification}\to SU(3)_C \otimes SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_N$, which results in a novel family-universal 3-3-1-1 model, opposite to the normal 3-3-1-1 (or corresponding 3-3-1) model. Surprisingly, it is a variant of both minimal 3-3-1 model and 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos since both $e_R$ and $\nu_R$ are located at the bottoms of lepton triplets. Since this universal 3-3-1-1 model is properly embedded in the trinification, the above matter parity works governing dark matter stability as well as suppressing unwanted fermion mixings. Further, neutrino masses are naturally generated by a canonical seesaw combined with a scotogenic scheme.</description>

      <title>Searching for a Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrino in KATRIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility that the Right-handed neutrino is a five-dimensional state propagating along a micron size extra dimension, as required in the dark dimension proposal. We work out the signatures of R-neutrino production in KATRIN experiment and compare them with those of a sterile neutrino which manifests by a kink in the electron energy spectrum of the beta-decay at a value corresponding to the sterile neutrino mass. We explore the allowed parameter space of the compactification scale and the R-neutrino bulk mass versus the Yukawa coupling, and show that a large part of it is within KATRIN's sensitivity. When the bulk mass is much smaller than the compactification scale, several kinks could be observed corresponding to the positions of the R-neutrino Kaluza-Klein excitations, while for large bulk mass there will be effectively one kink at the position of the bulk mass.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of readout devices and semiclassical gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the common claim that nonlinear modifications of quantum theory necessarily violate the second law of thermodynamics. We focus on hypothetical extensions of quantum theory that contain readout devices. These black boxes provide a classical description of quantum states without perturbing them. They allow quantum state cloning, though in a way consistent with the relativistic no-signalling principle. We review the existence of such devices in the context of Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity, which postulates that the gravitational field remains classical and is sourced by the expectation value of a quantum energy-momentum tensor. We show that the definition of information in the models examined in this paper deviates from that given by von Neumann entropy, and that claims of second law violations based on the distinguishability of non-orthogonal states or on violations of uncertainty principles fail to hold in such theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As in the gravitational context, one of the most challenging open question in analogue black holes formed in Bose-Einstein condensates concerns the backreaction of Hawking-like radiation on the condensate and its subsequent evolution. In this work we derive the basic equations describing this backreaction within the density-phase formalism, which avoids infrared divergences and is particularly well suited to one-dimensional configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Growth and collapse of subsystem complexity under random unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For chaotic quantum dynamics modeled by random unitary circuits, we study the complexity of reduced density matrices of subsystems as a function of evolution time where the initial global state is a product pure state. The state complexity is defined as the minimum number of local quantum channels to generate a given state from a product state to a good approximation. In $1+1$d, we prove that the complexity of subsystems of length $\ell$ smaller than half grows linearly in time $T$ at least up to $T = \ell / 4$ but becomes zero after time $T = \ell /2$ in the limit of a large local dimension, while the complexity of the complementary subsystem of length larger than half grows linearly in time up to exponentially late times. Using holographic correspondence, we give some evidence that the state complexity of the smaller subsystem should actually grow linearly up to time $T = \ell/2$ and then abruptly decay to zero.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin polarization from $\rho$ meson condensation in rotating hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of vector mesons in extreme environments provides a unique probe of non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We investigate the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of spin-1 $\rho$ mesons in dense rotating hadronic matter, a regime relevant to the peripheral heavy-ion collisions and the interiors of rapidly rotating neutron stars. When the $\rho$ meson chemical potential ($\mu_\rho$) approaches its effective mass ($m_\rho^*$), a phase transition to BEC occurs. We demonstrate that this transition is non-trivially influenced by global rotation, which couples to the spin of the $\rho$ mesons, leading to a macroscopic spin alignment of the condensate along the axis of rotation. This interplay between condensation and rotation results in distinct polarization patterns, which can serve as a possible signature of a BEC in experiments. The results suggest that rapidly rotating neutron stars may harbor an anisotropic, spin-polarized $\rho$-condensed phase, which could impact their equation of state.</description>

Abstract: In the present article, we assume that the first approximation of the scattering operator is given and that it has the logarithmic divergence. This first approximation allows us to construct the so called deviation factor. Using the deviation factor, we regularize all terms of the scattering operator's approximations. The infrared and ultraviolet cases as well as concrete examples are considered. Thus, for a wide range of cases, we provide a positive answer to the well-known problem of J. R. Oppenheimer regarding scattering operators in QED: ``Can the procedure be freed of the expansion in $\varepsilon$ and carried out rigorously?"</description>

      <title>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions surpassing the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for achieving the logical gates in the $(n+1)$-th level of Clifford hierarchy in $n$ spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tidal Response of Non-rotating Black Holes: Connecting the MST Formalism and Worldline EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of a black hole (BH) to tidal forces encodes key information about the underlying gravitational theory and affects the waveform of gravitational waves emitted during binary inspiral processes. In this paper, we analyze the dynamical tidal response of static and spherically symmetric BHs in a low-frequency regime within general relativity (GR), based on a matching between the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) methods for an analytical approach to BH perturbations and the worldline effective field theory (EFT) for an efficient and unified computation of the binary dynamics within the post-Newtonian regime. We show that the renormalized tidal response function is subject to inevitable ambiguities associated with the choice of renormalization scheme and with the initial condition of the renormalization flow equation. Once these ambiguities are fixed, we obtain scheme-dependent dynamical tidal Love numbers. We also discuss possible extensions of our formalism, including generic non-rotating compact objects (e.g., neutron stars) in GR and BHs in theories beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</description>

      <title>Some perspective of thermodynamical and optical properties of black holes in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by integrating the dilaton field (as a UV correction) with dRGT-like massive gravity (as an IR correction) into Einstein gravity, we investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of black holes within this gravitational framework. We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $\beta$, $\alpha$, and the massive parameters ($\eta_{1}$ and $\eta_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dilaton coupling constant ($\alpha$), charge ($q$), the massive gravity parameter ($\eta_1$), and the graviton mass ($m_g$) on the radius of the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadow. Moreover, the theoretical shadow radius is compared to the observational data from $Sgr A^*$. Additionally, we investigate the energy emission rate of these black holes, revealing that these parameters substantially influence the emission peak.</description>

Abstract: We propose HoloNet, a neural-network framework that unifies lattice QCD(LQCD) thermodynamics and holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory within a data-to-holography pipeline. Instead of assuming specific functional forms, HoloNet learns the metric profile $A(z)$ and the gauge-dilaton coupling $f(z)$ directly from 2+1-flavor LQCD data at $\mu=0$. These learned functions are embedded into the EMD equations, enabling the model to reproduce the lattice equation of state and baryon number fluctuations with high fidelity. Once trained, HoloNet provides a fully data-driven holographic description of QCD that extends naturally to finite density, allowing us to map the phase diagram and estimate the location of the critical end point (CEP). The reconstructed potential $V(\phi)$ and coupling $f(\phi)$ agree quantitatively with those obtained from holographic renormalization, demonstrating that HoloNet can consistently bridge different holographic models.</description>
