      <title>Hyperparameters are all you need: Using five-step inference for an original diffusion model to generate images comparable to the latest distillation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8 steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO 2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and 17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further, it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61, respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps, whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation algorithm.

      <title>Visualizing Spatial Point Clouds: A Task-Oriented Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques, our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective, interpretable, and user-centered visualization techniques.</description>

      <title>GS-Share: Enabling High-fidelity Map Sharing with Incremental Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications, including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction. However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous updates, and network efficiency remains elusive. To address these challenges, we introduce GS-Share, a photorealistic map-sharing system with a compact representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update. We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively. Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission overhead by 36%.</description>

      <title>PCG-Informed Neural Solvers for High-Resolution Homogenization of Periodic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17087v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of periodic microstructures are pivotal in various engineering applications. Homogenization theory is a powerful tool for predicting these properties by averaging the behavior of complex microstructures over a representative volume element. However, traditional numerical solvers for homogenization problems can be computationally expensive, especially for high-resolution and complicated topology and geometry. Existing learning-based methods, while promising, often struggle with accuracy and generalization in such scenarios. To address these challenges, we present CGINS, a preconditioned-conjugate-gradient-solver-informed neural network for solving homogenization problems. CGINS leverages sparse and periodic 3D convolution to enable high-resolution learning while ensuring structural periodicity. It features a multi-level network architecture that facilitates effective learning across different scales and employs minimum potential energy as label-free loss functions for self-supervised learning. The integrated preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations ensure that the network provides PCG-friendly initial solutions for fast convergence and high accuracy. Additionally, CGINS imposes a global displacement constraint to ensure physical consistency, addressing a key limitation in prior methods that rely on Dirichlet anchors. Evaluated on large-scale datasets with diverse topologies and material configurations, CGINS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (relative error below 1%) and outperforms both learning-based baselines and GPU-accelerated numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers 2 times to 10 times speedups over traditional methods while maintaining physically reliable predictions at resolutions up to $512^3$.</description>

      <title>FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However, most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.</description>

      <title>ROGR: Relightable 3D Objects using Generative Relighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation. We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our approach on real-world object captures.</description>

      <title>Topological Autoencoders++: Fast and Accurate Cycle-Aware Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel topology-aware dimensionality reduction approach aiming at accurately visualizing the cyclic patterns present in high dimensional data. To that end, we build on the Topological Autoencoders (TopoAE) formulation. First, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of its associated loss and show that a zero loss indeed induces identical persistence pairs (in high and low dimensions) for the $0$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^0$) of the Rips filtration. We also provide a counter example showing that this property no longer holds for a naive extension of TopoAE to PH$^d$ for $d\ge 1$. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel generalization of TopoAE to $1$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^1$), called TopoAE++, for the accurate generation of cycle-aware planar embeddings, addressing the above failure case. This generalization is based on the notion of cascade distortion, a new penalty term favoring an isometric embedding of the $2$-chains filling persistent $1$-cycles, hence resulting in more faithful geometrical reconstructions of the $1$-cycles in the plane. We further introduce a novel, fast algorithm for the exact computation of PH for Rips filtrations in the plane, yielding improved runtimes over previously documented topology-aware methods. Our method also achieves a better balance between the topological accuracy, as measured by the Wasserstein distance, and the visual preservation of the cycles in low dimensions. Our C++ implementation is available at https://github.com/MClemot/TopologicalAutoencodersPlusPlus.</description>
