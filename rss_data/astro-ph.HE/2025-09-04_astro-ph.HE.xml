      <title>Explosive Dispersal Outflows as a New Class of Fermi Gamma-Ray Sources: The Case of DR21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from an explosive dispersal outflow in the Milky Way, revealing a new source class of high-energy emission. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.2 $-$ 500 GeV range, we detect a significant ($ &gt; 35\sigma $) $\gamma$-ray emission spatially coincident with the DR21 outflow, located at a distance of 1.5 kpc in the Cygnus-X star-forming region. The spectrum follows a power-law plus an exponential cutoff model with a spectral index $\Gamma = 2.08\pm0.02$ and $E_{\rm c} = 10089 \pm 2963$~MeV, integrating which we estimate a total $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma} \simeq (2.17\pm 0.15) \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.1-500$ GeV band. This $\gamma$-ray emission is spatially coincident with additional multiwavelength data, including allWISE mid-IR and regions of dense gas. By comparing the observed $\gamma$-ray luminosity to the estimated kinetic energy of the outflow inferred from prior studies of DR21, we find that $\leq 15\%$ of the kinetic power of the outflow goes into particle acceleration. Our findings demonstrate that explosive dispersal outflows can contribute significantly to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background of the Galaxy, highlighting their importance as particle accelerators in star-forming environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution of Quasi-Hierarchical Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational dynamics of quasi-hierarchical triple systems, where the outer orbital period is significantly longer than the inner one, but the outer orbit is extremely eccentric, rendering the time at pericentre comparable to the inner period. Such systems are not amenable to the standard techniques of perturbation theory and orbit-averaging. Modelling the evolution of these triples as a sequence of impulses at the outer pericentre, we show that such triples lend themselves to a description as a correlated random walk of the inner binary's eccentricity and angular-momentum vector, going beyond the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism. The outer orbit is seen to excite the inner eccentricity arbitrarily close to unity, eventually. These quasi-hierarchical triples constitute, therefore, a natural mechanism for creating highly eccentric binaries. We discuss applications for gravitational-wave mergers engendered by this process, and show that for a large portion of the parameter space, the time-to-coalescence is significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>The 2020 Superburst of 4U 1608-522 and its impact on the accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superbursts are rare events observed from bursting neutron star low mass X-ray binaries. They are thought to originate from unstable burning of the thick layer of Carbon on the surface of the neutron star, causing the observed X-ray flashes to last several hours. Given their fluence it has long been thought that superbursts may have significant effects on the accretion flow around the neutron star. In this paper, we first present evidence for a new superburst observed from 4U 1608-522 by MAXI during the 2020 outburst, around 00:45 UTC on 16 July 2020. We compare some of the properties of this superburst and the underlying outburst with the events recorded on May 5 2005 by RXTE and most recently in 2025 by MAXI. We then present our spectral analysis of NICER and Insight-HXMT data obtained before and after the 2020 superburst event. Our results indicate that the inner disk temperature and the radius show a systematic evolution in the following few days, which may be related to the superburst. We show that the timescale of the observed evolution can not be governed by viscous timescales unless the viscosity parameter is unrealistically low.</description>

      <title>GRB 250704B: An Off-axis Short GRB with a Long-Lived Afterglow Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed multi-wavelength afterglow study of the short GRB 250704B, extensively monitored in optical and near-infrared bands. Its afterglow displays an unusually long-duration plateau followed by an achromatic break and a steep decline, deviating from canonical GRB afterglows. While long plateaus are often explained by central engine activity, we find that for GRB 250704B, an energy injection model requires unreasonable parameters. The afterglow is better explained by an off-axis power-law structured jet with a narrow core ($\theta_c \approx 0.7^{\circ}$) viewed at a modest angle ($\theta_v \approx 1.9^{\circ}$). A comparison with GRB 170817A shows that both events are consistent with the off-axis structured jet scenario, where the shape of the light curve is governed primarily by the geometry of the jet and the viewing angle rather than the energetics, microphysical parameters, or external density. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating the jet structure in GRB modeling.</description>

      <title>Counterpart identification and classification for eRASS1 and characterisation of the AGN content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [abridged] Accurately accounting for the AGN phase in galaxy evolution requires a large, clean AGN sample. This is now possible with SRG/eROSITA. The public Data Release 1 (DR1, Jan 31, 2024) includes 930,203 sources from the Western Galactic Hemisphere. The data enable the selection of a large AGN sample and the discovery of rare sources. However, scientific return depends on accurate characterisation of the X-ray emitters, requiring high-quality multiwavelength data. This paper presents the identification and classification of optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3, CatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and trained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a Machine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a reference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were computed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1 sources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are extragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE, Gaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less reliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features available to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic Plane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of associations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately 18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three high-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as a benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in particular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness and purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universe most energetic engines.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dissipative Magnetohydrodynamics for accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) theory for a dilute electron-ion gas governed by the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation, using the method of moments. This yields an extended MHD framework beyond standard astrophysical formulations, which typically include only the shear-stress component parllel to the magnetic field. We analyze our framework in the linear regime and show that it leads to the firehose instability when the bakground longitudinal pressure becomes large. In these extreme scenario, the transverse and semi-transverse shear-stress components become large and may play a role in accretion disk dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extending the short gamma-ray burst population from sub-threshold triggers in Fermi/GBM and GECAM data and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) is critically important for the research of compact object mergers and multi-messenger astrophysics, but a significant part of SGRBs fall below the trigger threshold of GRB detectors, and thus are often missed. Here we present a systematic search for and verification of missed SGRBs using Fermi/GBM subthreshold triggers, jointly analyzing data from GBM, GECAM-B, and GECAM-C. Among 466 Fermi/GBM sub-threshold events (with reliability &gt;= 5) from 2021 to 2024, 181 are within GECAM's field of view. We find that 49 out of 181 are confirmed astrophysical transients, and 41 can be classified as SGRBs. Thus, the SGRB detection rate of Fermi/GBM is increased to about 50 per year. Additionally, a complete multi-instrument monitoring and systematic verification of GBM sub-threshold events is expected to further increase the SGRB rate to about 80 per year, which is about 100% improvement relative to the GBM-triggered SGRBs. These results may have important implications on the local formation rate of SGRBs and the binary neutron star merger rate. We also searched for potential temporal coincidences between these SGRBs and gravitational waves from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 run resulting in no detection.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency observations of low-mass binary systems with neutron star candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, astrometric and spectroscopic observations resulted in the discovery of several low-mass binaries with invisible components, which are expected to be compact objects. In about two dozen cases, the masses of these components are consistent with neutron stars. We use low-frequency archival data obtained with the Large Phased Array in Pushchino to search for radio emission from five of these systems. For all the systems, we do not detect persistent or periodic emission. In one case (2MASS J1527+3536), we identify a single radio burst with a flux of 13 Jy and a duration of 0.13 s. However, the dispersion measure of the burst does not correspond to an expected value for the source. We discuss several possibilities to explain the properties of this burst.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent detections of kilonova-like emission following long-duration gamma-ray bursts GRB211211A and GRB230307A have been interpreted as originating from the merger of two neutron stars. In this work, we demonstrate that these observations are also consistent with nucleosynthesis originating from a collapsar scenario. Our model accurately predicts the observed optical and infrared light curves using a single weak $r$-process component. The absence of lanthanide-rich material in our model, consistent with the data, challenges the prevailing interpretation that a red evolution in such transients necessarily indicates the presence of heavy $r$-process elements.</description>

      <title>Neutron star envelopes with machine learning: a single-hidden-layer neural network application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal and magneto-thermal simulations are an important tool for advancing understanding of neutron stars, as they allow us to compare models of their internal structure and physical processes against observations constraining macroscopic properties such as the surface temperature. A major challenge in the simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope, exhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a geometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate envelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between the temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface temperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for approximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies from the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard prescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be used as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast evaluation necessary in neutron star simulations. We explored the optimal network architecture and hyperparameter choices and used a special holdout set designed to avoid overfitting to the structure of the input data. We find that relatively simple neural networks are sufficient for the approximation of the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation with an accuracy $\sim 3\%$. The presented workflow can be used in a wide range of problems where simulations are used to construct approximating formulae.</description>

      <title>Diffusive shock acceleration: non-classical model of cosmic ray transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the theory of diffusive shock acceleration is extended to the case of non-classical particle transport with L\'{e}vy flights and L\'{e}vy traps, when the mean square displacement grows nonlinearly with time. In this approach the Green function is not a Gaussian but it exhibits power-law tails. By using the propagator appropriate for non-classical diffusion, it is found for the first time that energy spectral index of particles accelerated at shock front is $\gamma = [\alpha (\mathrm{r} + 5) - 6 \beta]/[\alpha(\mathrm{r}-1)]$, where $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$ and $0 &lt;\beta &lt; 1$ are the exponents of power-law behavior of L\'{e}vy flights and L\'{e}vy traps, respectively.
  We note that this result coincides with standard slope at $\alpha=2, \beta=1$ (normal diffusion), and also includes those obtained earlier for the subdiffusion ($\alpha=2, \beta&lt;1$) and superdiffusion ($\alpha&lt;2, \beta=1$) regimes.</description>

      <title>X-ray reverberation modelling of the observed UV/optical power spectra of quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a significant amount of effort has been put into investigating the ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination of AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability. Our main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the assumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain the observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc transfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical model and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model allows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the scenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an external source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars determined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light curves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of quasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\sim 1300$\AA\ up to $4000$\AA. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while the X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in agreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray reverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as recent time-lag measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission is produced by the interaction of high-energy cosmic rays propagating through the Milky Way with interstellar gas and radiation fields. Its measurement can provide crucial insights into the acceleration and transport of cosmic rays throughout our Galaxy. Here, we present a new analysis of the TeV Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission using 8 years of HAWC data. This data was processed with the updated Pass 5 processing, enhancing the sensitivity and resolution of the instrument. For the analysis, we make use of Gammapy, an open-source package for gamma-ray astronomy, and recent models of the Galactic diffuse emission at TeV energies. After subtracting the emission from sources using an algorithm akin to that developed for the foreseen CTAO Galactic plane survey, we find significant remaining emission throughout the Galactic plane. We show the latitudinal and longitudinal flux profiles of the emission in multiple parts of the galaxy taking into account various sources of uncertainty and compare to existing models. We find significant emission beyond 3 degree latitude, consistent in shape with the prediction for the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar gas. We also demonstrate that our results are consistent with recent LHAASO results when equivalent analysis methods are used.</description>

      <title>Amplified capture rate of dark matter in compact binaries and constraints on bosonic dark matter from GW170817</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion of dark matter (DM) onto compact objects and the potential gravitational collapse of neutron stars due to this accretion has become a promising indirect probe of DM properties, complementing terrestrial experiments. We show that the accretion flux of DM on stellar objects is amplified in binary systems due to the complex gravitational interaction of said particles with the binary. We perform few-body Monte Carlo simulations to show that this amplification factor is $\sim4-5$ for circular binaries, small DM velocity dispersions and mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.3$. We use this factor to improve previous constraints on the scattering cross section of non-annihilating bosonic DM with baryonic matter, and derive upper bounds on this cross section from the observation of the binary NS merger associated with GW170817. We also show that the maximally accretable mass fraction of DM by binary NSs is $\lesssim10^{-3}$, even for extreme DM densities only possible in DM spikes, due to the dynamical friction exerted by the ambient DM.</description>

      <title>Machine learning reconstruction of cosmic ray parameters in EAS at HAWC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory comprises 300 water Cherenkov detectors, each equipped with four photomultipliers, located on the Volc\'{a}n Sierra Negra in Mexico at 4,100 masl. This observatory can detect gamma rays in an energy range from 300 GeV to 100 TeV and cosmic rays from 100 GeV to 1 PeV. One of HAWC's primary challenges is characterizing air showers and estimate their physical parameters, a highly complex task due to the nature of the data and the processes involved. Currently, HAWC employs two energy estimators for gamma rays: the ground parameter method and a neural network-based approach. However, for cosmic rays, only the likelihood-based estimator is available. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to achieve more accurate estimation of the physical parameters of cosmic rays. These techniques are explored as an alternative for reconstructing the physical properties of extensive air showers using simulated data aligned with the observatory's configuration. Various models were trained and evaluated through an optimized pipeline and the most effective one was selected as the final implementation after a comprehensive comparison. This approach improves the accuracy of physical parameter estimation, contributing significantly to the detailed characterization of cosmic ray events.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Galactic Cosmic Ray Modulation in the Heliosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota &amp; Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.</description>

      <title>LHS in LHS: A new expansion strategy for Latin hypercube sampling in simulation design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is a prominent tool in simulation design, with a variety of applications in high-dimensional and computationally expensive problems. LHS allows for various optimization strategies, most notably to ensure space-filling properties. However, LHS is a single-stage algorithm that requires a priori knowledge of the targeted sample size. In this work, we present LHS in LHS, a new expansion algorithm for LHS that enables the addition of new samples to an existing LHS-distributed set while (approximately) preserving its properties. In summary, the algorithm identifies regions of the parameter space that are far from the initial set, draws a new LHS within those regions, and then merges it with the original samples. As a by-product, we introduce a new metric, the LHS degree, which quantifies the deviation of a given design from an LHS distribution. Our public implementation is distributed via the Python package expandLHS.</description>

      <title>Probing Formation Channels of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population study of stellar-mass black hole (sBH) binaries with ground-based gravitational wave detection has achieved tremendous success in recent years. Future observation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals will similarly require proper population analysis that identify the formation channels, measuring the branch ratio(s) and characterizing major properties within each major channel. In this work, we propose that the measurement of eccentricity, inclination, and component mass provides critical information to distinguish different formation channels and probe detailed formation mechanisms. Focusing on the dry and wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals, we establish the theoretical expectation of these observables in each formation channel. We also discuss how their distributions can be used to probe lifetime and turbulence level of active galactic nuclei disks, accretion patterns of supermassive black holes and population properties of sBHs within nuclear star clusters.</description>

      <title>Impact of Pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 Observations on $f(\mathcal{Q}, \mathbb{T})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is to investigate the viability and stability of a pulsar filled with anisotropic matter in $f(\mathcal{Q}, \mathbb{T})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{Q}$ represents non-metricity and $\mathbb{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In this context, we employ non-singular solution and a particular model of this gravity. We use junction conditions to evaluate unknown constants in the metric coefficients. Observations from the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 star are employed to validate the model, producing stable configurations that address both geometric and physical characteristics. This framework establishes relationships between various physical quantities, including fluid parameters, anisotropy, mass-radius relation, redshift, the Zeldovich condition, energy conditions, causality conditions, adiabatic index, Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, the equation of state parameter, and compactness. Our findings confirm the viability and stability of the proposed pulsar star in this theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Revised classification of the CHIME fast radio bursts with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short-duration and energetic radio transients of unknown origin. Observationally, they are commonly categorized into repeaters and non-repeaters. However, this binary classification may be influenced by observational limitations such as sensitivity and time coverage of telescopes. In this work, we employ unsupervised machine learning techniques to re-examine the CHIME/FRB catalog, with the goal of identifying intrinsic groupings in the FRB population without relying on preassigned labels. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) for clustering, we find that the FRB sample separates naturally into two major clusters. One cluster contains nearly all known repeaters but is contaminated by some apparently non-repeaters, while the other cluster is dominated by non-repeaters. This suggests that certain FRBs previously labeled as non-repeaters may share intrinsic similarities with repeaters. The mutual information analysis reveals that rest-frame frequency width and peak frequency are the most informative features governing the clustering structure. Even when reducing the input space to just these two features, the classification remains robust.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \, \rm M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \, \rm M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $&lt; 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 &lt; M_{\rm VMS} \, [\rm M_\odot] &lt; 5\times10^4$ within $&lt;1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet \sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Gas in Globular Clusters I: Gas Retention and Its Possible Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures imply early retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the accumulation, fate, and eventual removal of gas released by evolved stars in young GCs, and their implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that low-velocity (&lt; 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are gravitationally retained in &gt;10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions, mapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed second population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle accretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs and neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes will clear the gas by 10^9 yr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2 follow-up: Exploring the origin of the Type Ia supernova host galaxy step through Si II velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their host galaxy stellar masses is well documented. In particular, Hubble residuals display a luminosity shift based on host mass, known as the mass step, which is often used as an extra correction in the standardisation of SN Ia luminosities. Here we investigate Hubble residuals and the mass step in the context of Si II $\lambda 6355$ velocities, using 277 near-peak SNe Ia from ZTF DR2. We divide the sample into high-velocity (HV) and normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia, separated at 12,000 km/s, resulting in 70 HV and 207 NV objects. We then examine links between Si II $\lambda$6355 velocities, light-curve stretch $x_{1}$, colour $c$, and host properties to explore potential environmental and/or progenitor-related effects. Although we only find a marginal difference between the Hubble residuals of HV and NV SNe Ia, the NV mass step is $0.149 \pm 0.024$ mag ($6.3\sigma$), while HV SNe Ia show $0.046 \pm 0.041$ mag ($1.1\sigma$), consistent with zero. The NV-HV mass-step difference is $\sim 2.2\sigma$. The clearest subtype difference is seen in central regions ($d_{DLR} &lt; 1$), where NV SNe Ia show a strong mass step but HV SNe Ia none, yielding a $3.1-3.6\sigma$ difference. A host-colour step appears for both: NV $0.142 \pm 0.024$ mag ($5.9\sigma$) and HV $0.158 \pm 0.042$ mag ($3.8\sigma$). Overall, NV and HV colour steps are consistent. HV SNe Ia show modest ($\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$) steps in outer regions ($d_{DLR} &gt; 1$), while NV SNe show stronger environmental trends. Thus, NV SNe Ia appear more environmentally sensitive, especially in central, likely metal-rich and older regions, while HV SNe Ia show weaker, subset-dependent trends, and applying a universal mass-step correction could introduce biases. Refined classifications or environment-dependent factors may improve future cosmological analyses beyond standard $x_{1}$ and $c$ cuts.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Cosmic Ray Halos from Bursty Star Formation and Active Galactic Nuclei: Semi-Analytic Formalism and Galaxy Formation Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution has seen a theoretical resurgence in the past decade, but significant uncertainties remain in CR transport through the interstellar and circum-galactic media (ISM and CGM). While several works indicate CR effects may be notable in both star-forming and quenched massive galaxies, modeling the vast CR transport parameter space currently allowed by observations is computationally restrictive to survey. Analytic treatments of CR feedback have provided useful insights to potential ramifications in different regimes, but have relied on time-steady assumptions which may not well characterize CR effects at different cosmic epochs and galaxy mass scales. We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing the time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified assumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR transport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from bursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially alter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies ($\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a significant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies ($\gtrsim M_{\textrm{halo}} \sim 10^{13} M_\odot$), and we speculate that these time-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio Circles". Finally, we benchmark our semi-analytic formalism against a cosmic ray-magnetohydrodynamic (CR-MHD) cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation directly modeling the CR scattering rate and emergent transport in full generality, highlighting the validity of our approach. We conclude by motivating careful consideration of time-dependent ``softening" effects in sub-grid routines for CR feedback, particularly for use in large cosmological volumes.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low-energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newton's law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are utterly negligible when considering the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop-induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newton's law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa-type deviations and inverse-square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth-force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and future experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. Our results provide a model-independent framework for confronting dark-sector scenarios with precision gravity data, and highlight the complementarity of particle physics and short-distance gravitational tests in probing new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A Diagnostic Kit for Optical Emission Lines Shaped by Accretion Disc Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blueshifted absorption is the classic spectroscopic signature of an accretion disc wind in X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, outflows can also create pure emission lines, especially at optical wavelengths. Therefore, developing other outflow diagnostics for these types of lines is worthwhile. With this in mind, we construct a systematic grid of 3645 synthetic wind-formed H-alpha line profiles for CVs with the radiative transfer code SIROCCO. Our grid yields a variety of line shapes: symmetric, asymmetric, single- to quadruple-peaked, and even P-Cygni profiles. About 20% of these lines -- our `Gold' sample -- have strengths and widths consistent with observations. We use this grid to test a recently proposed method for identifying wind-formed emission lines based on deviations in the wing profile shape: the `excess equivalent width diagnostic diagram'. We find that our `Gold' sample can preferentially populate the suggested `wind regions' of this diagram. However, the method is highly sensitive to the adopted definition of the line profile `wing'. Hence, we propose a refined definition based on the full-width at half maximum to improve the interpretability of the diagnostic diagram. Furthermore, we define an approximate scaling relation for the strengths of wind-formed CV emission lines in terms of the outflow parameters. This relation provides a fast way to assess whether -- and what kind of -- outflow can produce an observed emission line. All our wind-based models are open-source and we provide an easy-to-use web-based tool to browse our full set of H-alpha spectral profiles.</description>

      <title>Low radio frequency detections of known pulsars and identification of new candidates with GLEAM-X: GP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-based searches have become a complementary approach for identifying pulsars, particularly at MHz frequencies where scattering and high dispersion measures affect high-time resolution observations. In this work, we searched the Galactic Plane (GP) data release from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky Murchison Widefield Array eXtended (GLEAM-X) survey, a widefield continuum radio survey covering the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range, at the positions of known pulsars in the ATNF catalogue (version 2.6.2) that lie within its sky coverage. We present the spectral energy distribution for 193 known pulsars located at |b| &lt; 11deg. Notably, 106 of these represent the first detections below 400 MHz. We also cross-match the GLEAM-X: GP compact source catalogue with unassociated sources in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalogue, filtering for gamma-ray spectral and variability properties, as well as coincidence with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We have identified 106 possible pulsar candidates. This work demonstrates the importance of sensitive, low-frequency Galactic plane surveys for detecting emission from known pulsars and presents a potential way of searching for new pulsar candidates that would otherwise be missed by traditional time-domain searches.</description>

      <title>Origin of nucleon mass in the light of PSR J0614-3329 with quark-hadron crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent NICER observation of PSR J0614-3329, revealing the smallest reliably measured neutron star radius of $R = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km at mass $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_\odot$, provides an unprecedented constraint on the equation of state of dense matter. We investigate the implications of this measurement for the origin of nucleon mass within the parity doublet model framework, which naturally incorporates both chiral variant and chiral invariant mass components. We construct unified equations of state by employing the parity doublet model with isovector scalar meson $a_0(980)$ for hadronic matter up to twice nuclear saturation density, smoothly connected to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type quark model at higher densities through a crossover transition. By systematically varying the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ and quark matter parameters, we determine which values simultaneously satisfy all current astrophysical constraints, including gravitational wave observations from GW170817, NICER measurements of several pulsars, and the existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars. The inclusion of PSR J0614-3329 dramatically refines the allowed range of the chiral invariant mass from the previous constraint of $580~\text{MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860~\text{MeV}$ to $800~\text{MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860~\text{MeV}$, raising the lower bound by approximately 220 MeV. This result indicates that the chiral invariant mass must constitute at least 85\% of the nucleon mass, challenging the traditional picture of nucleon mass generation through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking alone and highlighting the importance of gluon condensation and other non-chiral mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Atmospheres and Circumstellar Interaction in J1901+1458: Revisiting the Most Compact White Dwarf Merger Remnant in the light of new UV and X-ray data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double degenerate white dwarf (WD) mergers can exhibit extreme magnetic fields exceeding $10^{8}$ G and rapid rotation, but their spectral-energy distributions and high-energy emission mechanisms remain poorly characterised. ZTF J1901+1458 stands out as the most compact and strongly magnetised object discovered in this class to date. Recent Chandra observations have revealed that the white dwarf is also a source of soft X-ray emission, inconsistent with a photospheric origin. We analyse new phase resolved UV spectroscopy from the HST combined with optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, with newly developed magnetic atmosphere models to determine its effective temperature, radius, mass, average surface magnetic field strength, and cooling age. Our results demonstrate that the spectral break at $\approx$3000 {\AA}, observed in several highly magnetised WDs, is well-reproduced by our new models, which take into account the effect of magnetic opacities on the structure of the atmosphere. Our best-fit parameters for the WD yield an effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}=28,015\pm 20$ K) and larger radius ($2630\pm10$ km) than previously reported. Furthermore, the near-infrared data exclude the presence of a stellar or brown dwarf companion hotter than $\approx$700 K. We also jointly analyse the previously published Chandra data and new XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The faint X-ray emission, $L_X =(1.3\pm0.2)\times10^{27}$ erg/s is very soft and highly pulsed on the rotation period of the WD. We suggest that the X-rays are powered by accretion or via the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with CSM. If the rapidly rotating magnetic field could power a weak wind along open field lines, material could be extracted directly from the surface of the WD. Alternatively, accretion of fallback material from the merger or the tidal disruption of a planetary body are possible sources of CSM.</description>

      <title>PTA Frequency Band Individual Gravitational Wave Sources and Dark Energy Detection Based on Cosmological Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), detectable via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offer a novel avenue to constrain dark energy. Based on cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy formation models, this study explores the detectability of individual nanohertz SMBBH sources using next-generation PTAs and their potential for constraining dark energy under an optimistic scenario considering only the presence of white noise. By constructing light-cone SMBBH populations across hardening timescales ($\tau_H = 0.1/5/10$Gyr) and computing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), we find advanced PTAs can resolve $10^2$--$10^3$ sources with SNR $&gt; 8$ (primarily at $z &lt; 1$ with chirp masses of $10^8$--$10^{10}M_{\odot}$). If electromagnetic counterparts can be identified, optimal configurations ($\sigma_t = 50$ns, $N_p = 1000$, $T_{\text{obs}} = 30$yr with$ \tau_H \leq 5$Gyr) could constrain the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w$ to $\Delta w \sim 0.023$--$0.048$, where the constraints only exhibit weak dependence on $\tau_H$ within $0.1$--$5$Gyr. If only $10\%$ of GW sources have detectable electromagnetic counterparts, constraints weaken to $\Delta w = 0.075$ ($\tau_H = 0.1$Gyr) and $\Delta w = 0.162$ ($\tau_H = 5$Gyr) under the most optimal parameter configuration. What's more, conservative PTAs ($N_p = 500$, $\sigma_t = 100$--$200$ns) with additional $30$-year data accumulation could double resolvable source counts and improve $\Delta w$ precision by $\sim 40\%$.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Dark Matter in Red Giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red giants (RGs) provide a promising astrophysical environment for capturing dark matter (DM) via elastic scattering with stellar nuclei. Captured DM particles migrate toward the helium-rich core and accumulate into a compact configuration. As the DM population grows, it can become self-gravitating and undergo gravitational collapse, leading to adiabatic contraction through interactions with the ambient medium. The resulting energy release, through elastic scattering and, where relevant, DM annihilation during collapse, locally heats the stellar core and can trigger helium ignition earlier than that predicted by standard stellar evolution. We analyze the conditions under which DM-induced heating leads to runaway helium burning and identify the critical DM mass required for ignition. Imposing the observational constraint that helium ignition must not occur before the observed luminosity at the tip of the RG branch, we translate these conditions into bounds on DM properties. Remarkably, we find that RGs are sensitive to DM, particularly with masses around $10^{11} \,{\rm GeV}$ and spin-independent scattering cross sections near $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^2$, which is comparable to the reach of current terrestrial direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Elemental and Isotopic Yields from T Coronae Borealis: Predictions and Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova system expected to undergo its next outburst within the next two years. Recent hydrodynamic simulations have predicted the nucleosynthetic yields for both carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe) white-dwarf models, but without accounting for thermonuclear reaction-rate uncertainties. We perform detailed Monte Carlo post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations based on updated thermonuclear reaction rates and uncertainties from the 2025 evaluation. We quantify the resulting abundance uncertainties and identify the key nuclear reactions that dominate them. Our results show that both the CO and ONe nova models robustly produce characteristic CNO isotopes. More pronounced abundance differences emerge for elements with A $\ge$ 20. Sulfur is the most robust observational discriminator between the CO and ONe nova models, with a model-to-model difference of a factor of $\approx$30 and minimal sensitivity to reaction rate uncertainties. Neon, silicon, and phosphorus exhibit even larger abundance differences (factors of $\approx$150-250), providing strong diagnostic potential. While their predicted yields are subject to larger uncertainties, these remain smaller than the model-to-model differences, allowing these elements to serve as useful, though less precise, tracers of white-dwarf composition. Chlorine, argon, and potassium also differ between models, but the 1$\sigma$-abundance ranges for the CO and ONe models overlap, reducing their present usefulness as composition tracers. We find that only nine nuclear reactions dominate the abundance uncertainties of the most diagnostically important isotopes, and their influence is largely independent of the underlying white-dwarf composition. These results provide guidance for future experimental efforts and for interpreting ejecta compositions in the next eruption of T CrB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter under the conditions of color and electric neutrality at $\beta$- and strong equilibrium, as relevant for neutron stars. By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.</description>

Abstract: Searches for annihilating dark matter are often designed with a specific dark matter candidate in mind. However, the space of potential dark matter models is vast, which raises the question: how can we search for dark matter without making strong assumptions about unknown physics. We present a model-independent approach for measuring dark matter annihilation ratios and branching fractions with $\gamma$-ray event data. By parameterizing the annihilation ratios for seven different channels, we obviate the need to search for a specific dark matter candidate. To demonstrate our approach, we analyse simulated data using the GammaBayes pipeline. Given a 5$\sigma$ signal, we reconstruct the annihilation ratios for five dominant channels to within 95% credibility. This allows us to reconstruct dark matter annihilation/decay channels without presuming any particular model, thus offering a model-independent approach to indirect dark matter searches in $\gamma$-ray astronomy. This approach shows that for masses between 0.3-5 TeV we can probe values below the thermal relic velocity annihilation weighted cross-section allowing a 2$\sigma$ detection for 525 hours of simulated observation data by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory of the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <title>Bondi-like Accretion Flow Dynamics: The Role of Gravitational Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of massive black holes and their coevolution with host galaxies are pivotal areas of modern astrophysics. Spherical accretion onto a central point mass serves as a foundational framework in cosmological simulations, semi-analytical models, and observational studies. In this paper, we extend the classical spherical accretion model by incorporating the gravitational potential of host galaxies, including contributions from stellar components and dark matter halos. Numerical solutions spanning scales from parsecs down to ~ 10 r_s reveal that the flow structure is highly sensitive to the mass and size of the dark matter halo. Adding a small amount of angular momentum to the accreting gas demonstrates that such flows resemble spherical Bondi accretion, with mass accretion rates converging toward the Bondi rate. We find that the low angular momentum flow resembles the spherical Bondi flow, and its mass accretion rate approaches the Bondi accretion rate. Remarkably, due to the presence of dark matter, the mass accretion rate increases by more than ~ %100 compared to analogous hydrodynamic solutions without dark matter. These findings underscore the critical role of stellar and dark matter gravitational potentials in shaping the dynamics and accretion rates of quasi-spherical flows, providing new insights into astrophysical accretion processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a more complete consideration of the theoretical concepts and experimental aspects of the physics of photoproduction interactions involving nuclei. This treatment is based in large part on the most recent and extensive empirical data on particle photoproduction interactions with protons. The implications of photoproduction involving helium nuclei are also treated and compared with photoproduction involving protons. It is found that photoproduction interactions with helium nuclei produce approximately 10% of the number of pions as compared with photoproduction interactions involving protons in astrophysical sources, assuming the cosmological abundance of He. In addition to the production of pions, we also demonstrate the relative effect of excited nucleon p-pi and p-2pi resonances and rho, eta, omega, and K meson production and decay channels that result in neutrino and gamma-ray production. The production of mesons other than pions is shown not to be significant for calculations of astrophysical gamma-ray and neutrino production. It is further shown that, for astrophysical purposes, the Delta(1232) resonance channel clearly dominates. However, a blend of nucleon resonances at 1400 GeV can contribute as much as 20% to the neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with uncertainty quantification and model comparison using Bayesian normalizing flows</title>

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations can be costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate population synthesis runs to enable simulation-based inference from observed catalogs and data augmentation for feature prediction in rarely synthesizable sub-populations. However, flow predictions can be wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work, we develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by implementing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function naturally associated with density estimators, we sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. We demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, inference, and data-augmentation impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. We outline the applications of the proposed methodology in the context of simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and feature prediction, with state-of-the-art binary evolution simulators, now marginalized over model and data uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian inference with non-parametric Gaussian process models to investigate the effective inspiral spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, as a function of primary black hole mass in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3). Our analysis reveals a transition in the population at a primary mass of $46^{+7}_{-5}\,M_\odot$. Beyond this mass, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution broadens, becomes consistent with being symmetric around zero, and has a median of $-0.03^{+0.36}_{-0.59}$ (90\% credibility). These results are consistent with the presence of a pair-instability mass gap that is repopulated by black holes that are the remnant of a previous merger, formed in dense star clusters. However, asymmetric distributions skewed toward positive $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are not excluded by current data. Below the inferred transition mass, we constrain the fraction of second-generation black holes to be $\lesssim 10\%$. These results provide model-independent support for a high-mass and high-spin population of black holes in the data, consistent with earlier work using parametric models. Imminent gravitational-wave data releases will be essential to sharpen constraints on spin symmetry and clarify the origin of the black holes.</description>

      <title>The population of NuSTAR Black Hole X-ray Binaries</title>

Abstract: The spin of a black hole (BH) encodes information about its formation and evolution history. Yet the understanding of the distribution of BH spins in X-ray binaries (XBs), of the models used to measure spin, and of their impact on systematic uncertainties remains incomplete. In this work, we expand on previous analyses of the entire NuSTAR archive of accreting BH XBs. Prior work compiled a sample of 245 spectral fits using the relativistic reflection method for NuSTAR observations of 36 BH systems. Here, we aim to probe two aspects: the connection between BH spin and binary system properties, and the relationships between parameters in the spectral fits. We identify moderate negative correlations between spin uncertainty and both BH mass and system inclination, and a moderate positive correlation with distance. We also point out tentative multidimensional degeneracies between inclination, disk density, Fe abundance, ionization, and the presence or absence of absorption features from ionized outflows linked to disk winds. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive view of the observed distribution of BH spins in XBs, in comparison to spins inferred from gravitational waves. We find that the distribution of BH spins in XBs can be described by a beta distribution with $\alpha=5.66$ and $\beta=1.09$. This data set is highly complex, and the analysis presented here does not fully explore all potential parameter correlations. We make the full data set available in Zenodo to the community to encourage further exploration.</description>

      <title>Dim cores of radio-bright AGN jets: VLBI and Gaia astrometry pinpoint different parsec-scale features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrometry with the very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) allows to determine the position of a point close to the source's brightest compact detail at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet origin close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and discuss possible physical explanations for the low core brightness, such as ineffective particle heating, atypical absorption, or differential Doppler boosting.</description>

      <title>The Mid-infrared Emitting Jet in the Black Hole V404 Cygni in Quiescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of some quiescent black hole X-ray binaries have revealed an excess of mid-infrared (MIR) emission above that expected from their donor stars. In one system, V404 Cygni, this excess has been variously suggested to arise from the accretion disk, circumbinary material, or a compact relativistic jet. Here we present simultaneous James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and complementary multi-wavelength observations undertaken to resolve this uncertainty. We observed large-amplitude 21 $\mu$m variability on short timescales with JWST, particularly a dramatic flare which swiftly rose to $\approx2.4$ mJy, over 10 times the lowest observed MIR flux density. Similar variability was simultaneously observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths with other facilities throughout the campaign. This variability and the flat radio/mm/MIR spectral index ($\alpha = 0.04 \pm 0.01$) suggest that the MIR excess at and longward of 21 $\mu$m in V404 Cyg does not arise from the accretion disk or circumbinary material. Instead, the emission at 21 $\mu$m is dominated by synchrotron radiation from a jet which persists into quiescence. This result reinforces the ubiquity of the disk-jet connection in accreting black holes across a range of masses and accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing electron-neutrino lepton number crossings in core-collapse supernovae: A comparison of methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast neutrino flavor conversion may impact the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. A necessary condition for fast flavor conversion is the presence of crossings in the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossing. Because of the computational costs, flavor-dependent angular distributions are not computed by the vast majority of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations; instead, angular distributions are reconstructed employing approximate methods in post-processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of four methods adopted to diagnose the existence of ELN crossings. For selected post-bounce times, we extract the fluid and thermodynamic properties from spherically symmetric supernova simulations for an $18.6 M_\odot$ progenitor, testing cases with and without muons as well as with and without mixing-length treatment of proto-neutron star convection. We compare the occurrence of crossings in the angular distributions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations with those in distributions reconstructed from angular moments of our Boltzmann solutions by using the maximum entropy and Minerbo schemes, and also with crossings identified via a polynomial weighting function applied to the angular moments. Our results show that the polynomial method and the Minerbo closure scheme have severe limitations. The maximum entropy approach captures most of the forward crossings, although it fails to reproduce or misidentifies crossings in a subset of our models. These findings highlight the need for robust modeling of the neutrino angular properties in order to assess the impact of flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism.</description>

      <title>Constrain magnetar parameters by taking into account the evolutionary effects of radius and moment of inertia with \emph{Swift}/XRT data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some GRBs with X-ray plateau emission. In this work, we systematically analyzed the Swift/XRT data of long GRBs with plateau emission that were detected before 2023 December, and estimated the physical parameters by considering the $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that neglecting the $R/I$ evolutionary effects can lead to systematic overestimation or underestimation of magnetar parameters such as $B_p$, $P_0$, and $\epsilon$ from 20\% to 50\%. We also found that some tight correlations, which can be approximately expressed as $\epsilon\propto P_0^{1.57\pm0.22}$, $\epsilon\propto B_p^{0.97\pm0.13}$, $B_p\propto P_0^{1.30\pm0.16}$, $E_{\rm wind}\propto E_{\rm jet,iso}^{0.83\pm0.07}(E_{\rm jet}^{0.76\pm0.06})$, $P_0\propto E_{\rm jet,iso}^{-0.29\pm0.03}(E_{\rm jet}^{-0.26\pm0.02})$, $B_p\propto E_{\rm jet,iso}^{-0.58\pm0.06}(E_{\rm jet}^{-0.55\pm0.05})$, and $\epsilon\propto E_{\rm jet,iso}^{-0.55\pm0.07}(E_{\rm jet}^{-0.52\pm0.06})$ for our selected EoSs. The universal correlations suggest that a nascent magnetar with the faster $P_0$, lower $B_p$, and lower $\epsilon$ are more inclined to power a more energetic GRB jet, and the $\epsilon$ and $P_0$ of newborn magnetar are likely to originate from the magnetically induced distortion and correspond to the equilibrium spin period as a result of interaction between the magnetar and its accretion disk, respectively. Finally, we found that the GW signals from the remnants of those GW-dominated GRBs with redshift measurements cannot reach aLIGO sensitivity threshold, and only two cases (GRBs 150323A and 170607A) can reach ET sensitivity threshold. Future GW observations could not only offer the first smoking gun that a protomagnetar can serve as the central engine of GRBs but also play a crucial role in precisely constraining the neutron star EoS.</description>

      <title>Electron-neutrino lepton number crossings: Variations with the supernova core physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial ingredient affecting fast neutrino flavor conversion in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is the shape of the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN). The presence of an ELN crossing signals favorable conditions for flavor conversion. However, the dependence of ELN crossings on the SN properties is only partially understood. We investigate a suite of 12 spherically symmetric neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of the core collapse of a SN with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$; each model employs different microphysics (i.e., three different nuclear equations of state, with and without muon creation) and includes or not a mixing-length treatment for proto-neutron star convection. We solve the Boltzmann equations to compute the neutrino angular distributions relying on static fluid properties extracted from each of the SN simulations in our suite for six selected post-bounce times. We explore the dependence of the ELN distributions on the SN microphysics and proto-neutron star convection. We find that the latter shifts the proto-neutron star radius outwards, favoring the appearance of ELN crossings at larger radii. On the other hand, muon creation causes proto-neutron star contraction, facilitating the occurrence of ELN crossings at smaller radii. These effects mildly depend on the nuclear equation of state. Our findings highlight the subtle impact of the SN microphysics, proto-neutron star convection, and neutrino transport on the ELN angular distributions.</description>

      <title>A Deep VLA Search for a Persistent Radio Counterpart to the One-off FRB 20250316A</title>

Abstract: Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 20250316A, detected by CHIME on 2025 March 16 with a fluence of $1.7\pm0.1~\mathrm{Jy\,ms}$ and a dispersion measure of $161.3\pm0.4~\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$, ranks among the brightest extragalactic FRBs at $\sim 40$ Mpc. We obtained deep Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array follow-up at 15~GHz on 2025 April 5 and 9 and find no persistent radio source (PRS). Our best image reaches an rms of $2.8~\mu\mathrm{Jy\,beam^{-1}}$, yielding a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $&lt;8.4~\mu\mathrm{Jy}$ at the FRB position, corresponding to $\nu L_\nu &lt; 2.4\times10^{35}~\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. These results represent among the most stringent constraints for a non-repeating FRB, lying $\gtrsim 3$ orders of magnitude below the $\nu L_\nu$ of compact persistent radio sources around well-studied repeaters, thereby disfavoring bright magnetar-nebula scenarios and pointing to low-density, weakly magnetized environments. Interpreting our limit through pulsar-/magnetar-wind synchrotron frameworks places joint constraints on ambient density and engine power. If the empirical PRS--rotation-measure trend reported for repeaters extends to one-off sources, our limit implies $\vert \mathrm{RM} \vert \lesssim 30~\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$, consistent with a clean magneto-ionic sight line and progenitor channels such as neutron-star mergers or giant flares from older magnetars.</description>

      <title>Pulsations change the structures of massive stars before they explode: interpreting the nearby supernova SN 2023ixf</title>

Abstract: Massive red supergiants (RSGs) are known to become hydrodynamically unstable before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that inferring core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs is inadvisable, as these can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. We find that pulsations can naturally lead to ``early-excess" emission in SN light curves and to variations in early photospheric velocities, which can help break degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN~2023ixf, for which a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and post-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model, whereas hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at early times is insufficient to break all degeneracies, but we find constraints on the explosion phase. We find no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN~2024ggi progenitor, as it matches Spitzer's orbital period. This study underscores the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models. It implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data and resources from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), we constructed two high-precision catalogs: the updated 4FGL-Xiang-DR2 (DR2) and a supplementary version of the fifth edition of Roma-BZCAT (5BZCAT\_err), both featuring refined positional uncertainties. We performed a spatial cross-identification between the two catalogs and developed a systematic three-step analytical pipeline: (1) efficient retrieval of positional uncertainties and multi-wavelength fluxes from 5BZCAT\_err, (2) calculation of spatial association probabilities with DR2, and (3) statistical modeling of multi-band fluxes, using the Box--Cox transformation and a truncated normal distribution. Through this process, we identified 17 new blazar candidates. Fermi-LAT analysis reveals that, except for J1043.7+5323, which exhibits significant flux variability above 100 MeV, the remaining sources display stable fluxes, without apparent spatial extension or spectral curvature. Multi-wavelength flux modeling shows that 15 of the 17 sources fall within the 2$\sigma$ confidence interval of the distribution model, demonstrating strong statistical consistency with known blazar samples. As Fermi-LAT data continues to accumulate, the remaining two sources are expected to converge toward the high-confidence region, providing further support for the common-source hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigation of neutrino spin oscillation in the gravitational fields of black holes (BHs) is one of the interesting topics in neutrino physics. On the other hand, in recent years, many studies have been devoted to the exploration of different physical phenomena in higher dimensions. Non-commutative geometry has also been focus of researchers in recent years to explore the structure of space-time more deeply and accurately. In this work, the neutrino spin oscillation in the non-commutative higher dimensional gravitational fields of Schwarzschild and Reissner Nordstrom metrics is studied. The effects of noncommutativity of space are calculated and its role in different dimensions is discussed. Considering the fact that in the non-commutative space, for certain values of eta, no event horizon exists and consequently, there will be no BH, some upper bounds for the non-commutative parameter are obtained.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: Constraints on AGN Feedback in Galaxy Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of AGN feedback, on the entropy and characteristic temperature measurements of galaxy groups detected in the SRG/eROSITA's first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) to shed light on the characteristics of the feedback mechanisms. We analyze deeper eROSITA observations of 1178 galaxy groups detected in eRASS1. We divide the sample into 271 subsamples and extract average thermodynamic properties, including electron density, temperature, and entropy at three characteristic radii along with the integrated temperature by jointly analyzing X-ray images and spectra following a Bayesian approach. We present the tightest constraints on the impact of AGN feedback through our average entropy and characteristic temperature measurements of the largest group sample used in X-ray studies, incorporating major systematics in our analysis. We find that entropy shows an increasing trend with temperature in the form of a power-law-like relation at the higher intra-group medium temperatures, while for the low mass groups, a slight flattening is observed on the average entropy. Overall, the observed entropy measurements agree well with the earlier measurements in the literature. The comparisons with the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (MillenniumTNG, Magneticum, OWL simulations) after the applications of the selection function calibrated for our galaxy groups reveal that observed entropy profiles in the cores are below the predictions of simulations. At the mid-region, the entropy measurements agree well with the Magneticum simulations, whereas the predictions of MillenniumTNG and OWL simulations fall below observations. At the outskirts, the overall agreement between the observations and simulations improves, with Magneticum simulations reproducing the observations the best. Our measurements will pave the way for more realistic AGN feedback implementations in simulations.</description>

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the transition region, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in weakly and strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior in strongly magnetized cases. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>Antinuclei from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light primordial black holes (PBHs) may have originated in the early Universe, and could contribute to the dark matter in the Universe. Their Hawking evaporation into particles could eventually lead to the production of antinuclei, which propagate and arrive at Earth as cosmic rays with a flux peaked at GeV energies. We revisit here the antiproton and antideuteron signatures from PBH evaporation, relying on a lognormal PBH mass distribution, state-of-the-art propagation models, and an improved coalescence model for fusion into antideuterons. Our predictions are then compared with AMS-02 data on the antiproton flux. We find that the AMS-02 antiproton data severely constrain the Galactic PBH density, setting bounds that depend significantly on the parameters of the lognormal mass distribution, and that are comparable to or slightly stronger than bounds set from diverse messengers. We also discuss prospects for future detection of antideuterons. Given the bounds from AMS-02 antiproton data, we predict that if antideuterons were to be measured by AMS-02 or GAPS, since the secondary contribution is subdominant, they would clearly be a signal of new physics, only part of which could, however, be explained by PBH evaporation.</description>

      <title>Early release of low-frequency atlas of continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the public release of the low-frequency atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering signals with frequencies from 20 Hz to 200 Hz and frequency derivatives from -5e-11 to 5e-11 Hz/s. Compared to the previous atlas releases, this version demonstrates significant improvements in sensitivity and sky resolution. In the most sensitive region even the worst-case upper limits on gravitational wave strain are below 1e-25. The atlas data is being released ahead of the completion of the full follow-up analysis.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of the divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of the curvature parameter and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Dark Sector Electroweak Baryogenesis In Light Of The Galactic Center Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a model of electroweak baryogenesis that includes a dark matter candidate, and sequesters the new CP violation required to produce the baryon asymmetry in a dark sector. The model can explain the baryon asymmetry, dark matter relic density, and the long-standing excess of gamma rays from the galactic center. The first order electroweak phase transition induced by the new physics can give rise to gravitational waves that may be observed in future experiments. The model predicts dark matter signals in direct detectors, and a significant contribution to the Higgs boson invisible decay width.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hill's mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a model to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>
