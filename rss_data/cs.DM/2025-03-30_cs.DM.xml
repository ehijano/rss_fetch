      <title>Valid Cuts for the Design of Potential-based Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of a cost minimal network for flows obeying physical laws is an important problem for the design of electricity, water, hydrogen, and natural gas infrastructures. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program with potential-based flows. The non-convexity of the constraints stemming from the potential-based flow model together with the binary variables indicating the decision to build a connection make these programs challenging to solve. We develop a novel class of valid inequalities on the fractional relaxations of the binary variables. Further, we show that this class of inequalities can be separated in polynomial time for solutions to a fractional relaxation. This makes it possible to incorporate these inequalities into a branch-and-cut framework. The advantage of these inequalities is lastly demonstrated in a computational study on the design of real-world gas transport networks.</description>

      <title>On Finding All Connected Maximum-Sized Common Subgraphs in Multiple Labeled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact algorithm for computing the connected Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) across multiple graphs, where edges or vertices may additionally be labeled to account for possible atom types or bond types, a classical labeling used in molecular graphs. Our approach leverages modular product graphs and a modified Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate maximal cliques, ensuring all intermediate solutions are retained. A pruning heuristic efficiently reduces the modular product size, improving computational feasibility. Additionally, we introduce a graph ordering strategy based on graph-kernel similarity measures to optimize the search process. Our method is particularly relevant for bioinformatics and cheminformatics, where identifying conserved structural motifs in molecular graphs is crucial. Empirical results on molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach is exact, scalable and fast.</description>

      <title>Path Cover, Hamiltonicity, and Independence Number: An FPT Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classic theorem of Gallai and Milgram (1960) asserts that for every graph G, the vertex set of G can be partitioned into at most \alpha(G) vertex-disjoint paths, where \alpha(G) is the maximum size of an independent set in G. The proof of Gallai--Milgram's theorem is constructive and yields a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a covering of G by at most \alpha(G) vertex-disjoint paths.
  We prove the following algorithmic extension of Gallai--Milgram's theorem for undirected graphs: determining whether an undirected graph can be covered by fewer than \alpha(G) - k vertex-disjoint paths is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by k. More precisely, we provide an algorithm that, for an n-vertex graph G and an integer parameter k \ge 1, runs in time 2^{k^{O(k^4)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}, and outputs a path cover P of G. Furthermore, it:
  - either correctly reports that P is a minimum-size path cover,
  - or outputs, together with P, an independent set of size |P| + k certifying that P contains at most \alpha(G) - k paths.
  A key subroutine in our algorithm is an FPT algorithm, parameterized by \alpha(G), for deciding whether G contains a Hamiltonian path. This result is of independent interest -- prior to our work, no polynomial-time algorithm for deciding Hamiltonicity was known even for graphs with independence number at most 3. Moreover, the techniques we develop apply to a wide array of problems in undirected graphs, including Hamiltonian Cycle, Path Cover, Largest Linkage, and Topological Minor Containment. We show that all these problems are FPT when parameterized by the independence number of the graph.
  Notably, the independence number parameterization, which describes graph's density, departs from the typical flow of research in parameterized complexity, which focuses on parameters describing graph's sparsity, like treewidth or vertex cover.</description>
