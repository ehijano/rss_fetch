      <title>Structure Theorems (and Fast Algorithms) for List Recovery of Subspace-Design Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: List recovery of error-correcting codes has emerged as a fundamental notion with broad applications across coding theory and theoretical computer science. Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) and univariate multiplicity codes are explicit constructions which can be efficiently list-recovered up to capacity, namely a fraction of errors approaching $1-R$ where $R$ is the code rate.
  Chen and Zhang and related works showed that folded Reed-Solomon codes and linear codes must have list sizes exponential in $1/\epsilon$ for list-recovering from an error-fraction $1-R-\epsilon$. These results suggest that one cannot list-recover FRS codes in time that is also polynomial in $1/\epsilon$. In contrast to such limitations, we show, extending algorithmic advances of Ashvinkumar, Habib, and Srivastava for list decoding, that even if the lists in the case of list-recovery are large, they are highly structured. In particular, we can output a compact description of a set of size only $\ell^{O((\log \ell)/\epsilon)}$ which contains the relevant list, while running in time only polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ (the previously known compact description due to Guruswami and Wang had size $\approx n^{\ell/\epsilon}$). We also improve on the state-of-the-art algorithmic results for the task of list-recovery.</description>

      <title>Expectations in Expectation Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a widely used message-passing algorithm that decomposes a global inference problem into multiple local ones. It approximates marginal distributions (beliefs) using intermediate functions (messages). While beliefs must be proper probability distributions that integrate to one, messages may have infinite integral values. In Gaussian-projected EP, such messages take a Gaussian form and appear as if they have "negative" variances. Although allowed within the EP framework, these negative-variance messages can impede algorithmic progress.
  In this paper, we investigate EP in linear models and analyze the relationship between the corresponding beliefs. Based on the analysis, we propose both non-persistent and persistent approaches that prevent the algorithm from being blocked by messages with infinite integral values.
  Furthermore, by examining the relationship between the EP messages in linear models, we develop an additional approach that avoids the occurrence of messages with infinite integral values.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Matched Filtering for Sensing With Communication Signals in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of the adaptive matched filtering (AMF) in cluttered environments, particularly when operating with superimposed signals. Since the instantaneous signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) is a random variable dependent on the data payload, using it directly as a design objective poses severe practical challenges, such as prohibitive computational burdens and signaling overhead. To address this, we propose shifting the optimization objective from an instantaneous to a statistical metric, which focuses on maximizing the average SCNR over all possible payloads. Due to its analytical intractability, we leverage tools from random matrix theory (RMT) to derive an asymptotic approximation for the average SCNR, which remains accurate even in moderate-dimensional regimes. A key finding from our theoretical analysis is that, for a fixed modulation basis, the PSK achieves a superior average SCNR compared to QAM and the pure Gaussian constellation. Furthermore, for any given constellation, the OFDM achieves a higher average SCNR than SC and AFDM. Then, we propose two pilot design schemes to enhance system performance: a Data-Payload-Dependent (DPD) scheme and a Data-Payload-Independent (DPI) scheme. The DPD approach maximizes the instantaneous SCNR for each transmission. Conversely, the DPI scheme optimizes the average SCNR, offering a flexible trade-off between sensing performance and implementation complexity. Then, we develop two dedicated optimization algorithms for DPD and DPI schemes. In particular, for the DPD problem, we employ fractional optimization and the KKT conditions to derive a closed-form solution. For the DPI problem, we adopt a manifold optimization approach to handle the inherent rank-one constraint efficiently. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Tradeoff of Joint Communication and QCD: The Monostatic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental tradeoff between communication and quickest change detection (QCD) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems under a monostatic setup. We introduce a novel Joint Communication and quickest Change subblock coding Strategy (JCCS) that leverages feedback to adapt coding dynamically based on real-time state estimation. The achievable rate-delay region is characterized using state-dependent mutual information and KL divergence, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing the interplay between communication performance and detection delay. Moreover, we provide a partial converse demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of the proposed detection algorithm within the JCCS framework. To illustrate the practical implications, we analyze binary and MIMO Gaussian channels, revealing insights into achieving optimal tradeoffs in ISAC system design.</description>

      <title>On Discrete Ambiguity Functions of Random Communication Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a fundamental characterization of the discrete ambiguity functions (AFs) of random communication waveforms under arbitrary orthonormal modulation with random constellation symbols, which serve as a key metric for evaluating the delay-Doppler sensing performance in future ISAC applications. A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations. Finally, four representative waveforms, namely, SC, OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM, are examined under both frameworks, and all theoretical results are verified through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Skew polynomial representations of matrix algebras and applications to coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the existing skew polynomial representations of matrix algebras which are direct sum of matrix spaces over division rings. In this representation, the sum-rank distance between two tuples of matrices is captured by a weight function on their associated skew polynomials, defined through degrees and greatest common right divisors with the polynomial that defines the representation. We exploit this representation to construct new families of maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes over finite and infinite fields, and over division rings. These constructions generalize many of the known existing constructions of MSRD codes as well as of optimal codes in the rank and in the Hamming metric. As a byproduct, in the case of finite fields we obtain new families of MDS codes which are linear over a subfield and whose length is close to the field size.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of the Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform for Limited Data Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT) exploits one-dimensional Wasserstein transport and the Radon transform to represent prominent features in images. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. To make the R-CDT invariant under arbitrary affine transformations, a two-step normalization of the R-CDT has been proposed in our earlier works. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a family of generalized normalizations to enhance flexibility for applications. Second, we study multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean settings by making use of generalized Radon transforms. We prove that our novel feature representations are invariant under certain transformations and allow for linear separation in feature space. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments based on 2d images, 3d shapes and 3d rotation matrices, showing near perfect classification accuracies and clustering results.</description>

      <title>Locally Recoverable Codes with availability from a family of fibered surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Locally Recoverable Codes (LRCs) with availability $2$ from a family of fibered surfaces. To obtain the locality and availability properties, and to estimate the minimum distance of the codes, we combine techniques coming from the theory of one-variable function fields and from the theory of fibrations on surfaces. When the locality parameter is $r=3$, we obtain a sharp bound on the minimum distance of the codes. In that case, we give a geometric interpretation of our codes in terms of doubly elliptic surfaces. In particular, this provides the first instance of an error correcting code constructed using a (doubly elliptic) K3 surface.</description>

      <title>Security Analysis of Integer Learning with Errors with Rejection Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At ASIACRYPT 2018, a digital attack based on linear least squares was introduced for a variant of the learning with errors (LWE) problem which omits modular reduction known as the integer learning with errors problem (ILWE). In this paper, we present a theoretical and experimental study of the effectiveness of the attack when applied directly to small parameter ILWE instances found in popular digital signature schemes such as CRYSTALS-Dilithium which utilize rejection sampling. Unlike other studies which form ILWE instances based on additional information obtained from side-channel attacks, we take a more direct approach to the problem by constructing our ILWE instance from only the obtained signatures. We outline and introduce novel techniques in our simulation designs such as modular polynomial arithmetic via matrices in $\mathbb{R}$, as well as algorithms for handling large sample sizes efficiently. Our experimental results reinforce the proclaimed security of signature schemes based on ILWE. We additionally discuss the implications of our work and digital signatures as a whole in regards to real-world applications such as in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Explainability of Graph Neural Networks Through Conceptual and Structural Analyses and Their Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing data with graph structures. The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.</description>

      <title>A Distribution Testing Approach to Clustering Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the following distribution clustering problem: Given a hidden partition of $k$ distributions into two groups, such that the distributions within each group are the same, and the two distributions associated with the two clusters are $\varepsilon$-far in total variation, the goal is to recover the partition. We establish upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity for two fundamental cases: (1) when one of the cluster's distributions is known, and (2) when both are unknown. Our upper and lower bounds characterize the sample complexity's dependence on the domain size $n$, number of distributions $k$, size $r$ of one of the clusters, and distance $\varepsilon$. In particular, we achieve tightness with respect to $(n,k,r,\varepsilon)$ (up to an $O(\log k)$ factor) for all regimes.</description>

      <title>Axial Symmetric Navier Stokes Equations and the Beltrami /anti Beltrami spectrum in view of Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I further continue an investigation on Beltrami Flows began in 2015 with A. Sorin and amply reprised and developed in 2022 with M. Trigiante. Instead of a compact $3$-torus $T^3=\mathbb{R}^3/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a crystallographic lattice, as done in previous work, here I considered flows confined in a cylinder with identified opposite bases. In this topology I considered axial symmetric flows and found a complete basis of axial symmetric harmonic $1$-forms that, for each energy level, decomposes into six components: two Beltrami, two anti-Beltrami and two closed forms. These objects, that are written in terms of trigonometric and Bessel functions, constitute a function basis for an $L^2$ space of axial symmetric flows. I have presented a general scheme for the search of axial symmetric solutions of Navier Stokes equation by reducing the latter to an hierachy of quadratic relations on the development coefficients of the flow in the above described functional basis. It is proposed that the coefficients can be determined by means of a Physics Informed like Neural Network optimization recursive algorithm. Indeed the present paper provides the theoretical foundations for such a algorithmic construction that is planned for a future publication.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive study on the applications of denoising diffusion models for wireless systems is provided. The article highlights the capabilities of diffusion models in learning complicated signal distributions, modeling wireless channels, and denoising and reconstructing distorted signals. First, fundamental working mechanism of diffusion models is introduced. Then the recent advances in applying diffusion models to wireless systems are reviewed. Next, two case studies are provided, where conditional diffusion models (CDiff) are proposed for data reconstruction enhancement, covering both the conventional digital communication systems, as well as the semantic communication (SemCom) setups. The first case study highlights about 10 dB improvement in data reconstruction under low-SNR regimes, while mitigating the need to transmit redundant bits for error correction codes in digital systems. The second study further extends the case to a SemCom setup, where diffusion autoencoders showcase superior performance compared to legacy autoencoders and variational autoencoder (VAE) architectures. Finally, future directions and existing challenges are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dual-Source SPIR over a noiseless MAC without Data Replication or Shared Randomness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information-theoretically secure Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR) is known to be infeasible over noiseless channels with a single server. Known solutions to overcome this infeasibility involve additional resources such as database replication, shared randomness, or noisy channels. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for achieving SPIR with information-theoretic security guarantees, without relying on shared randomness, noisy channels, or data replication. Specifically, we demonstrate that it is sufficient to use a noiseless binary adder multiple-access channel, where inputs are controlled by two non-colluding servers and the output is observed by the client, alongside a public noiseless communication channel between the client and the servers. Furthermore, in this setting, we characterize the optimal file rates, i.e., the file lengths normalized by the number of channel uses, that can be transferred.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Secure Multiplication with Erasures and Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a private distributed multiplication problem involving N computation nodes and T colluding nodes. Shamir's secret sharing algorithm provides perfect information-theoretic privacy, while requiring an honest majority, i.e., N \ge 2T + 1. Recent work has investigated approximate computation and characterized privacy-accuracy trade-offs for the honest minority setting N \le 2T for real-valued data, quantifying privacy leakage via the differential privacy (DP) framework and accuracy via the mean squared error. However, it does not incorporate the error correction capabilities of Shamir's secret-sharing algorithm. This paper develops a new polynomial-based coding scheme for secure multiplication with an honest minority, and characterizes its achievable privacy-utility tradeoff, showing that the tradeoff can approach the converse bound as closely as desired. Unlike previous schemes, the proposed scheme inherits the capability of the Reed-Solomon (RS) code to tolerate erasures and adversaries. We utilize a modified Berlekamp-Welch algorithm over the real number field to detect adversarial nodes.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Driven Semantic NOMA for Image Transmission with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a promising 6G enabler beyond conventional bit-level transmission, semantic communication can considerably reduce required bandwidth resources, while its combination with multiple access requires further exploration. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD) semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These results highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual metrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image recovery.</description>

      <title>Indoor Fluid Antenna Systems Enabled by Layout-Specific Modeling and Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15006v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) revolutionizes wireless communications via utilizing position-flexible antennas that dynamically optimize channel conditions and mitigate multipath fading. This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, in which signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we investigate the channel modeling and the joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose a layout-specific channel model, and employ the novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for tackling the optimization problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our model achieves an 83.3% reduction in computation time with an approximately 3 dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our model allows for a closed-form antenna position solution with near-optimal performance. For the joint optimization problem, our GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 50.8% computational resources of PPO, thanks to its group advantage estimation. Simulation results show that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Han's Fourier Entropy-Influence Inequality via an Information-Theoretic Proof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We strengthen Han's Fourier entropy-influence inequality $$ H[\widehat{f}] \leq C_{1}I(f) + C_{2}\sum_{i\in [n]}I_{i}(f)\ln\frac{1}{I_{i}(f)} $$ originally proved for $\{-1,1\}$-valued Boolean functions with $C_{1}=3+2\ln 2$ and $C_{2}=1$. We show, by a short information-theoretic proof, that it in fact holds with sharp constants $C_{1}=C_{2}=1$ for all real-valued Boolean functions of unit $L^{2}$-norm, thereby establishing the inequality as an elementary structural property of Shannon entropy and influence.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, we introduce curved neural networks as a class of models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Curse of Slicing: Why Sliced Mutual Information is a Deceptive Measure of Statistical Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) is widely used as a scalable alternative to mutual information for measuring non-linear statistical dependence. Despite its advantages, such as faster convergence, robustness to high dimensionality, and nullification only under statistical independence, we demonstrate that SMI is highly susceptible to data manipulation and exhibits counterintuitive behavior. Through extensive benchmarking and theoretical analysis, we show that SMI saturates easily, fails to detect increases in statistical dependence, prioritizes redundancy over informative content, and in some cases, performs worse than correlation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet is a good candidate to tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to bad behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.</description>

      <title>AoI-based Scheduling of Correlated Sources for Timely Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a real-time remote inference system where multiple correlated sources transmit observations over a communication channel to a receiver. The receiver utilizes these observations to infer multiple time-varying targets. Due to limited communication resources, the delivered observations may not be fresh. To quantify data freshness, we employ the Age of Information (AoI) metric. To minimize the inference error, we aim to design a signal-agnostic scheduling policy that leverages AoI without requiring knowledge of the actual target values or the source observations. This scheduling problem is a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with a non-separable penalty function. Unlike traditional RMABs, the correlation among sources introduces a unique challenge: the penalty function of each source depends on the AoI of other correlated sources, preventing the problem from decomposing into multiple independent Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a key step in applying traditional RMAB solutions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that approximates the penalty function for each source and establishes an analytical bound on the approximation error. We then develop scheduling policies for two scenarios: (i) full knowledge of the penalty functions and (ii) no knowledge of the penalty functions. For the case of known penalty functions, we present an upper bound on the optimality gap that highlights the impact of the correlation parameter and the system size. For the case of unknown penalty functions and signal distributions, we develop an online learning approach that utilizes bandit feedback to learn an online Maximum Gain First policy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed policies in minimizing inference error and achieving scalability in the number of sources.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hoeffding and Chernoff: Trading conclusiveness for advantages in quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultimate limits of quantum state discrimination are often thought to be captured by asymptotic bounds that restrict the achievable error probabilities, notably the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. Here we study hypothesis testing protocols that are permitted a probability of producing an inconclusive discrimination outcome, and investigate their performance when this probability is suitably constrained. We show that even by allowing an arbitrarily small probability of inconclusiveness, the limits imposed by the quantum Hoeffding and Chernoff bounds can be significantly exceeded. This completely circumvents the conventional trade-offs between error exponents in hypothesis testing while incurring only a vanishingly small overhead over conventional approaches. Such improvements over standard state discrimination are robust and can be obtained even when an exponentially vanishing probability of inconclusive outcomes is demanded. Relaxing the constraints on the inconclusive probability can enable even larger advantages, but this comes at a price. We show a 'strong converse' property of this setting: targeting error exponents beyond those achievable with vanishing inconclusiveness necessarily forces the probability of inconclusive outcomes to converge to one. By exactly quantifying the rate of this convergence, we give a complete characterisation of the trade-offs between error exponents and rates of conclusive outcome probabilities. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive asymptotic picture of how the allowance for inconclusive measurement outcomes reshapes optimal quantum hypothesis testing.</description>
