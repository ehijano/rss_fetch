      <title>Femtosecond Core-Level Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transfer is a fundamental phenomenon in biology and chemistry, and involves the movement of charge through a system driven by nuclear dynamics. Because of the involvement of nuclear motion, it is generally assumed that charge transfer will occur on a time-scale of some few tens-to-hundreds of femtoseconds. Using the example of ethylene excited to its $1s\pi^{*}$ manifold, we demonstrate that ultrafast, few-femtosecond core-level charge transfer may occur following core-excitation, driven by the formation of electronic coherences by non-adiabatic dynamics. Here, transfer of core-electron density from one side of the molecule to the other is driven by a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and results in core-hole localisation occuring within 5 fs, followed by core-hole delocalisation, all within the Auger decay window. These results serve to demonstrate that ultra-fast core-level charge transfer driven by nuclear dynamics may occur on the same timescale as purely electronic, i.e., charge migration, dynamics following core-excitation.</description>

      <title>Modified Opposite-Spin-Scaled Double-Hybrid Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential performance improvements of double-hybrid density functionals by replacing the standard opposite-spin-scaled MP2 (SOS-MP2) with the modified opposite-spin-scaled MP2 (MOS-MP2) in the nonlocal correlation component. Using the large and diverse GMTKN55 dataset, we find that MOS-double hybrids provide significantly better accuracy compared to SOS-MP2-based double hybrids when empirical dispersion correction is not employed. The non-covalent interaction subsets account for the majority of this improvement. Adding the DFT-D4 dispersion correction to MOS-type double hybrids does not provide any superior performance over conventional dispersion-corrected SOS-MP2-based double hybrids. Nevertheless, for nine tested transition metal sets, dispersion-corrected spin-component-scaled (SCS) double hybrids are still significantly better than any MOS-double hybrid functional.</description>

      <title>RiD-kit: Software package designed to do enhanced sampling using reinforced dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing an efficient method to accelerate the speed of molecular dynamics is a central theme in the field of molecular simulation. One category among the methods are collective-variable-based methods, which rely on predefined collective variables (CVs). The difficulty of selecting a few important CVs hinders the methods to be applied to large systems easily. Here we present a CV-based enhanced sampling method RiD-kit, which could handle a large number of CVs and perform efficient sampling. The method could be applied to various kinds of systems, including biomolecules, chemical reactions and materials. In this protocol, we guide the users through all phases of the RiD-kit workflow, from preparing the input files, setting the simulation parameters and analyzing the results. The RiD-kit workflow provides an efficient and user-friendly command line tool which could submit jobs to various kinds of platforms including the high-performance computers (HPC), cloud server and local machines.</description>

      <title>Prediction rigidities for data-driven chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread application of machine learning (ML) to the chemical sciences is making it very important to understand how the ML models learn to correlate chemical structures with their properties, and what can be done to improve the training efficiency whilst guaranteeing interpretability and transferability. In this work, we demonstrate the wide utility of prediction rigidities, a family of metrics derived from the loss function, in understanding the robustness of ML model predictions. We show that the prediction rigidities allow the assessment of the model not only at the global level, but also on the local or the component-wise level at which the intermediate (e.g. atomic, body-ordered, or range-separated) predictions are made. We leverage these metrics to understand the learning behavior of different ML models, and to guide efficient dataset construction for model training. We finally implement the formalism for a ML model targeting a coarse-grained system to demonstrate the applicability of the prediction rigidities to an even broader class of atomistic modeling problems.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilized form chirality in curved rod nematics: structure and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite almost a century of anticipation, polar uniaxial nematics were only recently discovered and shown to adopt a chiral supramolecular structure. Monte Carlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such shapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and nematic phases. The nematic exhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique, polar, $\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a mirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods-form chirality. A comprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the nematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation violates splay- and twist-bend continuum elasticity. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the isotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar director in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form chirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems from the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature nematic ''$\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.</description>

      <title>Quantized Embedding Approaches for Collective Strong Coupling -- Connecting ab initio and macroscopic QED to Simple Models in Polaritonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective light-matter interactions have been used to control chemistry and energy transfer, yet accessible approaches that combine ab initio methodology with large many-body quantum optical systems are missing due to the fast increase in computational cost for explicit simulations. We introduce an accessible ab initio quantum embedding concept for many-body quantum optical systems that allows to treat the collective coupling of molecular many-body systems effectively in the spirit of macroscopic QED while keeping the rigor of ab initio quantum chemistry for the molecular structure. Our approach fully includes the quantum fluctuations of the polaritonic field and yet remains much simpler and more intuitive than complex embedding approaches such as dynamical mean-field theory. We illustrate the underlying assumptions by comparison to the Tavis--Cummings model. The intuitive application of the quantized embedding approach and its transparent limitations offer a practical framework for the field of ab initio polaritonic chemistry to describe collective effects in realistic molecular ensembles.</description>

      <title>Electron rescollisional excitation of OCS$^+$ in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron-photoion coincidence momentum imaging has been performed to investigate excitation processes on dissociative ionization of OCS, OCS $\to$ OCS$^+$ + e$^-$ $\to$ OC + S$^+$ + e$^-$, in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields. The electron kinetic energy spectra depend on coincidentally produced ion species, OCS$^+$ or S$^+$. The observed electron momentum distribution shows a clear asymmetry along the laser polarization direction with a 2$\pi$-oscillation period as a function of the phase difference in $\omega + 2\omega$ laser fields. The asymmetry of the electron emission in the OCS$^+$ channel flips at the electron kinetic energy of 8.2 eV where the dominant scattering direction switches from forward to backward. In the S$^+$ channel, the asymmetry flip occurs at the lower kinetic energy of 4.2 eV, and this shift corresponds to an inelastic scattering process. In comparison with a classical trajectory Monte-Carlo simulation, it has been clarified that the shift of the electron kinetic energy at which the asymmetry flip occurs corresponds to the excitation energy of the parent ion and indicates contributions of electron recollisional excitation to form the fragment ion in intense laser fields.</description>

      <title>Achieving Accurate Ground-States for Metals from Converged Coupled Cluster Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-electron correlation methods offer a systematic approach to predicting material properties with high precision. However, practically attaining accurate ground-state properties for bulk metals presents significant challenges. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to reach the thermodynamic limit of the total ground-state energy of metals using coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that the coupling between long-range and short-range contributions to the correlation energy is sufficiently weak, enabling us to restrict long-range contributions to low-energy excitations in a controllable way. Leveraging this insight, we calculate the surface energy of aluminum and platinum (111), providing numerical evidence that coupled cluster theory is well-suited for modeling metallic materials, particularly in surface science. Notably, our results exhibit convergence with respect to finite-size effects, basis-set size, and coupled cluster expansion, yielding excellent agreement with experimental data. This paves the way for more efficient coupled cluster calculations for large systems and a broader utilization of the theory in realistic metallic models of materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster based on Lie-algebraic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) ans\"atze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce $k$-NI-DUCC, a fixed and Non-iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster compact ansatz, based on specific $"k"$ sets of "qubit" excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with $n$ being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs $"k"$ products of the exponential of $\mathcal{O}(n)$- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each operator has a length $p$. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit, $\mathcal{O}(knp)$, suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H$_6$ and BeH$_2$, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact Full Configuration Interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. While NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, the classical computational cost of constructing the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.</description>

Abstract: Lipid membranes have complex compositions and modeling the thermodynamic properties of multi-component lipid systems remains a remote goal. In this work we attempt to describe the thermodynamics of binary lipid mixtures by mapping coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to two-dimensional simple fluid mixtures. By computing and analysing the density fluctuations of this model lipid bilayer we determine the numerical value of the quadratic coupling term appearing in a model of regular solutions for the DPPC-DLiPC pair of lipids at three different compositions. Our methodology is general and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Towards the "puzzle" of Chromium dimer Cr$_2$: predicting the Born-Oppenheimer rovibrational spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimentally-observed non-trivial electronic structure of the Cr$_2$ dimer has made the calculation of its potential energy curve a theoretical challenge in the last decades. By matching the perturbation theory at small internuclear distances $R$ and the multipole expansion at large distances $R$ (supposedly both of asymptotic nature), and by adding a few Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) turning points, extracted from experimental data by Casey-Leopold (1993), the analytic form of the potential energy curve for the ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ of the Cr$_2$ dimer is found for the first time for the whole range of internuclear distances $R$. This has the form of a two-point Pad\'e approximant and provides an accuracy of 3-4 decimal digits in 29 experimental vibrational energies. The resulting ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ potential curve supports 19694 rovibrational states with a maximal vibrational number $\nu_\text{max}=104$ at zero angular momentum and with a maximal angular momentum $L_\text{max}=312$ with energies $&gt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}, and additionally 218 weakly-bound states (close to the dissociation limit) with energies $&lt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}.</description>

      <title>Implementation of time-dependent Hartree Fock in real space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) is one of the fundamental post-Hartree-Fock (HF) methods to describe excited states. In its Tamm-Dancoff form, equivalent to Configuration Interaction Singles, it is still widely used and particularly applicable to big molecules where more accurate methods may be unfeasibly expensive. However, it is rarely implemented in real space, mostly because of the expensive nature of the exact-exchange potential in real space. Compared to widely used Gaussian-type orbitals (GTO) basis sets, real space often offers easier implementation of equations and more systematic convergence of Rydberg states, as well as favorable scaling, effective domain parallelization, flexible boundary conditions, and ability to treat model systems. We implemented TDHF in the Octopus real-space code as a step toward linear-response hybrid time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), other post-HF methods, and ensemble density-functional theory methods involving exact exchange. Calculation of HF's non-local exact exchange is very expensive in real space. We overcome this limitation with Octopus' implementation of Adaptively Compressed Exchange (ACE), and find the appropriate mixing scheme and starting point to complete the ground-state calculation in a practical amount of time, and thus enable TDHF. We compared our results to those from GTOs on a set of small molecules and confirmed close agreement of results, though with larger deviations than in the case of semi-local TDDFT. We find that convergence of TDHF demands a finer real-space grid than semi-local TDDFT. We also present the subtleties in benchmarking a real-space calculation against GTOs, relating to Rydberg and vacuum states.</description>

      <title>Reference CC3 Excitation Energies for Organic Chromophores: Benchmarking TD-DFT, BSE/$GW$ and Wave Function Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To expand the QUEST database of highly-accurate vertical transition energies, we consider a series of large organic chromogens ubiquitous in dye chemistry, such as anthraquinone, azobenzene, BODIPY, and naphthalimide. We compute, at the CC3 level of theory, the singlet and triplet vertical transition energies associated with the low-lying excited states. This leads to a collection of more than 120 new highly-accurate excitation energies. Subsequently, we employ these reference values to benchmark a series of lower-order wave function approaches, including the popular ADC(2) and CC2 schemes, as well as time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT), both with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA). At the TD-DFT level, we evaluate a large panel of global, range-separated, local, and double hybrid functionals. Additionally, we assess the performance of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism relying on both $G_0W_0$ and ev$GW$ quasiparticle energies evaluated from various starting points. It turns out that CC2 and ADC(2.5) are the most accurate models amongst those with respective $\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ scalings with system size. In contrast, CCSD does not outperform CC2. The best performing exchange-correlation functionals include BMK, M06-2X, M06-SX, CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$B97X-D, and LH20t, with average deviations of approximately 0.20 eV or slightly below. Errors on vertical excitation energies can be further reduced by considering double hybrids. Both SOS-$\omega$B88PP86 and SOS-$\omega$PBEPP86 exhibit particularly attractive performances with overall quality on par with CC2, whereas PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH are only slightly less efficient. BSE/ev$GW$ calculations based on Kohn-Sham starting points have been found to be particularly effective for singlet transitions, but much less for their triplet counterparts.</description>

[Nature Chemistry 14, 1098, 2022] on ambient-light-induced intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) in unbound pyridine monomers proposes the formation of a pyridine cation via intermolecular Coulombic decay following a three-body association/collision, wherein all the three pyridine molecules are in the excited state. The collision-free conditions of the free-jet expansion, an abysmally low probability of finding three independently excited pyridine molecules in the vicinity of each other, and extremely low excited state lifetimes negate the possibility of ICD in unbound pyridine monomers. An alternate mechanism, wherein the pyridine monomer cation originates from the dissociative ionization of pyridine dimers following a three-photon absorption process, based on the translational energy measurements of pyridine cation is proposed.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Kohn-Sham potential for molecular dissociation with orbital-independent functionals: a proof of principle</title>

Abstract: We model the Hartree-exchange-correlation potential of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory adopting a novel strategy inspired by the strictly-correlated-electrons limit and relying on the exact decomposition of the potential based on the exact factorization formalism. Starting with accurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an approximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact Kohn-Sham potential without resorting to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, virtual or occupied. We also test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials corresponding to the strictly-correlated-electron and the exact-exchange functionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are modified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former and increasing it in the latter.</description>

      <title>A Kaczmarz-inspired approach to accelerate the optimization of neural network wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10190</link>

Abstract: Neural network wavefunctions optimized using the variational Monte Carlo method have been shown to produce highly accurate results for the electronic structure of atoms and small molecules, but the high cost of optimizing such wavefunctions prevents their application to larger systems. We propose the Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent (SPRING) optimizer to reduce this bottleneck. SPRING combines ideas from the recently introduced minimum-step stochastic reconfiguration optimizer (MinSR) and the classical randomized Kaczmarz method for solving linear least-squares problems. We demonstrate that SPRING outperforms both MinSR and the popular Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature method (KFAC) across a number of small atoms and molecules, given that the learning rates of all methods are optimally tuned. For example, on the oxygen atom, SPRING attains chemical accuracy after forty thousand training iterations, whereas both MinSR and KFAC fail to do so even after one hundred thousand iterations.</description>

      <title>Approaching Periodic Systems in Ensemble Density Functional Theory via Finite One-Dimensional Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17742v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a generalization of ground-state Density Functional Theory (GS DFT), which is based on an exact formal theory of finite collections of a system's ground and excited states. EDFT in various forms has been shown to improve the accuracy of calculated energy level differences in isolated model systems, atoms, and molecules, but it is not yet clear how EDFT could be used to calculate band gaps for periodic systems. We extend the application of EDFT toward periodic systems by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly large finite one-dimensional ``particle in a box'' systems, which approach the uniform electron gas (UEG). Using ensemble-generalized Hartree and Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) exchange-correlation functionals, we find that corrections go to zero in the infinite limit, as expected for a metallic system. However, there is a correction to the effective mass, with results comparable to other calculations on 1D, 2D, and 3D UEGs, which indicates promise for non-trivial results from EDFT on periodic systems.</description>
