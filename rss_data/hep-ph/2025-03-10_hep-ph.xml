      <title>The effect of spacetime torsion on neutrino mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of quantum field theory, we analyze the neutrino oscillations in the presence of a torsion background. We consider the Einstein Cartan theory and we study the cases of constant torsion and of linearly time-dependent torsion. We derive new neutrino oscillation formulae which depend on the spin orientation and the CP asymmetry formula. Experiment such as PTOLEMY which analyzes the cosmological background of neutrino, can provide insights into the effect shown here.</description>

      <title>New bound on the vectorial axion-down-strange coupling from $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar \nu$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze publicly available $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ data collected by NA62 from 2016 to 2022 to constrain the vectorial axion-down-strange coupling or, equivalently, the Peccei-Quinn scale $f_a$ rescaled by this coupling, obtaining $|(F_V)_{23}| &gt; 1.1 \times 10^{12}$ GeV. Under the complementary assumption that axion production is dominated by weak amplitudes, we derive a model-independent bound on $f_a$, namely $f_a &gt; 1.0 \times 10^5$ GeV. We also discuss the potential of applying the same approach to $K^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0 \nu \bar{\nu}$ data, from which we estimate the bound $|(F_A)_{23}| &gt; 1.0 \times 10^8$ GeV. These constraints represent the strongest existing bounds inferred from controlled experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Metastable Cosmic Strings and Gravitational Waves from Flavour Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings (MSCSs) are among the best-fitting explanations of the 2023 pulsar timing array (PTA) signal for gravitational waves at nanohertz frequencies. We propose the novel possibility that a network of MSCSs generating this signal originates from the multi-step spontaneous breaking of a gauged flavour symmetry. As a specific example, we construct a model of $SU(2)$ flavour symmetry in the context of $SU(5)$ grand unification, where the $SU(2)$ acts exclusively on the first two generations of the matter 10-plet, such that it is ``right for leptons'' and allows for large lepton mixing. The model explains the mass hierarchies of the Standard Model fermions, and predicts the string scale of the MSCSs in a range compatible with the 2023 PTA signal. Cosmic inflation is associated with the latter step of (two-step) family symmetry breaking, and the phase transition ending inflation generates the cosmic string network.</description>

      <title>Study of deeply virtual Compton scattering at the future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the impact of future measurements of deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) with the ePIC detector at the electron-ion collider (EIC), currently under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The considered process is sensitive to generalized parton distributions (GPDs), the understanding of which is a cornerstone of the EIC physics programme. Our study marks a milestone in the preparation of DVCS measurements at EIC and provides a reference point for future analyses. In addition to presenting distributions of basic kinematic variables obtained with the latest ePIC design and simulation software, we examine the impact of future measurements on the understanding of nucleon tomography and DVCS Compton form factors, which are directly linked to GPDs. We also assess the impact of radiative corrections and background contribution arising from exclusive $\pi^0$ production.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Annihilation from Pulsating Dark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strongly self-interacting component of asymmetric dark matter can collapse and form compact objects, provided there is an efficient mechanism of energy evacuation. If the dark matter quantum number is not completely conserved but it is slightly violated due to some new physics e.g. at the Planck scale, dark matter particles can annihilate into Standard Model particles. Even tiny annihilation cross sections are sufficient to create observable luminosities. We demonstrate that these dark matter annihilations can trigger radial pulsations, causing a characteristic time modulation of the luminosities produced. We argue that in this scenario, the spectral features along with the properties of the oscillation can create a unique discovery signal for such objects in the sky.</description>

      <title>Oblique parameters at next-to-leading order within electroweak strongly-coupled scenarios: constraining heavy resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a general (non-linear) effective field theory description of the Standard Model electroweak symmetry breaking, we analyse the impact on the electroweak oblique parameters of hypothetical heavy resonance states strongly coupled to the SM particles. We present a next-to-leading order calculation of $S$ and $T$ that updates and generalizes our previous results, including P-odd operators in the Lagrangian, fermionic cuts and the current experimental bounds. We demonstrate that in any strongly-coupled underlying theory where the two Weinberg Sum Rules are satisfied, as happens in asymptotically free gauge theories, the masses of the heavy vector and axial-vector states must be heavier than 10 TeV. Lighter resonances with masses around 2-3 TeV are only possible in theoretical scenarios where the 2nd Weinberg Sum Rule is not fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Triple Higgs Production at Muon Colliders in the Higgs Triplet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of three Higgs bosons provides a unique opportunity to probe both the trilinear and quartic Higgs couplings within the Standard Model and beyond. In this study, we investigate triple Higgs production in the Higgs Triplet Model via photon fusion, $\gamma \gamma \to h^0 h^0 h^0$, allowing us to explore the contributions from singly and doubly charged Higgs bosons and their couplings to CP-even scalars. We analyze the total cross sections and kinematic distributions, comparing our results with the corresponding SM predictions. Our calculations utilize an Automated One-Loop Calculator to evaluate the numerical amplitudes for the $2 \to 3$ process. For the collider simulations, we develop a Monte Carlo phase-space integrator to predict outcomes for a future muon collider, covering a center-of-mass energy range from 2 TeV to 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Hadron Structure: Perspective and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD) -- the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model. Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with constituent-like masses. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches the role played by EHM in shaping hadron electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, exciting nucleon resonances, and moulding hadron parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Mass Matrix Rules and the Flat Pattern of Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seeking mass patterns is a key to decoding the unknown flavor puzzles in particle physics. Inspired by quark hierarchical masses, the mass matrix can universally be factorized into a family-diagonal phase matrix $K_L^q$ and a real symmetric matrix $M_N^q$ characterized by only two parameters. The factorized structure provides model-independent rules to the mass matrix. We demonstrate that the large $\delta_{CP}$ naturally arises from the degeneracy of the first two quark families in the mass hierarchy limit. As an application, the flat pattern with elements close to unity in the matrix is checked by fitting quark masses and the CKM mixing. It achieves a precise description of flavor structure with minimal parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigating hybrid mesons with $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ exotic quantum numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid mesons occupy a unique position in the hadronic spectrum, offering a valuable insight into the non-perturbative nature of the glue field. Hybrid states with exotic $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers, such as the $1^{-+}$, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$, cannot mix with conventional $q\bar{q}$ mesons, making them critical for establishing the full spectrum of hybrid mesons. In this work, we investigate the masses and the strong decays of $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ hybrid mesons, which correspond to the first orbitally excited states of the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ mesons. We develop and apply a constituent gluon model to study the mass spectra and decay modes of these exotic states. Our results suggest that experiment may searched for these $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ hybrid mesons in the mass region between 2.0 GeV and 2.4 GeV. Additionally, we identify some key decay channels which should be targeted in future experiments.</description>

      <title>A reanalysis of event shape distributions in electron-positron annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical calculations for event shape observables are often determined by using the conventional scale setting; i.e. the procedure defined by setting the renormalization scale to the center-of-mass energy $\mu_r=\sqrt{s}$ and evaluating theoretical uncertainties by varying the same scale $\mu_r$ in an arbitrary range. Both the event shape distributions and the extracted QCD coupling $\alpha_s$ are plagued by the large renormalization scale uncertainties when using the conventional scale setting. The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) provides a rigorous method to eliminate the renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities in perturbative QCD predictions. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the event shape observables by applying the PMC method together with the use of the physical $V$-scheme. The PMC scales are not simple single-valued functions, but depend with continuity on the value of the unintegrated event shape variable. This reflects the virtuality of the underlying quark and gluon subprocess and yields to a physical behavior of the scale all over the entire range of each observable. Moreover, the PMC scales in the $V$-scheme exhibits a faster increase compared to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, and a better convergence in the perturbative series can be obtained. Results obtained by the PMC method for the event shape variables, thrust ($T$), heavy jet mass ($\rho=M^2_H/s$), wide jet broadening ($B_W$), total jet broadening ($B_T$), C-parameter ($C$), are in agreement with the high precision experimental data, and for the case of the jet transition variable $Y_3$, we obtain a first improvement in the results to some extent compared with the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme.</description>

Abstract: We present a two-loop analysis of the contributions to Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion arising from the triple-gluon operator in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT). Our discussion covers all aspects of renormalization group (RG) improved perturbation theory, including matching and running within the SMEFT. This study can therefore be seen as a blueprint of the intricacies and subtleties that arise in RG improved SMEFT calculations for collider processes beyond the leading order.</description>

      <title>Production of $1^{-+}$ exotic charmonium-like states in electron-positron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of observed charmonium-like states with the exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ has prompted us to investigate the production rates of the $1^{-+}$ $D^*\bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^*\bar D_2^*(2460)$ hadronic molecules, which we refer to as $\eta_{c1}$ and $\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$, respectively, in electron-positron collisions. Assuming a hadronic molecular nature for the vector charmonium-like states $\psi(4360)$ and $\psi(4415)$, we evaluate the radiative decay widths of $\psi(4360)\to\gamma\eta_{c1}$ and $\psi(4415)\to\gamma\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$. Using these decay widths, we estimate the cross sections for producing $\eta_{c1}$ and $\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$ in electron-positron annihilations, as well as the event numbers at the planned Super $\tau$-Charm Facility. Our results suggest that the ideal energy region for observing these states is around $4.44$ and $4.50$ GeV, just above the $D^* \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^*\bar D_2^*(2460)$ thresholds, respectively.</description>

      <title>Prospects for testing Lorentz and CPT symmetry with ${\rm H}^+_2$ and ${\rm \bar{H}}^-_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a model for testing Lorentz and CPT symmetry using rovibrational transitions within the electronic ground state of the molecular hydrogen ion (H$^+_2$). The model is based on the Standard-Model Extension (SME) and incorporates minimal and nonminimal effects. Our analysis concludes that sidereal variation studies of these transitions could establish first bounds on SME proton coefficients. Additionally, the prospects for testing CPT symmetry with the molecular antihydrogen ion are discussed and compared to those of atomic antihydrogen experiments. This comparison highlights that both systems complement each other, as each is better suited to constrain specific types of CPT-violating operators.</description>

      <title>Probing $D_s^*$-meson longitudinal twist-2 LCDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we carry on an investigation of the semileptonic decays $B_s\to D_s^*\ell \bar\nu_{\ell}$. Firstly, we derive the moments of the $D_s^*$-meson longitudinal leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) based on QCD sum rules within background field theory framework. Considering the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to dimension-six, its first ten non-zero $\xi$-moments are given. Meanwhile, we construct the $D_s^*$-meson longitudinal leading-twist LCDA by using the light-cone harmonic oscillator model. Then, using those moments, we fix the model parameters $\alpha_{2;D_s^*}$ and $B_1^{2;D_s^*}$ by the least square method and apply them to calculate $B_s \to D_s^*$ transition form factors $A_1(q^2), A_2(q^2)$ and $V(q^2)$ that are derived by using the QCD light-cone sum rules. At the large recoil region, we obtain $A_1(0) =0.632_{-0.135}^{+0.228}, A_2(0) =0.706_{-0.092}^{+0.109}$ and $V(0) =0.647_{-0.069}^{+0.076}$. Those form factors are then extrapolated to the allowed whole physical $q^2$-region through the simplified series expansion. Finally, we obtain the branching fractions for the two decay channels $B_s\to D_s^*\ell\bar\nu_\ell$, $\it i.e.$ ${\cal B}(B_s^0 \to D_s^{*+}e^-\bar\nu_e)=(5.45_{-1.57}^{+2.15})\times 10^{-2}$, ${\cal B}(B_s^0 \to D_s^{*+}\mu^-\bar\nu_\mu)=(5.43_{-1.57}^{+2.14})\times 10^{-2}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-volume extrapolation is an important step for extracting physical observables from lattice calculations. However, it is a significant challenge for the system with long-range interactions. We employ symbolic regression to regress finite-volume extrapolation formula for both short-range and long-range interactions. The regressed formula still holds the exponential form with a factor $L^n$ in front of it. The power decreases with the decreasing range of the force. When the range of the force becomes sufficiently small, the power converges to $-1$, recovering the short-range formula as expected. Our work represents a significant advancement in leveraging machine learning to probe uncharted territories within particle physics.</description>

      <title>A Classical Interpretation of the Nonrelativistic Quark Potential Model: Color Charge Definition and the Meson Mass-Radius Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing quark interactions, and various quark models based on QCD have been widely used to study the properties of hadrons, including their structures and mass spectra. However, unlike Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, there is no direct classical analogy for hadronic structures.This paper presents a classical interpretation of the nonrelativistic quark potential model, providing a more intuitive and visualizable description of strong interactions through the quantitative formulation of color charge and color flux.Furthermore, we establish the relationship between meson mass and its structural radius in the nonrelativistic framework and estimate the key parameters of our model using available data from several heavy mesons. We then extend this relationship to a broader range of excited meson states, obtaining structural radii that show good agreement with the root mean square (RMS) radius or charge radius predicted by QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Pseudorapidity density distributions of charged particles and transverse momentum spectra of identified particles in pp collisions in PACIAE 4.0 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudorapidity density distributions of charged particles and the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the center-of-mass energies ranging from $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV to 13 TeV have been systematically studied using the newly released parton and cascade model PACIAE 4.0 based on PYTHIA 8.3. The available experimental data are well reproduced across all analyzed aspects. This theoretical method can be easily extended to anywhere the experimental data for pp collisions are currently unavailable. Furthermore, since pp collisions serve as the baseline for heavy-ion collisions, our results can provide a valuable resource for both experimentalists and theorists.</description>

      <title>Studying the VBF Hjj and Hjjj Higgs Boson Production in QCD and EFT Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the Higgs boson made it possible not only to study its physical properties and update its search strategies, but also to apply new theoretical constructs to explain its properties. Within the framework of the VBF Higgs boson production process in association with two, Hjj and three jets, Hjjj, we modeled its kinematic properties and calculated its production cross-sections. The calculations were carried out within two theories, QCD and EFT for both SM processes and for the MSSM and NMSSM models within the framework of the BSM physics searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the quasi-classical (WKB) approximation of the synchrotron radiation by a fermion embedded into uniformly rotating system in external magnetic field. We show that it gives an accurate approximation of the exact expression that we recently obtained at a tiny fraction of the numerical cost. Our results can be used to compute the electromagnetic radiation of the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions of ground state mesons composed of $c$ or $b$ quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The valence quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of all ground state heavy mesons that composed of $b$ or $c$ quarks, are discussed; namely, the pseudoscalar $\eta_c(1S)$, $\eta_b(1S)$ and $B_c$, together with the corresponding vector ones, $J/\psi$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $B_c^\ast$. We use a QCD-inspired constituent quark model, which has been applied with success to conventional heavy mesons, so that one advantage here is that all parameters have already been fixed by previous studies. The wave functions of the heavy mesons in the rest frame are obtained by solving the Schr\"odinger equation, then boosted to its light-front based on Susskind's Lorentz transformation. The PDFs at the hadron scale, are then obtained by integrating out the transverse momenta of the modulus square of the light-front wave function. Our study shows how the valence quark distributions differ between pseudoscalar and vector mesons, as well as among charmonia, bottomonia and bottom-charmed mesons. Comparisons with other theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDFs obtained herein are in general narrower but align well with the expected patterns. Moreover, each PDF's point-wise behavior is squeezed with respect to the scale-free parton-like PDF.</description>

      <title>Novel and Updated Bounds on Flavor-violating Z Interactions in the Lepton Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the experimental bounds on the Flavor-Violating (FV) couplings of the $Z$ boson to the charged leptons. In addition to the direct LHC searches for FV $Z$ decays to leptons, we investigate indirect bounds from flavor-conserving $Z$ decays to leptons at 1-loop, bounds from LEP searches, Electroweak Precision Observables (EWPO), $\ell_{i}\to\ell_{j}\gamma$ decays, $\ell_{i}\to3\ell_{j}$ decays, $\ell_{i}\to\ell_{j}+\text{inv.}$ decays, FV meson decays to leptons, FV $\tau$ decays to $\mu(e)$ + mesons, muon conversion in nuclei, and from muonium-antimuonium oscillations. For FV $Z$ couplings to $\tau\mu$, we find that $\tau\to\mu\gamma$ yields the strongest bounds, with a level reaching $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, followed by bounds from $\tau\to3\mu(\mu ee)$. For FV $Z$ couplings to $\tau e$, we find that the strongest bounds arise from the decay $\tau\to\mu\mu e$, reaching $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ as well, with bounds from $\tau\to3e$ also yielding strong bounds. For FV $Z$ couplings to $\mu e$, we find that the strongest bounds are obtained from the decay $\mu\to3e$, reaching $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})$, with bounds from $\mu\to e\gamma$, muon conversion, $K_{L}^{0}\rightarrow\mu e$ and $\mu\to e+\text{inv.}$ also providing strong bounds. We also study projections from future experiments, such as the FCC-ee, Belle II and the Mu2e experiment. For the $Z$ couplings to $\tau\mu$, we find that future experiments could improve the bound to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$, whereas for the $Z$ couplings to $\tau e$, we find that future experiments could improve the bound to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-8})$, and for the $Z$ couplings to $\mu e$, they could improve the bound to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the relativistic distributions of energy, longitudinal momentum, longitudinal energy flux, and longitudinal thrust inside nucleons based on the quantum phase-space formalism. Similar to recent studies on the electromagnetic current, we include the effects of the nucleon polarization and show that the latter are essential for understanding how the Breit frame distributions transform under a longitudinal Lorentz boost. We also explicitly demonstrate that, in the infinite-momentum frame, these distributions allow one to recover not only the ``good'' but also the ``bad'' components of the light-front energy-momentum tensor distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we estimate the mass spectra and decay properties of charmonium ($c \bar c$) using a non-relativistic potential model. We employ a potential model incorporating a Coulomb like term, representing one gluon exchange at short distances, and a screening term representing quark confinement at long distances. Spin-dependent corrections are also added perturbatively. Our results are compared with available experimental data and some other theoretical models. Based on this, we have made some comments on interquark potential.</description>

      <title>Hardware acceleration for next-to-leading order event generation within MadGraph5_aMC@NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the quality of experimental measurements increases, so does the need for Monte Carlo-generated simulated events - both with respect to the total amount and to their precision. In perturbative methods, this involves the evaluation of higher order corrections to the leading order (LO) scattering amplitudes, including real emissions and loop corrections. Although experimental uncertainties today are larger than those of simulations, at the High Luminosity LHC experimental precision is expected to be above the theoretical one for events generated below next-to-leading order (NLO) precision. As forecasted hardware resources will not meet CPU requirements for these simulation needs, speeding up NLO event generation is a necessity.
  In recent years, collaborators across Europe and the United States have been working on CPU vectorisation of LO event generation within the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, as well as porting it to GPUs, to major success. Recently, development has also started on vectorising NLO event generation. Due to the more complicated nature of NLO amplitudes this development faces several difficulties not accounted for in the LO development, but it shows promise. Here, we present these issues as well as the current status of our event-parallel NLO implementation.</description>

      <title>Quantum energies of solitons with different topological charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We study this energy for two-component solitons in one space dimension as a function of the soliton's topological charge. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification From Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty from machine learning analyses is critical to their use in the physical sciences. In this work we focus on uncertainty inherited from the initialization distribution of neural networks. We compute the mean $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and variance $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}^2$ of the test loss $\mathcal{L}$ for an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with neural tangent kernel (NTK) initialization in the infinite-width limit, and compare empirically to the results from finite-width networks for three example tasks: MNIST classification, CIFAR classification and calorimeter energy regression. We observe scaling laws as a function of training set size $N_\mathcal{D}$ for both $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}$, but find that the coefficient of variation $\epsilon_{\mathcal{L}} \equiv \sigma_{\mathcal{L}}/\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ becomes independent of $N_\mathcal{D}$ at both infinite and finite width for sufficiently large $N_\mathcal{D}$. This implies that the coefficient of variation of a finite-width network may be approximated by its infinite-width value, and may in principle be calculable using finite-width perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate neutrino transport is crucial for reliably modeling explosive astrophysical events like core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs). However, in these extremely neutrino-dense systems, flavor oscillations exhibit challenging nonlinear effects rooted in neutrino-neutrino forward scattering. Evidence is quickly accumulating that these collective phenomena can substantially affect explosion dynamics, neutrino signals, nucleosynthesis, and kilonova light curves. We review the progress made so far on the difficult and conceptually deep question of how to correctly include this physics in simulations of CCSNe and NSMs. Our aim is to take a broad view of where the problem stands, and so provide a critical assessment of where it is headed.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the general analytic solution space for relativistic $(1+1)$-dimensional hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid flowing along the longitudinal direction. We work out the explicit one-parameter family of interpolating flows between boost-invariant and boost-non-invariant regimes, where a direct and simple dialing of the parameter at the level of solutions is possible. We also discuss the construction of generalised rapidity distribution of entropy for such interpolating flows at the level of potentials.</description>

      <title>The history of the Arcetri Physics Institute from the 1920s to the end of the 1960s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The history of the Arcetri Institute of Physics at the University of Florence is analyzed from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s. Thanks to the arrival of Garbasso in 1913, not only did the Institute gain new premises on Arcetri hill, but also hosted brilliant young physicists such as Rita Brunetti, Enrico Fermi, Franco Rasetti in the '20s and Enrico Persico, Bruno Rossi, Gilberto Bernardini, Daria Bocciarelli, Lorenzo Emo Capodilista, Giuseppe Occhialini and Giulio Racah in the '30s, engaged in the emerging fields of Quantum Mechanics and Cosmic Rays. This internationally renowned Arcetri School dissolved in the late 1930s mainly for the transfer of its protagonists to chairs in other Italian or foreign universities. After the war, the legacy was taken up by some students of this school who formed research groups in the fields of nuclear physics and elementary particle physics. As far as theoretical physics is concerned, after the Fermi and Persico periods, these studies enjoyed a new expansion in the sixties thanks to the arrival of Raoul Gatto who created in Arcetri the first Italian school of theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Is MOND necessarily nonlinear?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass, $a\sim (M\mathcal{A}_0)^{1/2}/r$, implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot be linear in the mass distribution ($\mathcal{A}_0\equiv Ga_0$ is the DML constant, and $a_0$ the MOND acceleration). This leads to important idiosyncracies of MOND, such as a breakdown of the strong equivalence principle, and the resulting ``external-field effect''. I show that the DML axioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic, action-based, linear formulation of the DML. This model suffers from important drawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND theory. The model is unique among MOND theories propounded to date not only in being linear -- hence not exhibiting an external-field effect, for example -- but in constituting a modification of both Newtonian inertia and Newtonian gravity. This linear and time-local model inspires and begets several, one-parameter families of models. One family employs nonlinear, time-nonlocal kinetic terms, but still linear gravitational-field equations. Other families generalize the DMLs of AQUAL and QUMOND, modifying gravity as well as inertia. All families employ fractional time derivatives and possibly fractional Laplacians. At present, I cannot base some acceptable MOND theory on these models -- for example, I cannot offer a sensible umbrella theory that interpolates between these DML models and Newtonian dynamics. They are, however, quite useful in elucidating various matter-of-principle aspects of MOND; e.g., they help to understand which predictions follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- so-called primary predictions -- and which are secondary, i.e., theory dependent. The models may also show the way to a wider class of MOND theories. (Abridged.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that atomic antimatter spectroscopy can be used to search for new bosons that carry spin-dependent exotic forces between antifermions. A comparison of a recent precise measurement of the hyperfine splitting of the $1$S and $2$S electronic levels of antihydrogen and bound-state quantum electrodynamics theory yields the first tests of positron-antiproton exotic interactions, constraining the dimensionless coupling strengths $g_pg_p$, $g_Vg_V$ and $g_Ag_A$, corresponding to the exchange of a pseudoscalar (axionlike), vector, or axial-vector boson, respectively. We also discuss new tests of CPT invariance with exotic spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions involving antimatter.</description>

      <title>Exploring $\Delta$-resonance in neutron stars: implications from astrophysical and nuclear observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive Bayesian inference of neutron star matter, incorporating $\Delta$-resonances alongside hyperons and nucleons within a density-dependent relativistic hadron (DDRH) framework. Using constraints from nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), NICER radius measurements, and tidal deformability data from GW170817, we systematically explore the impact of $\Delta$-resonances on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter and neutron star observables. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Delta$-baryons softens the EoS at low densities while maintaining sufficient stiffness at high densities to support $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars. This naturally reconciles neutron star radius constraints with the recent observation of the low-mass compact object in HESS J1731-347 while simultaneously exhibiting excellent agreement with GW170817 tidal deformability constraints, reinforcing the astrophysical viability of $\Delta$-admixed neutron stars. Additionally, $\Delta$-resonances are found to populate the outer layers of the neutron star core, which may have implications for neutron star mergers and their cooling. Furthermore, we show that the presence of $\Delta$-baryons might significantly influence neutron star cooling via the direct Urca process. We also investigate quasi-normal $f$-mode oscillations within a fully general relativistic framework, revealing strong correlations between the $f$-mode frequency, neutron star compactness, and tidal deformability. With the inclusion of $\Delta$-resonances and adherence to astrophysical constraints, we obtain $f_{1.4} = 1.97^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$ kHz and the damping time $\tau_{f_{1.4}} = 0.19^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$ s at the $1\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression as a Sustainable Data-driven Background Estimate Method at the (HL)-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we evaluate the performance of a data-driven background estimate method based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). A realistic background spectrum from a search conducted by CMS is considered, where a large sub-region below the trigger threshold is included. It is found that the $L_2$ regularisation can serve as a set of hyperparameters and control the overall modelling performance to satisfy common standards established by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition, we show the robustness of this method against increasing luminosity via pseudo-experiments matching the expected luminosity at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). While traditional methods relying on empirical functions have been challenged during LHC Run 2 already, a GPR-based technique can offer a solution that is valid through the entire lifetime of the (HL)-LHC.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Running Coupling for Heavy Quarks in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work [arXiv:2407.11924], which investigated the influence of a magnetic field on the running coupling constant in a bottom-up holographic light-quark model, to the case of a heavy-quark model. To achieve this, we employ a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton background that captures the essential features of heavy quark dynamics. Similar to the light-quark model, the running coupling $\alpha$ for heavy quarks decreases in the presence of a strong external magnetic field at fixed temperature and chemical potential. The key distinction between the light and heavy quark models lies in the locations of their respective phase transitions. However, near the 1st order phase transitions, the behavior of $\alpha$ is analogous for both cases: $\alpha$ exhibits jumps that depend on temperature, chemical potential, and magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Predicted Neutrino Signal Features of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the neutrino signals from 24 initially non-rotating, three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations carried to late times. We find that not only does the neutrino luminosity signal encode information about each stage of the CCSN process, but that the monotonic dependence of the luminosity peak height with compactness enables one to infer the progenitor core structure from the neutrino signal. We highlight a systematic relationship between the luminosity peak height with its timing. Additionally, we emphasize that the total energy radiated in neutrinos is monotonic with progenitor compactness, and that the mean neutrino energy contains a unique spiral SASI signature for nonexploding, BH-forming models. We also find that neutrino emissions are not isotropic and that the anisotropy increases roughly with progenitor compactness. To assess the detectability of these neutrino signal features, we provide examples of the event rates for our models for the JUNO, DUNE, SK, and IceCube detectors using the SNEWPY software, and find that many of the trends in the luminosity signal can be detectable across several detectors and oscillation models. Finally, we discuss correlations between the radiated neutrino energy and the evolution of the gravitational-wave f-mode.</description>

      <title>Measuring the polarization of boosted, hadronic $W$ bosons with jet substructure observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.04318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new technique to measure the longitudinal and transverse polarization fractions of hadronic decays of boosted $W$ bosons. We introduce a new jet substructure observable denoted as $p_\theta$, which is a proxy constructed purely out of subjet energies for the parton level decay polar angle of the $W$ boson in its rest-frame. The distribution of this observable is sensitive to the polarization of $W$ bosons and can therefore be used to reconstruct the $W$ polarization in a way that is independent of the production process -- assuming Standard Model (SM) rules governing decays. We argue that this proxy variable has lower reconstruction errors as compared to the other proxies that have been used by the experimental collaborations, especially for large boosts of the $W$-boson. As a test case, we study the efficacy of our technique on vector boson scattering (VBS) processes at the high luminosity Large Hadron Collider. We find that with only SM production channels, measuring the longitudinal polarization fraction is likely to be challenging even with 10 ab$^{-1}$ of data. We suggest further strategies and scenarios that may improve the prospects of measurement of the hadronic $W$ polarization fraction.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of a polarized neutron by internal weak nuclear forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proven that a polarized neutron gets accelerated by internal nuclear forces along the coherent rotation of its spin. A net internal force upon the neutron arises from the chiral weak interactions between its quarks, which results from the simultaneous breaking of parity and time-reversal symmetries by the weak nuclear interaction and the spin polarization of the neutron, respectively. The variation of the neutron's kinetic momentum is accompanied with the transfer of an equivalent linear momentum to the fields of the Z and W-bosons that mediate the interactions, in the opposite direction. The effect is linear in Fermi's constant. Using the simplest hadron models, an upper bound of the order of meters per second is estimated for the velocity variation of the polarized neutron along the spin-flip process.</description>

      <title>QCD Running in Lepton Number Violating Meson and Tau Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Below the electroweak scale, new physics that violates lepton number in two units ($\Delta L = 2$) and is mediated by heavy particle exchange can be parameterized by a dimension-9 low-energy effective Lagrangian. Operators in this Lagrangian involving first-generation quarks and leptons contribute to the short-range mechanism of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and therefore they are strongly constrained. On the other hand, operators with other quark and lepton families are bounded by the non-observation of different lepton number violating (LNV) meson and tau decays, such as $M_1^- \to M_2^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^-$ and $\tau^- \to \ell^+ M_1^- M_2^-$. In this work, we calculate RGE-improved bounds on the Wilson coefficients involved in these decays. We calculate QCD corrections to the dimension-9 operator basis and find RG evolution matrices that describe the evolution of the Wilson coefficients across different energy scales. Unlike the running of operators involved in $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay, the general flavor structure leads to the mixing of not only different Lorentz structures but also of different quark-flavor configurations. Additionally, operators that vanish for the identical lepton case need to be added to the operator basis. We find new constraints on previously unbounded operators and the enhancement of bounds for specific Wilson coefficients. We also find new bounds coming from the mixing between operators with different quark-flavor configurations.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Maximum Conformality Correctly Resolves the Renormalization-Scheme-Dependence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify a serious misinterpretation and consequent misuse of the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), which also can be served as a mini review of PMC. We emphasize that the purpose of the PMC is to achieve precise fixed-order pQCD predictions, free from conventional renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities. We demonstrate that the PMC predictions satisfy all of the self-consistency conditions of the renormalization group and standard renormalization-group invariance; the PMC predictions are thus independent of any initial choice of renormalization scheme and scale. The scheme independence of the PMC is also ensured by commensurate scale relations which relate different observables to each other. Moreover, in the Abelian limit, the PMC dovetails into the well-known Gell-Mann--Low framework, a method universally revered for its precision in QED calculations. Due to the elimination of factorially-divergent renormalon terms, the PMC series not only attains a convergence behavior far superior to that of its conventional counterparts but also deftly curtails any residual scale dependence caused by the unknown higher-order terms. This refined convergence, coupled with its robust suppression of residual uncertainties, furnishes a sound and reliable foundation for estimating the contributions from unknown higher-order terms. Anchored in the bedrock of standard renormalization group invariance, the PMC simultaneously eradicates the factorial divergences and eliminates superfluous systematic errors, which inversely provides a good foundation for achieving high-precision pQCD predictions. Consequently, owing to its rigorous theoretical underpinnings, the PMC is eminently applicable to virtually all high-energy hadronic processes.</description>

      <title>Differential torsion sensor for direct detection of ultralight vector dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons with masses in the range from $\sim 10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ to $\sim 1$ eV/$c^2$, are well-motivated, wave-like dark matter candidates. Particles on the lower-mass end are less explored in experiments due to their vanishingly small mass and weak coupling to the Standard Model. We propose a sensor with dual torsion pendulums for the direct detection of U(1)$_{B\!-\!L}$ gauge boson dark matter, which can achieve an enhanced differential torque sensitivity in a frequency band of $\sim 10^{-2}$-$10$ Hz due to its advantages in common-mode rejection and differential angular sensitivity. We describe the design of the differential torsion sensor and present the estimated sensitivity to an ultralight dark matter field coupled to baryon minus lepton ($B\!-\!L$) number, in a mass range of $\sim 10^{-17}$-$10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. Given a setup with meter-scale torsion pendulum beams and kg-scale test masses, the projected constraints on the coupling constant $g_{B\!-\!L}$ can reach $\sim 10^{-27}$ for a boson mass of $\sim 10^{-15}$ eV/$c^2$.</description>

Abstract: There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$, particularly whether they are near-threshold resonances, virtual states or bound states. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be used to unambiguously distinguish between these three scenarios. More concretely, we show that the low-momentum $D^0D^{*-}$/$D^0D_s^{*-}$ correlation functions significantly differ in the three scenarios. The high-momentum results exhibit distinct characteristics in the resonant and virtual state scenarios, especially in small collision systems of 1 fm, as produced in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. We hope all these discoveries can stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states discovered.</description>

Abstract: We present novel and comprehensive numerical predictions of CP violation in antitriplet charmed baryon decays, which are the first of their kind. Adopting the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry and the final state re-scattering framework, we relate the CKM-suppressed amplitudes to the leading ones, which are proportional to $\lambda_b$ and $\lambda_d$, respectively, with $\lambda_q = V_{uq}V^*_{cq}$. Larger-than-expected CP violations are found, reaching the order of $10^{-3}$, similar in magnitude to those in $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^- ,K^+K^-$. This makes it promising to observe CP violation for the first time in baryon decays and provides valuable tests for the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole probes of heavy neutral leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH), while still constituting a viable dark matter component, are expected to evaporate through Hawking radiation. Assuming the semi-classical approximation holds up to near the Planck scale, PBHs are expected to evaporate by the present time, emitting a significant flux of particles in their final moments, if produced in the early Universe with an initial mass of $\sim 10^{15}$ g. These ``exploding'' black holes will release a burst of Standard Model particles alongside any additional degrees of freedom, should they exist. We explore the possibility that heavy neutral leptons (HNL), mixing with active neutrinos, are emitted in the final evaporation stages. We perform a multimessenger analysis. We calculate the expected number of active neutrinos from such an event, including contributions due to the HNL decay for different assumptions on the mixings, that could be visible in IceCube. We also estimate the number of gamma-ray events expected at HAWC. By combining the two signals, we infer sensitivities on the active-sterile neutrino mixing and on the sterile neutrino mass. We find that, for instance, for the scenario where $U_{\tau 4}\neq 0$, IceCube and HAWC could improve current constraints by a few orders of magnitude, for HNLs masses between 0.1 - 1 GeV, and a PBH explosion occurring at a distance of $\sim 10^{-4}$ pc from Earth.</description>

      <title>Beam energy dependence of transverse momentum distribution and elliptic flow in Au-Au collisions using HYDJET++ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the particle ratios, transverse momentum spectra, and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of $\pi^\pm,k^\pm,$ $p$, and $\bar{p}$ in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 62.4, 39.0, 27.0, 19.6 and 11.5 GeV using HYDJET++ model. The particle ratios match the experimental data that validates the Cleymans-Reidlich parameterization of freeze-out parameters at lower beam energies under the HYDJET++ framework. The lower collision energies produce a system of high baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) and have a lower inelastic cross section. The interplay between these effects affects the overall shape of the $p_T$ spectra. The HYDJET++ model calculations for $p_T$ spectra agree well with the available experimental data. The invariant yield ratio of central and peripheral collisions is independent of beam energy. The elliptic flow is calculated based on the scaling between initial and final azimuthal spatial anisotropy ($k$). This interpretation of $v_2$ successfully describes the experimental data for all the collision energies studied in this work. The positive correlation of $k$ with beam energy leads to a small $v_2$ at lower collision energies. The hadrons containing strange quarks tend to have smaller values of $k$ than the non-strange hadrons.</description>

      <title>Folded Context Condensation in Path Integral Formalism for Infinite Context Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a Heavy Neutral Lepton at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04340v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy lepton singlets $N$ slightly mixed with a standard neutrino $\nu_\ell$ are usually searched for at the LHC in the trilepton plus $p_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ channel: $pp \to W^+ \to \ell^+ N$ with $N\to \ell^- W^+ \to \ell^- \ell'^+ \nu$. We show that, although the longitudinal momentum of the final $\nu$ escapes detection, the mass of the heavy lepton can be reconstructed. While this possibility has not been considered in recent LHC searches, we find that the search for a mass peak could systematically improve the current collider bounds on the mixing $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ for any mass $m_N\ge M_W$.</description>

      <title>Approximate magic symmetry in a cobimaximal scenario of Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The searches for an underlying pattern in neutrino masses have motivated different proposals for textures in the neutrino mass matrix, which is also related to particular arranges of the mixing matrix. Current experimental determinations of neutrino mixings have restricted some of the most studied proposals. In this work, we propose a new combined constraint on the neutrino mass matrix arising from the cobimaximal mixing and the magic symmetry in a model-independent fashion. We show that both conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously in an exact but rather in an approximate way. We have found that the Majorana CP phases are tightly restricted within this approach, leading to well-defined regions in the neutrinoless double beta decay amplitude. The small symmetry breaking requirement favors the combinations of Majorana phases $(|\beta_1|,|\beta_2|)\approx(1.53,1.54)$ and $(3.18,1.58)$, for normal and inverted ordering, respectively, which lead to $m_{\beta\beta} \approx 0.02 ~eV$, consistent with current bounds on the mixing angles, neutrinoless doble-beta decay, and cosmology results.</description>

      <title>Explaining Snowball-in-hell Phenomena in Heavy-ion Collisions Using a Novel Thermodynamic Variable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A loosely bound hadronic molecule produced by a relativistic heavy-ion collision has been described as a ``snowball in hell'' since it emerges from a hadron resonance gas whose temperature is orders of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the molecule. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of a novel thermodynamic variable called the ``contact'' that is conjugate to the binding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be expressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the hadron resonance gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.</description>

      <title>New Physics at Tera-$Z$: Precision Renormalised</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the power of a Tera-$Z$ run at FCC-ee for indirectly detecting or constraining heavy new physics. Our main finding is that nearly every new particle which matches at tree level to dimension-six operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) affects electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) at either tree level or via one loop renormalisation group (RG) running. This is true almost regardless of the structure of couplings to the Standard Model; just a handful of exceptions are identified which can produce zeroes in the EWPO RG equations. Under simple flavour assumptions, we perform fits of each state to projected FCC-ee $Z$ pole measurements, showing that all scenarios can be tested at the TeV scale or better, with many projected exclusions reaching tens of TeV. Tera-$Z$ is argued to provide an almost inescapable probe of heavy new physics.</description>

      <title>Collisional corrections to spin polarization from quantum kinetic theory using Chapman-Enskog expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the collisional corrections to the spin polarization pseudo-vector, $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$, using quantum kinetic theory in Chapman-Enskog expansion. We derive the spin Boltzmann equation incorporating M{\o}ller scattering process. We further consider two distinct scenarios using hard thermal loop approximations for simplification. In scenario (I), the vector charge distribution function is treated as off-equilibrium under the validity domain of gradient expansion. Remarkably, the polarization induced by gradients of thermal chemical potential and shear viscous tensors are modified, but $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario does not depend on the coupling constant. In scenario (II), the vector charge distribution function is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Then collisional corrections $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario are at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^{2}\partial^{2})$. Additionally, we evaluate the $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$ using relaxation time approach for comparative analysis. Our results establish the theoretical framework necessary for the future numerical investigations on the interaction corrections to spin polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomical and cosmological observations indicate that dark matter should interact very weakly with the electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, the existence of such interactions is not precluded by observations nor by theoretical considerations. A promising approach to probe the dark matter electromagnetic properties is through the search of photon-mediated dark matter-nucleus interactions in direct detection experiments. In this paper we present a simple methodology to calculate the scattering rate in a direct detection experiment for given values of the dark matter electric charge, charge radius, electric- and magnetic- dipole moments and anapole moment. In our work we include contributions to the scattering from nuclear recoils and from the Migdal effect. We finally apply this formalism to determine exclusion limits on the five electromagnetic interactions using data from XENON1T, LZ, PICO-60 and DS50 experiments, and we discuss the implications for a simplified dark matter model with t-channel mediators.</description>

      <title>Twin electroweak bubble nucleation and gravitational wave under the $S_3$ symmetry of two-Higgs-doublet model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02499v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sphaleron electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is calculated in two phase transition stages, thereby showing that the twin (or double) bubble nucleation structure of the phase transition and gravitational wave is in the investigation area of future detectors. With $v^2=v^2_1+v^2_2$ ($v_1$ and $v_2$ are two vacuum average values (VEV)), the parameter $\tan\beta=v_2/v_1$, is the ratio between two VEVs although it does not affect the strength of EWPT but affect the sphaleron energy. However, it only causes this energy to increase slightly. As $a=v^2/v_2^2$ increases, the maximum difference of sphaleron energy in one stage is about $6.15$ TeV. $a$ affects the expansion of bubbles during two phase transitions. The more $a$ increases, the more the expansion of two bubbles is at the same time. This ratio does not greatly affect the sphaleron energy but has an impact on gravitational waves. The larger the masses of the charged Higgs particles are, the greater the gravitational wave energy density ($\Omega h^2$) is. When the frequency is in the range $0-1.2$ mHz, $\Omega h^2$ will has a maximum value in the range $10^{-12}-10^{-11}$ for all values of $a$ so this can be detected in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum maximum entropy closure for small flavor coherence</title>

Abstract: Quantum angular moment transport schemes are an important avenue toward describing neutrino flavor mixing phenomena in dense astrophysical environments such as supernovae and merging neutron stars. Successful implementation will require new closure relations that go beyond those used in classical transport. In this paper, we derive the first analytic expression for a quantum M1 closure, valid in the limit of small flavor coherence, based on the maximum entropy principle. We verify that the resulting closure relation has the appropriate limits and characteristic speeds in the diffusive and free-streaming regimes. We then use this new closure in a moment linear stability analysis to search for fast flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger simulation and find better results as compared with previously designed, ad hoc, semiclassical closures.</description>

      <title>Probing dimension-8 SMEFT operators through neutral meson mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of effective interactions of dimension-8 (dim-8) operators in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) on neutral meson mixing, focusing on the $K^0-\bar K^0$, $B_{d,s}-\bar B_{d,s}$, and $D^0-\bar D^0$ systems. Within the framework of the low energy effective field theory (LEFT), each system is governed by eight dim-6 operators, with four originating at tree level from dim-6 SMEFT operators and the other four from dim-8 SMEFT operators. Notably, in certain UV complete models those dim-8 operators instead of the dim-6 ones are generated at the leading order. Our analysis focuses on those dim-8 operators and includes their one-loop QCD renormalization group running effects. By leveraging the LEFT master formula we impose stringent constraints on the effective scales associated with these dim-8 operators. We find that neutral meson mixing can probe an effective scale up to 80 TeV for some operators, surpassing the constraints imposed on other dim-8 operators by other observables. Lastly, we present a UV complete model capable of generating dim-8 operators at the leading order, thus offering a unique perspective on the interplay between different operator dimensions in probing new physics phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a simple theory for physics beyond the Standard Model where a Majorana dark matter is predicted from anomaly cancellation. We discuss in detail the minimal theory where the baryon number is a local symmetry spontaneously broken at the low scale. The correlation between the cosmological constraints on the dark matter relic density, the direct detection and collider bounds is investigated. We discuss in great detail the gamma lines from dark matter annihilation showing the possibility to test these predictions in the near future at gamma-ray telescopes such as CTA. We investigate all processes contributing to the total photon flux from dark matter annihilation and point out the unique features that can be used to test this theory for dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generation of the baryon asymmetry in Composite Higgs models with partial compositeness of the Standard Model (SM) fermions and heavy right-handed neutrinos, developing for the first time a complete picture of leptogenesis in that setup. The asymmetry is induced by the out of equilibrium decays of the heavy right-handed neutrinos into a plasma of the nearly conformal field theory (CFT), i.e. the deconfined phase of the Composite Higgs dynamics. This exotic mechanism, which we call Conformal Leptogenesis, admits a reliable description in terms of a set of ``Boltzmann equations'' whose coefficients can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of the CFT. The asymmetry thus generated is subsequently affected by the supercooling resulting from the confining phase transition of the strong Higgs sector as well as by the washout induced by the resonances formed after the transition. Nevertheless, a qualitative description of the latter effects suggests that conformal leptogenesis can successfully reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry in a wide region of parameter space. A distinctive signature of our scenarios is a sizable compositeness for all the generations of SM neutrinos, which is currently consistent with all constraints but may be within reach of future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the Newman-Penrose formalism of Maxwell's equations using two approaches: differential forms and intrinsic derivatives. Denoting $(k_{AF})^\mu$ as $k^\mu$, with $k^\mu=(k^t,k^r,0,0)$ in spherically symmetric spacetimes, we show that the expansion in $r^{-1}$ fails to produce consistent, closed solutions due to the inability to separate Lorentz-violating (LV) phase factors, as the Lorentz-invariant (LI) null tetrad does not adapt to the LV wavefront. Moreover, with exact formal solutions, we demonstrate that the expansion is nonperturbative in the LV parameter $k^2\equiv k^t-k^r$. For $r\gg1/k^2$, higher powers of $k^2$ dominate over lower powers, as the latter decay more rapidly with increasing $r$. Although the Coulomb mode $\phi_1\sim\mathcal{O}(\ln{r}/r^2)$ deviates from the LI expectation $\mathcal{O}(r^{-2})$ due to LV corrections, the leading outgoing radiation mode remains unaffected, i.e., $\phi_2\sim\mathcal{O}(r^{-1})$. Given the constraint $|k_{AF}|\le10^{-44}$GeV \cite{CMBLV-N}, the three complex scalars $\phi_a$ ($a=0,1,2$) still obey the peeling theorem: $\phi_a\sim\mathcal{O}(r^{(a-3)}),~a=0,1,2$ for large, finite distances.</description>

      <title>Charged Lepton Flavour Violating Meson Decays in Seesaw Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of neutrino oscillations demands the existence of flavour violation in charged lepton sector. The relation between the branching ratios of different charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) decay modes depends on the details of the neutrino mass model. In this work, we consider the three types of simple seesaw mechanisms of neutrino masses and study the correlation between the radiative CLFV decays and the meson CLFV decays. We find that the meson CLFV decay branching ratios are negligibly small in type-II seesaw mechanism whereas they are constrained to be at least three (two) orders of magnitude smaller than the radiative CLFV decay branching ratios in the case of type-I (type-III) seesaw mechanism. Thus the relationship between these two modes of CLFV decays helps in distinguishing between different types of seesaw mechanism. If, the branching ratios of CLFV decays of mesons are larger than those of radiative CLFV decays, it provides a strong hint that the neutrino mass generating mechanism is more complicated than simple seesaw.</description>

Abstract: The possible existence of nucleon-antinucleon bound states has been studied for decades. We investigate the $e^+e^-\to p\bar{p}$ and $e^+e^-\to n\bar{n}$ cross sections in the nonrelativistic effective field theory framework. The proton-antiproton and neutron-antineutron coupled-channel final state interactions are considered and found responsible for near-threshold enhancements. Both the proton-neutron mass difference and the Coulomb interaction between $p$ and $\bar{p}$ are considered, and the $N\bar{N}$ strong interactions are taken into account through a short-distance optical potential. By fitting the low energy constants in the amplitudes to the data for the near-threshold $e^+e^-\to N\bar{N}$ cross sections from the BESIII and SND Collaborations, a $N\bar{N}$ quasi-bound state is found just above the $p\bar{p}$ threshold, and another $N\bar{N}$ pole is found on the unphysical Riemann sheet, farther away from the threshold. The constructed coupled-channel amplitude with Coulomb effects also offers a framework that can be used directly in experimental analyses on fine structures near the $N\bar{N}$ thresholds.</description>

      <title>Flavor Patterns of Fundamental Particles from Quantum Entanglement?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which controls flavor mixing between the three generations of quark fermions, is a key input to the Standard Model of particle physics. In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of $2 \to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.</description>

      <title>New physics decaying into metastable particles: impact on cosmic neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate decays of hypothetical unstable new physics particles into metastable species such as muons, pions, or kaons in the Early Universe, when temperatures are in the MeV range, and study how they affect cosmic neutrinos. We demonstrate that the non-trivial dynamics of metastables in the plasma alters the impact of the new physics particles on the neutrino population, including the effective number of neutrino degrees of freedom, $N_{\rm eff}$, modifies neutrino spectral distortions, and may induce asymmetries in neutrino and antineutrino energy distributions. These modifications have important implications for observables such as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background, especially in light of upcoming CMB observations aiming to reach percent-level precision on $N_{\rm eff}$. We illustrate our findings with a few examples of new physics particles and provide a computational tool available for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of metastable Standard Model particles from long-lived particle decays in the MeV primordial plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological impact of hypothetical unstable new physics particles that decay in the MeV-scale plasma of the Early Universe. Focusing on scenarios where the decays produce metastable species such as muons, pions, and kaons, we systematically analyze the dynamics of these particles using coupled Boltzmann equations governing their abundances. Our results demonstrate that the metastable species can efficiently annihilate or interact with nucleons, often leading to their disappearance before decay. The suppression of decay significantly alters the properties of cosmic neutrinos, impacting cosmological observables like Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background. To support further studies, we provide two public codes: the Mathematica code that traces the evolution of these metastable particles, as well as the python-based unintegrated neutrino Boltzmann solver that uses this evolution as an input and may be applied to a broad range of scenarios. We then utilize them for studying a few particular new physics models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous challenges persist in High Energy Physics (HEP), the addressing of which requires advancements in detection technology, computational methods, data analysis frameworks, and phenomenological designs. We provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent progress across these areas, in line with advances in quantum technology. We will discuss the potential of quantum devices in detecting subtle effects indicative of new physics beyond the Standard Model, the transformative role of quantum algorithms and large-scale quantum computers in studying real-time non-perturbative dynamics in the early universe and at colliders, as well as in analyzing complex HEP data. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of integrating quantum properties into HEP experiments to test quantum mechanics at unprecedented high-energy scales and search for hints of new physics. Looking ahead, the continued integration of resources to fully harness these evolving technologies will enhance our efforts to deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <title>Nucleon relativistic weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic full weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions inside a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron are systematically studied for the first time, where the second-class current contribution associated with the induced pseudotensor form factor (FF) is included. We clearly demonstrate that the 3D axial charge distribution, being parity-odd in the Breit frame, is in fact related to the induced pseudotensor FF $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than the axial FF $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving hadron, and compare them with their light-front counterparts. We revisit the role played by the Melosh rotation, and understand more easily and intuitively the origins of distortions appearing in light-front distributions (relative to the Breit frame ones) using the conjecture that we propose in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii. We finally illustrate our results in the case of a proton using the weak-neutral axial-vector FFs extracted from experimental data.</description>

Abstract: We compute the fragmentation function of a light quark into S-wave fully-charmed tetraquarks ($T_{4c}$) within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework, at leading order in $\alpha_{s}$ and $v$. We present results for light quark fragmentation into $T_{4c}$ and predict its contribution to $T_{4c}$ production at high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) at the LHC and EIC. We also compare light quark fragmentation with charm quark and gluon fragmentation channels. Our analysis shows that the production cross section for $T_{4c}$ from light quark fragmentation is smaller than that from gluon fragmentation but larger than that from charm quark fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Invisible: ALPs and Sterile Neutrinos at the LHC and HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of using the signature of mono-Higgs plus large missing energies to constrain on two new physics models, namely the model of an axion-like particle (ALP) and the model of sterile neutrinos. We focus on the Higgs-ALP interactions starting at dimension-six and the Higgs-sterile neutrino interactions starting at dimension-five, via the processes $pp \to h a a$ for ALP production and $pp \to h N N$ for sterile neutrinos at the LHC and High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), followed by the Higgs decay $h \to b \bar{b}$. We establish bounds on the ALP-Higgs coupling $\frac{C_{aH}}{\Lambda^2}$ and sterile neutrino-Higgs coupling $\frac{\lambda_3}{M_*}$, respectively, for ALP and sterile-neutrino mass ranging from 1 to 60 GeV, using the recent ATLAS data on mono-Higgs plus missing energies at the LHC $(\sqrt{s} = 13\;{\rm TeV}\; {\rm and}\; \mathcal{L} = 139\; {\rm fb}^{-1})$. The most stringent constraint occurs in the missing transverse energy $M_{ET}$ range $200 &lt; M_{ET} \leq 350$ GeV. We also estimate the sensitivities that we can achieve at the HL-LHC ($\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV and $\mathcal{L} = 3000$ fb$^{-1}$). We obtain improved sensitivities across various missing energy regions. The ALP model exhibits better sensitivities, particularly at lower mass range, compared to the sterile neutrino model, which shows weaker sensitivities across similar mass and energy ranges. Our results underscore the potential of the mono-Higgs signature as a robust probe for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A Step Toward Interpretability: Smearing the Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of interpretability of machine learning architecture in particle physics has no agreed-upon definition, much less any proposed solution. We present a first modest step toward these goals by proposing a definition and corresponding practical method for isolation and identification of relevant physical energy scales exploited by the machine. This is accomplished by smearing or averaging over all input events that lie within a prescribed metric energy distance of one another and correspondingly renders any quantity measured on a finite, discrete dataset continuous over the dataspace. Within this approach, we are able to explicitly demonstrate that (approximate) scaling laws are a consequence of extreme value theory applied to analysis of the distribution of the irreducible minimal distance over which a machine must extrapolate given a finite dataset. As an example, we study quark versus gluon jet identification, construct the smeared likelihood, and show that discrimination power steadily increases as resolution decreases, indicating that the true likelihood for the problem is sensitive to emissions at all scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the new physics sensitivity of the rare decay $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \nu\bar\nu$ which can be accessible at future $Z$-pole machines like FCC-ee and CEPC. We find that the longitudinal polarization of $\Lambda_b$ baryons produced in $Z$ decays introduces a novel observable, the forward-backward asymmetry $A_\text{FB}^\uparrow$ in the angle between the outgoing $\Lambda$ momentum and the $\Lambda_b$ spin. We provide Standard Model predictions for the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \nu\bar\nu$ branching ratio and $A_\text{FB}^\uparrow$, and show that future precision measurements of these observables are complementary and probe new physics scales comparable to other $b \to s \nu\bar\nu$ and $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ processes. We also show that the zero crossing of the forward-backward asymmetry offers a robust test of form factor calculations independent of new physics.</description>

Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis and Decay Mechanisms of $1^{-+}$ Hybrid States in Light Meson Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of exotic mesons, which transcend the conventional quark-antiquark framework, is pivotal for advancing our understanding of QCD and the strong interaction. Among these, states possessing the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$, such as $\pi_1(1600)$, $\pi_1(2015)$, and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$, have attracted significant attention due to their potential hybrid nature, which involves gluonic excitations. However, the physical interpretation of these states remains contentious, primarily due to inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. To address these challenges, we employ a potential model inspired by SU$(3)$ lattice gauge theory to calculate the masses of light-flavor $1^{-+}$ hybrid states and utilize the constituent gluon model to analyze their strong decay properties. Our mass calculations suggest that while the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ masses are in close agreement with the predicted hybrid states, the corresponding decay widths for $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\pi_1(2015)$ do not support their classification as hybrids, implying alternative interpretations, such as tetraquark or molecular configurations. Conversely, the $\eta_1(1855)$ is consistent with a mixed hybrid state composed of $(u\bar{u}+d\bar{d})g/\sqrt{2}$ and $s\bar{s}g$ components, with mixing angles ranging from $-7.4^\circ$ to $1.37^\circ$. Additionally, we predict the masses and decay widths of yet-unobserved isoscalar and excited hybrid states, providing valuable targets for future experimental searches. This study not only clarifies the hybrid nature of certain exotic mesons but also contributes to the systematic classification of hybrid states within the meson nonet, thereby enhancing our comprehension of exotic hadronic states.</description>

      <title>Analytic Four-Point Lightlike Form Factors and OPE of Null-Wrapped Polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain for the first time the analytic two-loop four-point MHV lightlike form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar ${\cal N}=4$ SYM where the momentum $q$ carried by the operator is taken to be massless. Remarkably, we find that the two-loop result can be constrained uniquely by the infrared divergences and the collinear limits using the master-bootstrap method. Moreover, the remainder function depends only on three dual conformal invariant variables, which can be understood from a hidden dual conformal symmetry of the form factor arising in the lightlike limit of $q$. The symbol alphabet of the remainder contains only nine letters, which are closed under the action of the dihedral group $D_4$. Based on the dual description in terms of periodic Wilson lines (null-wrapped polygons), we also consider a new OPE picture for the lightlike form factors and introduce a new form factor transition that corresponds to the three-point lightlike form factor. With the form factor results up to two loops, we make some all-loop predictions using the OPE picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram's complexities, including quark deconfinement transitions, liquid-gas phase changes, and critical points, using the chiral mean-field (CMF) model that is able to capture all these features. We introduce a vector meson renormalization within the CMF framework, enabling precise adjustments of meson masses and coupling strengths related to vector meson interactions. Performing a new fit to the deconfinement potential, we are able to replicate recent lattice QCD results, low energy nuclear physics properties, neutron star observational data, and key phase diagram features as per modern constraints. This approach enhances our understanding of vector mesons' roles in mediating nuclear interactions and their impact on the equation of state, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the QCD phase diagram and its implications for nuclear and astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Upcoming searches for decaying dark matter with ULTRASAT ultraviolet maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01500</link>

Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) can be tested via different astrophysical and cosmological probes. In particular, particles in the $\sim$ 9.5 - 30 eV mass range that decay into monochromatic photons, would contribute to the extragalactic background light (EBL) in the ultraviolet (UV) bandwidth. In this work, we show that an intriguing improvement to the constraints on such DDM models can come from broadband UV surveys, such as GALEX or the upcoming ULTRASAT satellite. These provide diffuse light maps of the UV EBL, integrated over a wide redshift range. The cross correlation between intensity fluctuations in these maps with a reference spectroscopic galaxy survey, can be used to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the EBL intensity; in this way, it is also possible to detect signatures of contributions from DDM. We forecast the constraining power of (GALEX+ULTRASAT)$\times$DESI, and we show they will be able to detect DDM with decay rate up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-26}\,{\rm s})$. In the context of axion-like particles (ALP), our forecasts can be converted to constraints on the ALP-photon coupling; our results show this technique will test ALP with coupling $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV^{-1}})$, more than an order of magnitude better than current bounds in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions and obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry of dilatations (Weyl-DBI). This is done in the Weyl gauge covariant formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, in which this geometry is metric. The Weyl-DBI action is a special gauge theory in that it has the same gauge invariant expression with dimensionless couplings in any dimension $d$, with no need for a UV regulator (be it a DR subtraction scale, field or higher derivative operator) for which reason we argue it is Weyl-anomaly free. For $d=4$ dimensions, the leading order of a series expansion of the Weyl-DBI action recovers the gauge invariant Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that is Weyl anomaly-free; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. All the remaining terms of this series expansion are of non-perturbative nature but can, in principle, be recovered by (perturbative) quantum corrections in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$ in a gauge invariant (geometric) regularisation, provided by the Weyl-DBI action. If the Weyl gauge boson is not dynamical the Weyl-DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action. All fields and scales have geometric origin, with no added matter, scalar field compensators or UV regulators.</description>

      <title>Analytic two-Loop four-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop four-point MHV form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). This form factor is analogous to the Higgs plus four-gluon amplitudes in the heavy-top limit of QCD when translated to the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM context. We obtain the full $D$-dimensional integrands up to two loops via unitarity-cut methods. Subsequently, we utilize IBP reduction to express the result in terms of a set of uniformly transcendental basis integrals, incorporating the two-loop non-planar five-point one-mass integrals recently given by Abreu et al. [PRL 132 (2024) 14]. We obtain the two-loop finite remainder in the functional form in terms of the pentagon functions. The symbol of our remainder confirms the bootstrap results reported by Dixon et al. [PRL 130 (2023) 11]. We perform various non-trivial checks of our results, including the triple-collinear limit, which recovers the two-loop six-gluon remainder. We also show that the form factor has a directional dual conformal symmetry at the integrand level. Our results are expected to shed further light on the study of antipodal dualities and the computation of Higgs plus four-parton amplitudes in QCD.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Two Excited $\Omega^{-}$ Hyperons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using $e^+e^-$ collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19,fb$^{-1}$ collected by the BESIII detector at center-of-mass energies ranging from 4.13 to 4.70,GeV, we report the first evidence for a new excited $\Omega^{-}$ hyperon, the $\Omega(2109)^{-}$, through the process $e^+ e^- \to \Omega(2109)^{-} \bar{\Omega}^{+} +c.c.$ with a significance of 4.1 $\sigma$. The mass and width of $\Omega(2109)^{-}$ are measured to be $2108.5 \pm 5.2_{\rm stat} \pm 0.9_{\rm syst}\,{\rm MeV}/c^{2}$ and $18.3 \pm 16.4_{\rm stat} \pm 5.7_{\rm syst}\,{\rm MeV}$, respectively. We also present evidence for a new production mechanism for the previously identified $\Omega(2012)^-$ via the process $e^+ e^- \to \Omega(2012)^{-} \bar{\Omega}^{+} +c.c.$ with a significance of 3.5 $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Transverse and longitudinal spin alignment from color fields in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spin alignment of vector mesons stemming from spin correlation of the quark and antiquark induced by background color fields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The quark-coalescence equation relating the collision kernel of the vector-meson kinetic equation to spin alignment is expanded to the relativistic case. Focusing on the color-octet contribution, the spin alignment for $\phi$ mesons from glasma fields with momentum dependence is investigated, where the scenarios for different spin quantization axes are considered. Moreover, we qualitatively analyze the spin alignment from isotropic color fields in the quark gluon plasma phase for comparison. In particular, we propose that the experimental measurement of spin alignment along the beam direction, dubbed as the longitudinal spin alignment, could be useful to identify the dominance of longitudinal spin correlation potentially led by the glasma effect in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations at small scales between $4.5\times 10^{18}$ and $1.8\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions</title>

Abstract: The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [45] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the main dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.</description>

      <title>Effects of a first-order QCD phase transition on light nucleus production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to describe the baryon density fluctuations of quark matter along the isentropic trajectories corresponding to different $s/\rho_B$ values extracted from Au+Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7-200$ GeV, we investigate the effects of the two-phase coexistence region during a first-order phase transition on the light nucleus yield ratio $N_t \times N_p/N_d^2$. The results indicate that the second-order scaled density moment $y_2$, used to quantify density fluctuations, rapidly increases to form a peak when the isentropic trajectories pass through the coexistence region. We extract the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ at chemical freeze-out from the isentropic trajectories at different collision energies and found significant enhancements at 19.6 GeV and 27 GeV. This is similar to the trends observed by the STAR experiment, suggesting that the enhancements in the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ observed in the STAR experiment could be explained by the density fluctuations generated in the first-order phase transition region.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to describe the charge-parity violating effects through axion field, we investigate the axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars. The properties of quark matter vary with the scaled axion field $a/f_a$ in a periodic manner, with a period of $2\pi$. Within the range from 0 to $\pi $, axion field decrease the baryon chemical potential of the first-order phase transition, leading to an increase in normalized pressure and stiffening of the quark matter equation of state. The effect of axions on hybrid star matter that includes the hadron-quark phase transition is contrary to expectations. The axion field shifts the onset of the hadron-quark mixed phase to lower densities but slightly softens the equation of state of the mixed phase matter, which also results in a slight decrease in the maximum mass and corresponding radius of the hybrid stars. However, we also find that the lowering of the onset of the mixed phase significantly increases the radius and mass of the quark-matter core in the hybrid star. Therefore, our results indicate with axion effects, a sizable quark-matter core can appear in $2M_{\odot}$ massive neutron stars.</description>
