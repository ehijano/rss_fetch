      <title>Flux Jumps up to 17 T in ReBCO Tape Stack Cables and their Suppression with Increased Intertape Spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetization of ReBCO tape stacks and tape stack cables in high magnetic fields (up to 30 T) are not commonly reported. Here we report magnetization measurements of tape stack cables in magnetic fields up to 30 T at 4.2 K. We observed that flux jumps, commonly relegated to low field regimes for single tapes, persisted up to 17 T in tape stacks, an effect which could have substantial technological relevance for high field applications including fusion devices or accelerator magnets. On the other hand, with the use of small spacers, we could suppress flux jump behavior, in some cases eliminating jumps entirely. Our findings provide critical insights for the optimization of designs for ReBCO cables for high-field applications, including fusion magnets and particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Superconducting vacancy-ordered rock-salt NbO films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of vacancy-ordered rocksalt NbO thin films which display superconductivity. A comparative study of substrates identifies Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) as the optimal platform for realizing high-quality, single-phase films when growing at temperatures exceeding 1000 $^\circ$C. The controlled NbO films exhibit superconductivity with critical temperatures up to $T_\mathrm{c}$ = 1.37 K, comparable to bulk single crystals. This work addresses the fundamental bottlenecks encountered in the high-temperature epitaxy of compounds with uncommon oxidation states, while expanding the scope of available thin-film superconductors.</description>

      <title>Linear scaling relation between two-dimensional massless Dirac fermion Fermi velocity and Fe-As bond length in iron arsenide superconductor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) massless Dirac fermions (MDF), which represent a type of quasi-particles with linear energy-momentum dispersions only in 2D momentum space, provide a fertile ground for realizing novel quantum phenomena. However, 2D MDF were seldom observed in the superconducting bulk states of 3D materials. Furthermore, as a cornerstone for accurately tuning the quantum phenomena based on 2D MDF, a quantitative relationship between 2D MDF and a structural parameter has rarely been revealed so far. Here, we report magneto-infrared spectroscopy studies of the iron-arsenide-superconductor systems NaFeAs and $A\mathrm{Fe_2As_2} (A = \mathrm{Ca, Ba})$ at temperature $T \sim 4.2 $ K and at magnetic fields ($B$) up to 17.5 T. Our results demonstrate the existence of 2D MDF in the superconducting bulk state of NaFeAs. Moreover, the 2D-MDF Fermi velocities in NaFeAs and $A\mathrm{Fe_2As_2} (A = \mathrm{Ca, Ba})$, which are extracted from the slopes of the linear $\sqrt{B}$ dependences of the Landau-level transition energies, scale linearly with the Fe-As bond lengths. The linear scaling between the 2D-MDF Fermi velocities and the Fe-As bond lengths is supported by (i) the linear relationship between the square root of the effective mass of the $d_{xy}$ electrons and the Fe-As bond length and (ii) the linear dependence of the square root of the calculated tight-binding hopping energy on the Fe-As bond length. Our results open up new avenues for exploring and tuning novel quantum phenomena based on 2D MDF in the superconducting bulk states of 3D materials.</description>

      <title>Majorana Zero Modes in a Heterogenous Structure of Topological and Trivial Domains in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the existence of vortices in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ with and without Majoarana zero modes (MZMs) can be explained by a heterogeneous mixture of strong topological and trivial superconducting domains, with only vortices in the former exhibiting MZMs. We identify the spectroscopic signatures of topological and trivial vortices and show that they are necessarily separated by a domain wall harboring Majorana edge modes. We demonstrate that when a vortex is moved from a trivial to a topological domain in real time, a domain wall Majorana edge mode is transferred to the vortex as an MZM.</description>

      <title>Geometric and conventional contributions of superconducting diode effect: Application to flat-band systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal critical supercurrents give rise to the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in noncentrosymmetric superconductors when time-reversal symmetry is broken. In this paper, we investigate the SDE in superconductors with vanishing spin-orbit coupling but featuring narrow bands near the Fermi energy -- a characteristic particularly relevant to moir\'{e} heterostructures, such as twisted bilayer graphene. Using phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and self-consistent mean-field approaches, we analyze the contributions to the SDE from both conventional band dispersion and quantum geometry. While the conventional SDE arises from the asymmetric Fermi surface, we demonstrate that the quantum metric dipole generates a band quantum-geometric contribution to the SDE, even in systems with symmetric single-particle dispersion. Notably, in the flat-band limit, where the attractive interaction strength significantly exceeds the bandwidth, the contributions from quantum geometry to the supercurrent and diode effect become dominant. Our paper elucidates the conventional and quantum-geometric origins of superconducting nonreciprocity and explores their implications for flat-band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Yin-Yang vortex on UTe2 (011) surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in local density of states on UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the conjugate structure of Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. By theoretical modeling, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on UTe2 (011) surface can be explained by the asymmetric vortex-derived local distortion of the zero-energy surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing with appropriate d-vectors. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex confirms the spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 and imposes constraints on the candidate d-vector for the spin-triplet pairing.</description>

      <title>Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH$_2$ under extreme conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydride apart from H$_2$S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the microscopic to macroscopic crossover using superconducting quantum impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Superconductivity Mediated by Majorana Fermions in the Kitaev-Kondo Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev--Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral $d$-wave or $p$-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.</description>
