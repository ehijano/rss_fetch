      <title>On the generalized Cauchy dual of closed operators in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the generalized Cauchy dual $w(T) = T(T^{*}T)^{\dagger}$ of a closed operator $T$ with the closed range between Hilbert spaces and present intriguing findings that characterize the Cauchy dual of $T$. Additionally, we establish the result $w(T^{n}) = (w(T))^{n}$, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $T$ is a quasinormal EP operator.</description>

      <title>On Mahler's conjecture for even s-concave functions in dimensions 1 and 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish different sharp forms of Mahler's conjecture for $s$-concave even functions in dimensions $n$, for $n=1$ and $2$, for $s&gt;-1/n$, thus generalizing our previous results in \cite{FN} on log-concave even functions in dimension 2, which corresponds to the case $s=0$. The functional volume product of an even $s$-concave function $g$ is \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}g(x)dx\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\mathcal{L}_{s}g(y)dy, \] where $\mathcal{L}_{s}g$ is the $s$-polar function associated to $g$. The analogue of Mahler's conjecture for even $s$-concave functions postulates that this quantity is minimized for the indicatrix of a cube for any $s&gt;-1/n$. In dimension $n=1$, we prove this conjecture for all $s\in(-1,0)$ (the case $s\ge0$ was established by the first author and Mathieu Meyer in \cite[page 17]{FM10}). In dimension $n=2$, we only consider the case $1/s\in\mathbb{Z}$: for $s&gt;0$, we establish Mahler's conjecture for general $s$-concave even functions; for $s&lt;0$, the situation is more involved, we only prove a sharp inequality for $s$-concave functions $g$ such that $g^s$ admits an asymptote in every direction. Notice that this set of functions is quite natural to consider, when $s&lt;0$, since it is the largest subset of $s$-concave functions stable by $s$-duality.</description>

      <title>On Bergman-Toeplitz operators in periodic planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spectra of Toeplitz operators $T_a $ with periodic symbols in Bergman spaces $A^2(\Pi)$ on unbounded periodic planar domains $\Pi$, which are defined as the union of infinitely many copies of the translated, bounded periodic cell $\varpi$. We introduce Floquet-transform techniques and prove a version of the band-gap-spectrum formula, which is well-known in the framework of periodic elliptic spectral problems and which describes the essential spectrum of $T_a$ in terms of the spectra of a family of Toepliz-type operators $T_{a,\eta}$ in the cell $\varpi$, where $\eta$ is the so-called Floquet variable.
  As an application, we consider periodic domains $\Pi_h$ containing thin geometric structures and show how to construct a Toeplitz operator $T_{\sf a}: A^2(\Pi_h) \to A^2(\Pi_h)$ such that the essential spectrum of $T_{\sf a}$ contains disjoint components which approximatively coincide with any given finite set of real numbers. Moreover, our method provides a systematic and illustrative way how to construct such examples by using Toeplitz operators on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ e.g. with radial symbols.
  Using a Riemann mapping one can then find a Toeplitz operator $T_a : A^2(\mathbb{D}) \to A^2(\mathbb{D})$ with a bounded symbol and with the same spectral properties as $T_{\sf a}$.</description>

      <title>Analytical obstructions to the weak approximation of Sobolev mappings into manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any integer $ p \geq 2 $, we construct a compact Riemannian manifold $ \mathcal{N} $, such that if $ \dim \mathcal{M} &gt; p $, there is a map in the Sobolev space of mappings $ W^{1,p} (\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ which is not a weak limit of smooth maps into $ \mathcal{N} $ due to a mechanism of analytical obstruction. For $ p = 4n - 1 $, the target manifold can be taken to be the sphere $ \mathbb{S}^{2n} $ thanks to the construction by Whitehead product of maps with nontrivial Hopf invariant, generalizing the result by Bethuel for $ p = 4n -1 = 3$. The results extend to higher order Sobolev spaces $ W^{s,p} $, with $ s \in \mathbb{R} $, $s \geq 1 $, $ sp \in \mathbb{N}$, and $ sp \ge 2 $.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic signal encoding by leaky integrate and fire, performance and uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrate and fire is a resource efficient time-encoding mechanism that summarizes into a signed spike train those time intervals where a signal's charge exceeds a certain threshold. We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover's (Wassertein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Positivity of state, trace, and moment polynomials, and applications in quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State, trace, and moment polynomials are polynomial expressions in several operator or random variables and positive functionals on their products (states, traces or expectations). While these concepts, and in particular their positivity and optimization, arose from problems in quantum information theory, yet they naturally fit under the umbrella of multivariate operator theory. This survey presents state, trace, and moment polynomials in a concise and unified way, and highlights their similarities and differences. The focal point is their positivity and optimization. Sums of squares certificates for unconstrained and constrained positivity (Positivstellens\"atze) are given, and parallels with their commutative and freely noncommutative analogs are discussed. They are used to design a convergent hierarchy of semidefinite programs for optimization of state, trace, and moment polynomials. Finally, circling back to the original motivation behind the derived theory, multiple applications in quantum information theory are outlined.</description>

      <title>On the local character of the extension of traces for Sobolev mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a mapping $u \colon \mathcal{M}'\to \mathcal{N}$, where $\mathcal{M}'$ and $ \mathcal{N}$ are compact Riemannian manifolds, is the trace of a Sobolev mapping $U \colon \mathcal{M}' \times [0, 1) \to \mathcal{N}$ if and only if it is on some open covering of $\mathcal{M}'$. In the global case where $\mathcal{M}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, this implies that the analytical obstructions to the extension of a mapping $u \colon \partial \mathcal{M}\to \mathcal{N}$ to some Sobolev mapping $U \colon \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{N}$ are purely local.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present generalizations and modifications of Eldan's Stochastic Localization process, extending it to incorporate non-Gaussian tilts, making it useful for a broader class of measures. As an application, we introduce new processes that enable the decomposition and analysis of non-quadratic potentials on the Boolean hypercube, with a specific focus on quartic polynomials. Using this framework, we derive new spectral gap estimates for tensor Ising models under Glauber dynamics, resulting in rapid mixing.</description>

      <title>The sharp $\sigma_2$-curvature inequality on the sphere in quantitative form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among all metrics on $\mathbb S^d$ with $d&gt;4$ that are conformal to the standard metric and have positive scalar curvature, the total $\sigma_2$-curvature, normalized by the volume, is uniquely (up to M\"obius transformations) minimized by the standard metric. We show that if a metric almost minimizes, then it is almost the standard metric (up to M\"obius transformations). This closeness is measured in terms of Sobolev norms of the conformal factor, and we obtain the optimal stability exponents for two different notions of closeness. This is a stability result for an optimization problem whose Euler-Lagrange equation is fully nonlinear.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the decay of the Laplace-P\'olya integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laplace-P\'olya integral, defined by $J_n(r) = \frac1\pi\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}^n t \cos(rt) \mathrm{d} t$, appears in several areas of mathematics. We study this quantity by combinatorial methods; accordingly, our investigation focuses on the values at integer $r$'s. Our main result establishes a lower bound for the ratio $\frac{J_n(r+2)}{J_n(r)}$ which extends and generalises the previous estimates of Lesieur and Nicolas obtained by involved analytic methods, and provides a natural counterpart to the upper estimate established in our previous work. We derive the statement by purely combinatorial, elementary arguments. As a corollary, we deduce that no subdiagonal central sections of the unit cube are extremal, apart from the minimal, maximal, and the main diagonal sections. We also prove several consequences for Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity from the perspective of the constraint-based ``dual'' formulations. We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification.
  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.</description>

Abstract: It is known that weak l-sequential supercyclicity implies weak quasistability, and it is still unknown weather weak l-sequential supercyclicity implies weak stability, much less whether weak supercyclicity implies weak stability (although it is known for a long time that strong supercyclicity implies strong stability). It is shown that weak l-sequential supercyclicity implies weak stability under the assumption of boundedly spaced subsequences. It is given an example of a power bounded quasistable operator which is not weakly stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the convergence properties of s-numbers of certain truncations of bounded linear operators between Banach spaces. We prove a generalized version of a known convergence result for the approximation numbers of truncations of operators, removing the restrictive assumption of separability from the underlying spaces. This generalization extends several existing results in the literature and establishes a close connection between two significant problems concerning approximation numbers. By exploring the relationships between approximation numbers and other prominent s-numbers, we also derive results on the convergence of s-numbers of truncations to those of the original operator, as applications of the generalized convergence result.</description>

Abstract: We provide new characterizations of Sobolev spaces that are true under some mild conditions. We study modified first order Sobolev spaces on metric measure spaces: $\mathrm{TC}$-Newtonian space, $\hat{\mathrm{TC}}$-Newtonian space, and Gigli-like space. We prove that if the measure is Borel regular and $\sigma$-finite, then the modified $\mathrm{TC}$-Newtonian space is equivalent to the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev space. Moreover, if additionally the measure is doubling then all modified spaces are equivalent to the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proved that: each collectively order continuous set of operators from an Archimedean ordered vector space to an ordered vector space is collectively order bounded; each collectively order to norm bounded set of operators from an ordered Banach space with a closed generating cone to a normed space is norm bounded; collectively r-continuous sets agree with collectively order bounded ones when the space in the range has a generating cone. Several applications to operator semigroups are given.</description>

      <title>Injective ellipticity, cancelling operators, and endpoint Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities for vector fields</title>

Abstract: Although Ornstein's nonestimate entails the impossibility to control in general all the $L^1$-norm of derivatives of a function by the $L^1$-norm of a constant coefficient homogeneous vector differential operator, the corresponding endpoint Sobolev inequality has been known to hold in many cases: the gradient of scalar functions (Gagliardo and Nirenberg), the deformation operator (Korn-Sobolev inequality by M.J. Strauss), and the Hodge complex (Bourgain and Brezis). The class of differential operators for which estimates holds can be characterized by a cancelling condition. The proof of the estimates rely on a duality estimate for $L^1$-vector fields lying in the kernel of a cocancelling differential operator, combined with classical linear algebra and harmonic analysis techniques. This characterization unifies classes of known Sobolev inequalities and extends to fractional Sobolev and Hardy inequalities. A similar weaker condition introduced by Rai\c{t}\u{a} characterizes the operators for which there is an $L^\infty$-estimate on lower-order derivatives.</description>

      <title>Smooth Banach structure on orbit spaces and leaf spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quotients of Banach manifolds with respect to free actions of pseudogroups of local diffeomorphisms. These quotient spaces are called H-manifolds since the corresponding simply transitive action of the pseudogroup on its orbits is regarded as a homogeneity condition. The importance of these structures stems from the fact that for every regular foliation without holonomy of a Banach manifold, the corresponding leaf space has the natural structure of an H-manifold. This is our main technical result, and one of its remarkable consequences is an infinite-dimensional version of Sophus Lie's third fundamental theorem, to the effect that every real Banach-Lie algebra can be integrated to an H-group, that is, a group object in the category of H-manifolds. In addition to these general results we discuss a wealth of examples of H-groups which are not Banach-Lie groups.</description>
