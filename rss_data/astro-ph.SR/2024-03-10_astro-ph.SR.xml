      <title>Concerning S$H_0$ES Data: Discrepant $W_{0,VI}$ Absolute Magnitudes for Cepheids in the Keystone Galaxy NGC4258</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S$H_0$ES $VI$-band photometry for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield discrepant absolute magnitudes. Specifically, the 2016 and 2022 published S$H_0$ES Cepheid data for NGC4258 exhibit a substantial offset of $\Delta W_{0,VI}\simeq0^{\rm m}.3$. That adds to a suite of existing concerns associated with the S$H_0$ES analysis, which in sum imply that their relatively non-changing Hubble constant for nearly twenty years should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Waves Driving Variability and Cloud Modulation on a Planetary-Mass Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs at the transition from relatively red L dwarfs to bluer mid-T dwarfs $\left(\rm{T}_{eff}\sim1300 \ \text{K} \right)$ show enhanced spectrophotometric variability. An open question is whether this variability is caused by atmospheric planetary-scale (Kelvin or Rossby) waves or by large spots associated with the precipitation of silicate and metal clouds. We applied both waves and spotted models to fit near-infrared (NIR), multi-band ($Y$/$J$/$H$/$K$) photometry of SIMP J013656.5+093347 (hereafter SIMP0136), collected at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope using the Wide-field InfraRed Camera. SIMP0136 is a planetary-mass object (12.7$\pm1.0 \ \rm{M_J}$) at the L/T transition (T2$\pm0.5$) known to exhibit light curve evolution over multiple rotational periods. We measure the maximum peak-to-peak variability of $6.17\pm0.46\%$, $6.45\pm0.33\%$, $6.51\pm0.42\%$, and $4.33\pm0.38\%$ in the $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands respectively, and find evidence that wave models are preferred for all four NIR bands. Furthermore, we determine the spot size necessary to reproduce the observed variations is larger than the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale, which is unphysical. Through the correlation between light curves produced by the waves and associated color variability, we find evidence of planetary-scale, wave-induced cloud modulation and breakup, similar to Jupiter's atmosphere and supported by general circulation models. We also detect a $93.8^{\circ}\pm7.4^{\circ}$ ($12.7\sigma$) phase shift between the $H-K$ and $J-H$ color time series, providing evidence for complex vertical cloud structure in SIMP0136's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>MINDS: JWST/NIRCam imaging of the protoplanetary disk PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk. JWST/NIRCam offers a unique opportunity to characterize them and their birth environment at wavelengths difficult to access from the ground. Aims. We aim to image the circumstellar environment of PDS 70 at 1.87 $\mu$m and 4.83 $\mu$m, assess the presence of Pa-$\alpha$ emission due to accretion onto the protoplanets, and probe any IR excess indicative of heated circumplanetary material. Methods. We obtain non-coronagraphic JWST/NIRCam images of PDS 70 within the MINDS (MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey) program. We leverage the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package for data reduction, and develop dedicated routines for optimal stellar PSF subtraction, unbiased imaging of the disk, and protoplanet flux measurement in this type of dataset. A radiative transfer model of the disk is used to disentangle the contributions from the disk and the protoplanets. Results. We re-detect both protoplanets and identify extended emission after subtracting a disk model, including a large-scale spiral-like feature. We interpret its signal in the direct vicinity of planet c as tracing the accretion stream feeding its circumplanetary disk, while the outer part of the feature may rather reflect asymmetric illumination of the outer disk. We also report a bright signal consistent with a previously proposed protoplanet candidate enshrouded in dust, near the 1:2:4 mean-motion resonance with planets b and c. The 1.87 $\mu$m flux of planet b is consistent with atmospheric model predictions, but not that of planet c. We discuss potential origins for this discrepancy, including significant Pa-$\alpha$ line emission. The 4.83 $\mu$m fluxes of planets b and c suggest enshrouding dust or heated CO emission from their circumplanetary environment.</description>

      <title>The extreme coronal line emitter AT 2022fpx: Varying optical polarization properties and late-time X-ray flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes have been known to disrupt passing stars, producing outbursts called tidal disruption events (TDEs). TDEs have recently gained attention due to their unique dynamics and emission processes, which are still not fully understood. Especially, the so-called optical TDEs, are of interest as they often exhibit delayed or obscured X-ray emission from the accretion disk, making the origin of the prompt emission unclear. In this paper, we present the optical photo-, spectro-, and polarimetry of a recent TDE candidate AT 2022fpx, in addition to accompanying monitoring observations in ultraviolet and X-rays. The optical spectra of AT 2022fpx show Bowen fluorescence as well as highly-ionized iron emission lines, which are characteristic of extreme coronal line emitters. Additionally, the source exhibits variable but low-polarized emission at the outburst peak, with a clear rotation of the polarization angle. X-ray emission observed later in the decay appear flare-like but is consistent with constant temperature black-body emission. The overall outburst decay is slower than for typical TDEs, and resembles more the ones seen from Bowen fluorescence flares. These observations suggest that AT 2022fpx could be a key source in linking different long-lived TDE scenarios. Its unique characteristics, such as the extreme coronal line emission, variable polarization, and the delayed X-ray flare, can be attributed to the outer shock scenario or a clumpy torus surrounding the supermassive black hole. Further studies, especially in the context of multi-wavelength observations, are crucial to fully understand the dynamics and emission mechanisms of these intriguing astrophysical events.</description>

      <title>Constraining Mass Transfer Models with Galactic Neutron Star$-$White Dwarf Binaries as Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star$-$white dwarf (NSWD) binaries are one of the most abundant sources of gravitational waves (GW) in the Milky Way. These GW sources are the evolutionary products of primordial binaries that experienced many processes of binary interaction. We employ a binary population synthesis method to investigate the properties of Galactic NSWD binaries detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this paper, only the NSWD systems with a COWD or ONeWD component are included. We consider various models related to mass transfer efficiencies during primordial binary evolution, supernova explosion mechanisms at NS formation, common envelope ejection efficiencies, and critical WD masses that determining the stability of mass transfer between WDs and NSs. Based on our calculations, we estimate that tens to hundreds of LISA NSWD binaries exist in the Milky Way. We find that the detection of LISA NSWD binaries is able to provide profound insights into mass transfer efficiencies during the evolution of primordial binaries and critical WD masses during mass transfer from a WD to an NS.</description>

      <title>Vertical and radial distribution of atomic carbon in HD 163296</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In protoplanetary disks, atomic carbon is expected to originate from the PDR at the disk surface where CO is dissociated by UV photons coming from the stellar, or external interstellar, radiation field. Even though atomic carbon has been detected in several protoplanetary disks, there is a lack of spatially resolved observations of it. For HD 163296 protoplanetary disk, we aim to obtain both radial and vertical structure of [CI]$={^3}{P_1} - {^3}{P_0}$ line emission and perform the first direct comparison of this tracer with optically thick line emission $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$. We used archival ALMA data for [CI]$={^3}{P_1} - {^3}{P_0}$ and previously published ${^{12}}$ CO $J=2-1$ data in HD 163296. Through the software of disksurf we extracted the vertical structure, meanwhile radial profiles were obtained directly from imaging. Brand new DALI modelling was employed to perform direct comparison to the data. We found that these tracers are collocated radially but not vertically, where $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ emission is, on average, located at higher altitudes, as it is also the case for other tracers in the same disk. Due to this difference in vertical height of the emission, the optically thick $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ emission line appears to trace the highest altitudes, despite the expected formation mechanism of [CI] in the disk. The latter phenomena may be due to efficient mixing of the upper layers of the disk, or UV photons penetrating deeper than we expected.</description>

      <title>Improving the open cluster census. III. Using cluster masses, radii, and dynamics to create a cleaned open cluster catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The census of open clusters has exploded in size thanks to data from the Gaia satellite. However, it is likely that many of these reported clusters are not gravitationally bound, making the open cluster census impractical for many scientific applications. We test different physically motivated methods for distinguishing between bound and unbound clusters, using them to create a cleaned cluster catalogue. We derived completeness-corrected photometric masses for 6956 clusters from our earlier work. Then, we used these masses to compute the size of the Roche surface of these clusters (their Jacobi radius) and distinguish between bound and unbound clusters. We find that only 5647 (79%) of the clusters from our previous catalogue are compatible with bound open clusters, dropping to just 11% of clusters within 250 pc. 3530 open clusters are in a strongly cut high quality sample. The moving groups in our sample show different trends in their size as a function of age and mass, suggesting that they are unbound and undergoing different dynamical processes. Our cluster mass measurements constitute the largest catalogue of Milky Way cluster masses to date, which we also use for further science. Firstly, we inferred the mass-dependent completeness limit of the open cluster census, showing that the census is complete within 1.8 kpc only for objects heavier than 230 M$_\odot$. Next, we derived a completeness-corrected age and mass function for our open cluster catalogue, including estimating that the Milky Way contains a total of $1.3 \times 10^5$ open clusters, only ~4% of which are currently known. Finally, we show that most open clusters have mass functions compatible with the Kroupa initial mass function. We demonstrate Jacobi radii for distinguishing between bound and unbound star clusters, and publish an updated star cluster catalogue with masses and improved cluster classifications.

      <title>Swift monitoring of GK Persei during the 2018 dwarf nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The old nova and intermediate polar (IP) GK Persei underwent one of its recurrent dwarf nova (DN) outbursts in 2018. We proposed monitoring it in UV and X-rays with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, starting less than six days after the eruption, until 16 days after the eruption ended. For the first time we could follow the decay to minimum light UV and X-rays. We present the timing and spectral analysis, comparing the results with the previous outbursts and with the quiescent status. We confirm the spin modulation in X-rays with a period 351.325(9) s, only in the 2-10 keV range. The period was not detected in the 0.3-2 keV range and in the UV band, suggesting that the soft portion of the X-ray spectrum in GK Per does not originate near the poles, but in a wind or circumstellar material. The amplitude of the modulation was less prominent than in 2015, a fact that seems correlated with a lower average mass accretion rate. The spectral fits are consistent with a mass accretion rate increasing by a factor of 2 from rise to maximum and decreasing during the return to minimum, following the trend of the modulation amplitude. The maximum plasma temperature is higher than the Swift XRT energy range of 0.3-10 keV, thus it is not well constrained, but our spectral fits indicate that it may have varied irregularly during the outburst.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The WST Science Team (already including more than 500 scientists worldwide) is open to the all astronomical community.

      <title>Streaming instability in neutron star magnetospheres: No indication of soliton-like waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent radiation of pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts could, in theory, be interpreted as radiation from solitons and soliton-like waves. The solitons are meant to contain a large number of electric charges confined on long time-scales and may radiate strongly by coherent curvature emission. However, solitons are also known to undergo a wave collapse, which may cast doubts on the correctness of the soliton radio emission models of neutron stars.
  We investigate the evolution of the caviton type of solitons self-consistently formed by the relativistic streaming instability and compare their apparent stability in 1D calculations with more generic 2D cases, in which the solitons are seen to collapse. Three representative cases of beam Lorentz factors and plasma temperatures are studied to obtain soliton dispersion properties. We utilized 1D electrostatic and 2D electromagnetic relativistic particle-in-cell simulations at kinetic microscales.
  We found that no solitons are generated by the streaming instability in the 2D simulations. Only superluminal L-mode (relativistic Langmuir) waves are produced during the saturation of the instability, but these waves have smaller amplitudes than the waves in the 1D simulations. The amplitudes tend to decrease after the instability has saturated, and only waves close to the light line, $\omega = c k$, remain. Solitons in the 1D approach are stable for $\gamma_\mathrm{b} \gtrsim 60$, but they disappear for low beam Lorentz factor $\gamma_\mathrm{b} &lt; 6$.
  Our examples show that the superluminal soliton branch that is formed in 1D simulations will not be generated by the relativistic streaming instability when more dimensional degrees of freedom are present - unless one can show that there are alternative plasma mechanisms for the soliton generation.</description>

Abstract: The $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction, determining the survival of carbon in red giants, is of interest for nuclear reaction theory and nuclear astrophysics. A specific feature of the $^{16}$O nuclear structure is the presence of two subthreshold bound states, (6.92 MeV, 2$^+$) and (7.12 MeV, 1$^-$), that dominate the behavior of the low-energy $S$-factor. The strength of these subthreshold states is determined by their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs), which need to be known with high accuracy. Recently, using a model-independent extrapolation method, Blokhintsev {\it et al.} [Eur. Phys. J. A {\bf 59} (2023) 162] determined the ANCs for the $\alpha$-particle removal taking into account three subthreshold states in $^{16}$O. The goal of this paper is to address four main problems elucidating the impact of the subthreshold ANCs on the low-energy $S$-factor. Firstly, we analyse the connection between variations of the subthreshold ANCs and the low-energy $S$-factor, in particular, at the most effective energy of $300$ keV. Secondly, we calculate contributions to the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor from the subthreshold $1^{-}$ and $2^{+}$ resonances, that are controlled by the subthreshold ANCs. We also evaluate the contribution of the uncertainties of the subthreshold ANCs to the budget of the low-energy $S$-factor uncertainty, especially, the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor. Thirdly, we analyse interference of the subthreshold resonances (SRs) with higher resonances and with the $E1$ and $E2$ direct captures to the ground state. Finally, we investigate a correlated effect of the subthreshold and ground-state ANCs on the low-energy $S$-factor and, in particular, on the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor.</description>

Abstract: Streamers bring gas from outer regions to protostellar systems and could change the chemical composition around protostars and protoplanetary disks. We have carried out mapping observations of carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, CCH, and CCS) in the 3mm and 7mm bands toward the streamer flowing to the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) Per-emb-2 with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope. A region with a diameter of $\sim0.04$ pc is located north with a distance of $\sim 20,500$ au from the YSO. The streamer connects to this north region which is the origin of the streamer. The reservoir has high density and low temperature ($n_{\rm {H}_2} \approx 1.9 \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\rm {kin}} = 10$ K), which are similar to those of early stage starless cores. By comparisons with the observed abundance ratios of CCS/HC$_3$N to the chemical simulations, the reservoir and streamer are found to be chemically young. The total mass available for the streamer is derived to be $24-34$ M$_{\odot}$. If all of the gas in the reservoir will accrete onto the Per-emb-2 protostellar system, the lifetime of the streamer has been estimated at ($1.1 - 3.2$)$\times10^{5}$ yr, suggesting that the mass accretion via the streamer would continue until the end of the Class I stage.</description>
