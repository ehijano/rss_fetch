      <title>Symmetry-breaking bifurcations of pure-quartic solitons in dual-core couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous symmetry- and antisymmetry-breaking bifurcations of solitons in a nonlinear dual-core waveguide with the pure-quartic dispersion and Kerr nonlinearity. Symmetric, antisymmetric, and asymmetric pure-quartic solitons (PQSs) are found, and their stability domains are identified. The bifurcations for both the symmetric and antisymmetric PQSs are of the supercritical type (alias phase transitions of the second kind). Direct simulations of the perturbed evolution of PQSs corroborate their stability boundaries predicted by the analysis of small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Patterns in Active Four-State Potts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many types of spatiotemporal patterns have been observed under nonequilibrium conditions. Cycling through four or more states can provide specific dynamics, such as the spatial coexistence of multiple phases. However, transient dynamics have only been studied by previous theoretical models, since absorbing transition into a uniform phase covered by a single state occurs in the long-time limit. Here, we reported steady long-term dynamics using cyclic Potts models, wherein nucleation and growth play essential roles. Under the cyclic symmetry of the four states, the cyclic changes in the dominant phases and the spatial coexistence of the four phases are obtained at low and high flipping energies, respectively. Under asymmetric conditions, the spatial coexistence of two diagonal phases appears in addition to non-cyclic one-phase modes. The circular domains of the diagonal state are formed by the nucleation of other states, and they slowly shrink to reduce the domain boundary. When three-state cycling is added, competition between the two cycling modes changes the spatiotemporal patterns.</description>

      <title>$\bar{\partial}$-problem for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and soliton shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider soliton gas solutions of the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, where the point spectrum of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator condensate in a bounded domain $\mathcal{D}$ in the upper half-plane. We show that the corresponding inverse scattering problem can be formulated as a $\overline{\partial}$-problem on the domain. We prove the existence of the solution of this $\overline{\partial}$-problem by showing that the $\tau$-function of the problem (a Fredholm determinant) does not vanish. We then represent the solution of the NLS equation via the $\tau$ of the $\overline{\partial}$- problem. Finally we show that, when the domain $\mathcal{D}$ is an ellipse and the density of solitons is analytic, the initial datum of the Cauchy problem is asymptotically step-like oscillatory, and it is described by a periodic elliptic function as $x \to - \infty$ while it vanishes exponentially fast as $x \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Modulation theory of soliton-mean flow in KdV equation with box type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with box type initial data, the interaction between a trial soliton and large-scale dispersive mean flow is studied theoretically and numerically. The pure box initial value can cause rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave, and can create an area of soliton train. The key to the interaction of soliton and mean flow is that the dynamic evolutions of the mean flow and the local soliton can be described by the same modulation system. The soliton modulation system is derived from the degenerations of the two-genus Whitham modulation system. Considering the influence of rarefaction wave, dispersive shock wave and soliton train on the trial soliton, in the framework of Whitham modulation theory, the equation describing the soliton trajectory and the changes in amplitude and phase shift are given explicitly. The predicted results are compared with the numerical simulations, which verifies the corrections of the theoretical analysis. The exotic interaction phenomena between soliton and mean flow found in this work have broad applications to shallow water soliton propagations and real soliton experiments in fluid dynamics.</description>
