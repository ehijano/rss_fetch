      <title>Multiscale energy transfers in a forced two-DOF oscillatory system with a grounded nonlinear energy sink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the steady-state oscillations and the corresponding energy transfers in the two-DOF mechanical system with a grounded nonlinear energy sink (NES), under an external excitation. Based on the complexification-multiscale method, the slow frequency and the fast frequency of the complex amplitudes on the invariant manifold are analyzed, without omitting any terms. The analytical results show that the complex amplitudes of the primary system responses contain only the slow frequency, while that of the NES responses can contain both the slow frequency and the fast frequency when it triggers the high-order frequency term. In addition, each type of set on the invariant manifold represents the corresponding steady-state oscillations of the system, that is, the fixed point corresponds to the stationary oscillation, the interval corresponds to the nonlinear beat, and the hysteresis loop corresponds to the relaxation oscillation. Accordingly, we rewrite the forms of the complexification system to match the corresponding types of steady-state oscillations. Furthermore, the Hilbert-Huang transform is used to investigate the time-frequency relation of the displacements and the energies of the three steady-state responses. The Hilbert spectrums indicate that there is no energy transfer in the stationary oscillations, the O({\epsilon})/O({\epsilon}) type of energy transfer in the nonlinear beats, and the O({\epsilon})/O({\epsilon}) and the O({\epsilon})/O(1) types of energy transfer in the relaxation oscillations. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Parametric Autoresonance with Time-Delayed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how a constant time delay influences a parametric autoresonant system. This is a nonlinear system driven by a parametrically chirped force with a negative delay-feedback that maintains adiabatic phase locking with the driving frequency. This phase locking results in a continuous amplitude growth, regardless of parameter changes. Our study reveals a critical threshold for delay strength; above this threshold, autoresonance is sustained, while below it, autoresonance diminishes. We examine the interplay between time delay and autoresonance stability, using multi-scale perturbation methods to derive analytical results, which are corroborated by numerical simulations. Ultimately, the goal is to understand and control autoresonance stability through the time-delay parameters. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Ghost states underlying spatial and temporal patterns: how non-existing invariant solutions control nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to a saddle-node bifurcation, when two invariant solutions collide and disappear, the behavior of a dynamical system can closely resemble that of a solution which is no longer present at the chosen parameter value. For bifurcating equilibria in low-dimensional ODEs, the influence of such 'ghosts' on the temporal behavior of the system, namely delayed transitions, has been studied previously. We consider spatio-temporal PDEs and characterize the phenomenon of ghosts by defining representative state-space structures, which we term 'ghost states,' as minima of appropriately chosen cost functions. Using recently developed variational methods, we can compute and parametrically continue ghost states of equilibria, periodic orbits, and other invariant solutions. We demonstrate the relevance of ghost states to the observed dynamics in various nonlinear systems including chaotic maps, the Lorenz ODE system, the spatio-temporally chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE, the buckling of an elastic arc, and 3D Rayleigh-B\'enard convection.</description>

      <title>Long-window hybrid variational data assimilation methods for chaotic climate models tested with the Lorenz 63 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hybrid 4D-variational data assimilation method for chaotic climate models is introduced using the Lorenz '63 model. This approach aims to optimise an Earth system model (ESM), for which no adjoint exists, by utilising an adjoint model of a different, potentially simpler ESM. The technique relies on synchronisation of the model to observed time series data employing the dynamical state and parameter estimation (DSPE) method to stabilise the tangent linear system by reducing all positive Lyapunov exponents to negative values. Therefore, long windows can be used to improve parameter estimation. In this new extension a second layer of synchronisation is added between the two models, with and without an adjoint, to facilitate linearisation around the trajectory of the model without an adjoint. The method is conceptually demonstrated by synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems, representing two ESMs, one with and the other without an adjoint model. Results are presented for an idealised case of identical, perfect models and for a more realistic case in which they differ from one another. If employed with a coarser ESM with an adjoint, the method will save computational power as only one forward run with the full ESM per iteration needs to be carried out. It is demonstrated that there is negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the 'traditional' optimisation of full ESM with an adjoint. In a variation of the method outlined, synchronisation between two identical models can be used to filter noisy data. This reduces optimised parametric model uncertainty by approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.</description>
