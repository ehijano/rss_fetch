      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the defocusing-defocusing coupled Hirota equations with non-parallel boundary conditions at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse scattering transform for the defocusing-defocusing coupled Hirota equations is strictly discussed with non-zero boundary conditions at infinity including non-parallel boundary conditions, specifically referring to the asymptotic polarization vectors. To address the non-analyticity encountered in some of the Jost eigenfunctions, the "adjoint" Lax pair is employed. The inverse problem is formulated as an appropriate matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. A key difference between non-parallel and parallel boundary conditions lies in the asymptotic behavior of the scattering coefficients, which significantly impacts the normalization of the eigenfunctions and the properties of sectionally meromorphic matrices within the Riemann-Hilbert problem framework. When the asymptotic polarization vectors are non-orthogonal, two distinct methodologies are introduced to convert the Riemann-Hilbert problem into a series of linear algebraic-integral equations. In contrast, when the asymptotic polarization vectors are orthogonal, only one method is feasible. Ultimately, it is demonstrated that pure soliton solutions do not exist in both orthogonal and non orthogonal polarization vector cases. This study provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the defocusing-defocusing coupled Hirota equations using the inverse scattering transform, offering new insights into the characteristics and solutions of the equations.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian 1-form structure of Calogero-Moser type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the variational principle for the Lagrangian 1-form structure for long-range
  models of Calogero-Moser (CM) type. The multiform variational principle involves variations
  with respect to both the field variables as well as the independent variables
  corresponding to deformations of the time-curves in a multi-time space. The ensuing
  generalised Euler-Lagrange (gEL) equations comprise a system of multi-time
  EL equations, as well as constraints from so-called `alien derivatives' and `corner
  equations' arising from how variations on different coordinate curves match up.
  The closure relation, i.e. closedness of the Lagrange 1-form on solutions of the EL
  system, guarantees the stationarity of the action functional under deformation of the
  time-curves, and hence the multidimensional consistency of the corresponding gEL
  system. Using this as an integrability criterion on the Lagrangian level, we apply the
  system to some ans\"atze on the kinetic form of the Lagrangian components, associated
  with models of CM type without specifying the potentials. We show that from this
  integrability criterion the general elliptic form of the three systems,
  Calogero-Moser, Ruijsenaars-Schneider, and Goldfish systems, can be derived.
  We extend the analysis to an associated Hamiltonian formalism, via Noether's theorem
  and by applying Legendre transformations. Thus, the multiform variational principle
  leads to a system of generalised Hamilton equations describing Hamiltonian commuting flows for the mentioned elliptic models.</description>
