      <title>Helping introductory physics students connect physics with humanities, art, social sciences, and everyday life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we reflect upon our positive experiences incorporating or working on extra credit projects in algebra-based introductory physics that asked students to connect physics with humanities, social sciences, and everyday life. We give an example of a student project that reflects their creativity and ingenuity and encourages other instructors to offer similar projects.</description>

      <title>A Quantum of Hope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public outreach in quantum science and technologies has many goals, ranging from generating interest and dampening hype to making the fascinating and complex topic more accessible. In this work, we present a play on quantum science and technologies aimed at a science-curious audience, which aims to lift the curtains on different researchers' perspectives on this rapidly evolving field. These notes expand on the ideas presented in the play and provide additional sources that may be useful for educators and directors in future productions.
  In "A Quantum of Hope", the end of the world has never looked so bureaucratic. When an alien civilization announces that Earth will be demolished to make way for a research station, humanity is given five years to prove its value. The evaluation criteria? Randomly chosen to be quantum science and technologies. Five experts, sampled from quantum academia and industry, are locked in a room to select a single project proposal to unite global efforts. Douglas Adams meets 12 Angry Men in a galactic-grade grant review committee, where scientific ideas, moral convictions, and unruly egos clash.</description>

      <title>Combining physics education and machine learning research to measure evidence of students' mechanistic sensemaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning (ML) offer new possibilities for science education research. We report on early progress in the design of an ML-based tool to analyze students' mechanistic sensemaking, working from a coding scheme that is aligned with previous work in physics education research (PER) and amenable to recently developed ML classification strategies using language encoders. We describe pilot tests of the tool, in three versions with different language encoders, to analyze sensemaking evident in college students' written responses to brief conceptual questions. The results show, first, that the tool's measurements of sensemaking can achieve useful agreement with a human coder, and, second, that encoder design choices entail a tradeoff between accuracy and computational expense. We discuss the promise and limitations of this approach, providing examples as to how this measurement scheme may serve PER in the future. We conclude with reflections on the use of ML to support PER research, with cautious optimism for strategies of co-design between PER and ML.</description>
