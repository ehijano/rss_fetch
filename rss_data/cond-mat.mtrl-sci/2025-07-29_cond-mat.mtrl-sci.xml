      <title>Van der Waals injection-molded crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shaping low-dimensional crystals into precise geometries with low disorder is an outstanding challenge. Here, we present a method to grow single crystals of arbitrary geometry within van der Waals (vdW) materials. By injecting molten material between atomically-flat vdW layers within an SiO2 mold, we produce ultraflat and thin crystals of bismuth, tin, and indium that are shaped as hallbars, rings, and nanowires. The crystals are grown fully encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, a vdW material, providing protection from oxidation. Varying the depth of the mold allows us to control the crystal thickness from ten to a hundred nanometers. Structural measurements demonstrate large single-crystals encompassing the entire mold geometry, while transport measurements show reduced disorder scattering. This approach offers a means to produce complex single-crystal nanostructures without the disorder introduced by post-growth nanofabrication.</description>

      <title>Learning disentangled latent representations facilitates discovery and design of functional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of new materials is often constrained by the need for large labelled datasets or expensive simulations. In this study, we explore the use of Disentangling Autoencoders (DAEs) to learn compact and interpretable representations of spectral data in an entirely unsupervised manner. We demonstrate that the DAE captures physically meaningful features in optical absorption spectra, relevant to photovoltaic (PV) performance, including a latent dimension strongly correlated with the Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME)--despite being trained without access to SLME labels. This feature corresponds to a well-known spectral signature: the transition from direct to indirect optical band gaps. Compared to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a beta-Variational Autoencoder (beta-VAE), the DAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity, improved correlation with efficiency metrics, and more compact encoding of relevant features. We further show that the DAE latent space enables more efficient discovery of high-performing PV materials, identifying top candidates using fewer evaluations than both VAE-guided and random search. These results highlight the potential of DAEs as a powerful tool for unsupervised structure-property learning and suggest broad applicability to other areas of materials discovery where labeled data is limited but rich structure is present in raw signals.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient machine-learning of complex Fe-Mo intermetallics using domain knowledge of chemistry and crystallography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of multi-component systems require accurate descriptions of interatomic interactions to resolve details in the energy of competing phases. A particularly challenging case are topologically close-packed (TCP) phases with close energetic competition of numerous different site occupations even in binary systems like Fe-Mo. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are presented that overcome this challenge by using features with domain knowledge of chemistry and crystallography. The resulting data-efficient ML models need only a small set of training data of simple TCP phases $A$15, $\sigma$, $\chi$, $\mu$, $C$14, $C$15, $C$36 with 2-5 WS to reach robust and accurate predictions for the complex TCP phases $R$, $M$, $P$, $\delta$ with 11-14 WS. Several ML models with kernel-ridge regression, multi-layer perceptrons, and random forests, are trained on less than 300 DFT calculations for the simple TCP phases in Fe-Mo. The performance of these ML models is shown to improve systematically with increased utilization of domain knowledge. The convex hulls of the $R$, $M$, $P$ and $\delta$ phase in the Fe-Mo system are predicted with uncertainties of 20-25 meV/atom and show very good agreement with DFT verification. Complementary X-ray diffraction experiments and Rietveld analysis are carried out for an Fe-Mo R-phase sample. The measured WS occupancy is in excellent agreement with the predictions of our ML model using the Bragg Williams approximation at the same temperature.</description>

      <title>Making atomistic materials calculations accessible with the AiiDAlab Quantum ESPRESSO app</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the wide availability of density functional theory (DFT) codes, their adoption by the broader materials science community remains limited due to challenges such as software installation, input preparation, high-performance computing setup, and output analysis. To overcome these barriers, we introduce the Quantum ESPRESSO app, an intuitive, web-based platform built on AiiDAlab that integrates user-friendly graphical interfaces with automated DFT workflows. The app employs a modular Input-Process-Output model and a plugin-based architecture, providing predefined computational protocols, automated error handling, and interactive results visualization. We demonstrate the app's capabilities through plugins for electronic band structures, projected density of states, phonon, infrared/Raman, X-ray and muon spectroscopies, Hubbard parameters (DFT+$U$+$V$), Wannier functions, and post-processing tools. By extending the FAIR principles to simulations, workflows, and analyses, the app enhances the accessibility and reproducibility of advanced DFT calculations and provides a general template to interface with other first-principles calculation codes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state, critical analysis of magnetization, and large magnetocaloric effect in the ferromagnetically coupled kagome lattice YCa$_3$(MnO)$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed study of the magnetic properties, critical analysis of magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect of a spin-$2$ kagome lattice YCa$_3$(MnO)$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$. The experiments are complemented by the density functional band structure calculations. The magnetic measurements suggest a highly frustrated nature of the compound due to competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions with the dominant one being ferromagnetic. It undergoes a unconventional ferromagnetic ordering at $T^* \simeq 7.8$ K and a field induced metamagnetic transition in low fields, implying spin canting. A $H$-$T$ phase diagram is constructed that features three phase regimes. Indeed, the band structure calculations reveal dominant ferromagnetic interaction along the chains that are coupled antiferromagnetically yielding a frustrated kagome geometry. This compound shows a large magnetocaloric effect with isothermal entropy change $\Delta S_{\rm m} \simeq 12$ J/kg-K, adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{\rm ad} \simeq 8.4$ K, and relative cooling power $RCP \simeq 349$ J/kg for a field change of 7 T. The critical analysis of magnetization and magnetocaloric parameters suggests that the transition is a second order phase transition and it is tricritical mean field type. Owing to it's large magnetocaloric parameters, second order phase transition, and no thermal hysteresis, YCa$_3$(MnO)$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ emerges as a potential rare-earth free material for magnetic refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Band-selective Plasmonic Polaron in Thermoelectric Semimetal Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ with ultra-high power factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the electronic structure of the thermoelectric semimetal Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ with a large thermoelectric power factor and giant Peltier conductivity by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The ARPES spectra reveal the coexistence of a sharp hole band with a light electron mass and a broad electron band with a relatively heavy electron mass, which originate from different quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) chains in Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$. Moreover, the electron band around the Brillouin-zone (BZ) boundary shows a replica structure with respect to the energy originating from plasmonic polarons due to electron-plasmon interactions. The different scattering effects and interactions in each atomic chain lead to asymmetric transport lifetimes of carriers: a large Seebeck coefficient can be realized even in a semimetal. Our findings pave the way for exploring the thermoelectric materials in previously overlooked semimetals and provide a new platform for low-temperature thermoelectric physics, which has been challenging with semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Materials Discovery with Valence Constrained Design in Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based deep generative models have emerged as powerful tools for inverse materials design. Yet, many existing approaches overlook essential chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator with Valence-Constrained Design), a modular framework that integrates chemical rules directly into the generative process. CrysVCD first employs a transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced compositions, followed by a diffusion model to generate crystal structures. The valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal conductivity semiconductors and high-$\kappa$ dielectric compounds. Designed as a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically grounded path for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive first principles investigation of A$_2$BH$_6$ type (A= Li,Na, and K; B= Al, and Si) double perovskite hydrides for high capacity hydrogen storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in vacancy-ordered double perovskite hydride materials have underscored their significant potential for integration into next-generation high-capacity hydrogen energy storage systems. We perform extensive first principles calculations leveraging both the GGA and hybrid-HSE06 functionals to systematically explore the intrinsic properties of A$_2$BH$_6$ complex hydrides. Thermodynamic stability for each hydride is demonstrated and confirmed by negative formation energies, determined by both the GGA and HSE06 formalisms. Additionally, mechanical stability is validated through compliance with Born's stability criteria. Electronic properties analysis reveals a semiconducting behavior in Si based hydrides (A2SiH6 ), whereas Al based (A$_2$AlH$_6$) display metallic nature, regardless of the A site atoms and functionals adopted. For the semiconducting hydrides, we have observed higher optical absorption peak greater than 106 (1/cm) in the UV regime indicating potential application in UV-optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, all studied compounds adhere to Debye's low-temperature specific heat behavior and converge to the classical Dulong-Petit limit at elevated temperatures, in accordance with fundamental thermodynamic principles. For hydrogen storage applications, both Al- and Si-based hydrides. meet key benchmarks set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), achieving gravimetric hydrogen capacities (C$_{wt}$) exceeding 5.5 percent when A = Li or Na, and exhibiting volumetric hydrogen densities greater than 40 g.H2/L. Among all studied hydrides, Li$_2$AlH$_6$ and Li$_2$SiH$_6$ emerge as the two most promising candidates due to their outstanding Cwt greater than 12.0 percent , elevated density greater than 140 g.H$_2$/L, and favorable hydrogen desorption temperature ranges TD = 450 to 650 K.</description>

      <title>Unraveling a chemical-bond-driven root of topology in three-dimensional chiral crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality manifests across multiple scales, yielding unique phenomena that break mirror symmetry. In chiral materials, unexpectedly large spin-filtering or photogalvanic effects have been observed even in materials composed of light elements, implying crucial influence of their topological electronic states. However, an underlying framework that links chemical bonding and electronic topology remains elusive, preventing the rational design of quantum chiral properties. Here we identify the chiral bonding network responsible for multifold topological fermions by combining synchrotron X-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations on cubic chiral crystals, CoSi and FeSi. Based on the observations of asymmetric valence electron distributions around the transition metals, together with analyses of their bonding to sevenfold-coordinated silicon atoms, we develop a three-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, showing that inter-site hopping on this chiral network creates multifold fermions with doubled topological invariants. Topological features can be switched by reversing the crystalline chirality or tuning electron filling. Our results highlight that implementing strong spin-orbit coupling is not the sole route to realize robust topological phases at elevated temperatures and offer a practical design principle for exploiting chiral topology. Moreover, this real-space framework naturally extends to other elementary excitations or artificial metamaterials, enabling various quantum functionalities through an intuitive approach to chirality engineering.</description>

      <title>Specifics of ITO properties deposited on cerium-doped glass for space-grade solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ce-doped glass is a well-established solution for ultraviolet and ionizing radiation shielding of solar cells in space. Traditionally, Ce-glass protected Si or III-V based devices as an overlaying cap. However, for emerging photovoltaics such as halide perovskites, thin Ce-glass coated with transparent conductive layers could serve as a lightweight carrier with an electrode. While indium-tin oxide (ITO) is widely used in solar cells for charge collection, its optical, structural, and electrical properties depend on the substrate quality. In this work, we demonstrated significant differences in properties of ITO deposited on Ce-glass (100 micron thick) compared to standard soda lime glass. ITO on Ce-glass exhibited pronounced compressive strain because of higher oxygen vacancy concentrations, reduced transparency and charge carrier concentration (10^19 cm-3) resulting from altered stoichiometry. Electrical analysis showed increased Hall mobility (66 cm2V-1s-1) but decreased conductivity due to excess tin incorporation. These specific ITO features originated from inelastic collisions with the substrate during deposition. Variations in wettability and surface potential underscore substrate-induced differences critical for developing optimized ITO coatings for space-grade photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>A first-principles study on the early-stage corrosion of a NiWNb alloy in a chloride salt environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a representative nickel superalloy, Ni70W20Nb10, was investigated in the presence of chlorine to quantify its early-stage dissolution behavior. Surface structures were generated from a bulk configuration sampled in equilibrium using a multi-cell Monte Carlo method for phase prediction. The predicted solid-phase at 800 C was Ni72W19Nb9 in a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure closely resembling the Ni4W structure. Chlorine adsorption onto the energetically favored (110) surface showed preference to niobium which acted as a trapping sink on the top surface of the slab model. Our findings suggested that niobium and tungsten enhanced the corrosion resistance of nickel as their presence created regions that were thermodynamically preferred by the incoming chlorine and less susceptible to chlorine-facilitated dissolution from the alloy. Nickel, niobium, and tungsten resisted chlorine-induced dissolution from the surface model up to a 1/3 monolayer coverage of chlorine indicating that all constituents of this alloy possessed superior resistance to localized surface degradation such as corrosive pitting. Further analysis and comparisons between the corrosion resistance of the three metallic species was performed. This work may provide insights that aid in the development of improved structural materials for molten salt reactors.</description>

      <title>On the adsorption of oxygen to high entropy alloy surfaces up to 2ML coverage using Density Functional Theory and Monte Carlo calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance our understanding of oxidation in high-entropy alloys, the early stages of oxidation on the surface of Al10Nb15Ta5Ti30Zr40 were studied using density functional theory and thermodynamic modeling. Surface slabs were generated from bulk configurations sampled from equilibrium using a multicell Monte Carlo method for phase prediction. The bulk structure was found to be a single BCC phase in good agreement with experimental observations. The oxygen adsorbed with a strong preference for sites with Ti and Zr and avoided sites with Nb-Al and Nb-Ta. The surface was shown to be highly reactive to oxygen, yielding a dominating oxygen coverage of two monolayers over the temperature range of 100 to 2600 K and an oxygen pressure range of 10-30 to 105 bar. Inward oxygen diffusion at low coverage was preferred in regions rich with Zr but slowed with the addition of Ti and Al. Diffusion rates drastically decreased at 1 ML, especially in the region rich with Ti and Zr, where strong metal-oxygen bonds were reported. Our results indicated that a high content of Ti and Zr increased the reactivity of the HEA surface to oxygen. The presence of Nb also enhanced the resistance to oxygen adsorption, especially when partnered with Al and Ta. Inward oxygen diffusion was likely to occur at low coverage in regions rich with Zr but could be protected against with the addition of Al and Ti. The limitations of the present work are discussed. This study may provide insights that assist with devising short- and long-term mitigation strategies against material degradation related to high-temperature oxidation.</description>

Abstract: The increasing demand for materials capable of withstanding high temperatures and harsh environments necessitates the discovery of advanced alloys. This study introduces a computational routine to predict solid-state phase stability and calculates elastic constants to determine high temperature viability. With it, machine learning models were trained on 1,014 Mo-Re-W structures to enable a large compilation of elastic and thermal properties over the complete Mo-Re-W compositional domain with extreme resolution. A series of heat maps spanning the full compositional domain were generated to visually present the impact of alloy constituents on the alloy properties. Our findings identified a balanced (Mo,W) + Re blend as a promising composition for high temperature applications, attributed to a strong and stable (Mo,W) matrix with high Re content and the formation of strengthening (W,Re) precipitates that enhanced mechanical performance at 1600oC. Several Mo-Re-W compositions were manufactured to experimentally validate the computational predictions. This approach provides an efficient and system-agnostic pathway for designing and optimizing alloys for high-temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Energy-Resolved EBSD using a Monolithic Direct Electron Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of the energy distribution of backscattered electrons (BSEs) contributing to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns remains as an active challenge. This study introduces an energy-resolved EBSD methodology based on a monolithic active pixel sensor direct electron detector and an electron-counting algorithm to enable the energy quantification of individual BSEs, providing direct measurements of electron energy spectra within diffraction patterns. Following detector calibration of the detector signal as a function of primary beam energy, measurements using a 12 keV primary beam on Si(100) reveal a broad BSE energy distribution across the diffraction pattern, extending down to 3 keV. Furthermore, an angular dependence in the weighted average BSE energy is observed, closely matching predictions from Monte Carlo simulations. Pixel-resolved energy maps reveal subtle modulations at Kikuchi band edges, offering insights into the backscattering process. By applying energy filtering within spectral windows as narrow as 2 keV centered on the primary beam energy, significant enhancement in pattern clarity and high-frequency detail is observed. Notably, electrons in the 2--8 keV range, despite having undergone substantial energy loss ({\Delta}E = 4--10 keV), still produce Kikuchi patterns. By enabling energy determination at the single-electron level, this approach introduces a versatile tool-set for expanding the quantitative capabilities of EBSD, thereby offering the potential to deepen the understanding of diffraction contrast mechanisms and to advance the precision of crystallographic measurements.</description>

      <title>Cluster dynamics modeling of hydrogen saturation retention in tungsten with a universal trapping-site sink strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen isotope (HI) retention poses a key issue for tungsten (W)-based plasma-facing materials (PFMs) in fusion devices, where microstructures such as dislocations (DLs) and grain boundaries (GBs) play a dominant role. Existing theoretical sink strength models for microstructures like DLs and GBs fail to account for the observed saturation of HI retention. In this study, we propose a novel universal trapping-site model that dynamically represents sink strengths as time-dependent site concentrations, which is incorporated into an improved cluster dynamics model for high-fluence HI irradiation. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the saturated low-energy deuterium (D) retention and depth profiles in W, in good agreement with experiments. A critical saturation fluence of approximately 1023 m-2 is identified, below which unsaturated D retention is governed by both GBs and ion-induced defects, whereas above this threshold GBs dominate D retention by trapping free D and approaching their theoretical saturation limit. The trapping-site sink strength model enables quantification of H trapping by diverse microstructures via unified effective site concentrations, providing mechanistic insights into microstructural effects and facilitating direct evaluation of HI retention in PFMs under different irradiation conditions.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Neutron Scattering for Direct Detection of Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral phonons have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in spintronics, superconductivity, and advanced materials, but their detection has predominantly relied on indirect photon-involved processes. Here, we propose inelastic neutron scattering (INS) as a direct and versatile approach for chiral phonon detection over a broad momentum-energy space. Leveraging INS sensitivity to phonon eigenmodes, we clearly distinguish linear, elliptical, and chiral phonons and determine phonon handedness through angle-resolved measurements. Using right-handed tellurium (Te) as a model system, we identify characteristic INS fingerprints that clearly separate chiral from linear phonons. Moreover, we show that INS can directly access phonon magnetic moments and the effective magnetic fields generated by chiral phonons, as evidenced by the pronounced mode splitting in CeF$_3$. Collectively, these results position INS as a powerful platform for comprehensive investigations of chiral-phonon dynamics and their associated quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Knot-Driven Spin Selectivity: Topological Chirality-Induced Robust Spin Polarization in Molecular Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to traditional structural chiral materials (e.g., DNA, helicene), topological chirality in trefoil knot molecules has demonstrated multiple remarkable advantages in chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), including ultra-high spin polarization of nearly 90%, conductivity increased by two orders of magnitude, and high-temperature stability (up to 350$^{\circ}$C). However, the underlying physical mechanism remains elusive. This work establishes, for the first time, a fundamental theoretical framework for topological chirality-induced spin selectivity (TCISS) in trefoil knot molecules and identifies the necessary conditions for knot-driven spin selectivity. Our calculation results reveal that a trefoil knot molecule can exhibit spin polarization exceeding 60% along with significant conductivity. Notably, neither reducing the lattice number nor applying strain regulation significantly diminishes this ultra-high spin polarization, highlighting its robustness. Importantly, when the topological knot degenerates into a trivial structure, accompanied by the transition from topological chirality to structural chirality, the spin polarization sharply declines, demonstrating a strong correlation between the ultrahigh spin polarization and the knot topology. Our theory not only successfully elucidates the physical mechanism of TCISS, but also uncovers a new spin-polarized transport phenomenon termed knot-driven spin selectivity, offering new guiding principles for designing nonmagnetic materials for spintronics device applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging of Ferromagnetic van der Waals Magnetic Domain Structures at Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered 2D van der Waals magnetic materials, and specifically Iron-Germanium-Telluride ($\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$), have attracted significant attention both from a fundamental perspective and for potential applications. Key open questions concern their domain structure and magnetic phase transition temperature as a function of sample thickness and external field, as well as implications for integration into devices such as magnetic memories and logic. Here we address key questions using a nitrogen-vacancy center based quantum magnetic microscope, enabling direct imaging of the magnetization of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ at sub-micron spatial resolution as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and thickness. We employ spatially resolved measures, including magnetization variance and cross-correlation, and find a significant spread in transition temperature yet with no clear dependence on thickness down to 15 nm. We also identify previously unknown stripe features in the optical as well as magnetic images, which we attribute to modulations of the constituting elements during crystal synthesis and subsequent oxidation. Our results suggest that the magnetic anisotropy in this material does not play a crucial role in their magnetic properties, leading to a magnetic phase transition of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ which is largely thickness-independent down to 15 nm. Our findings could be significant in designing future spintronic devices, magnetic memories and logic with 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Type-II Antiferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferroelectricity (AFE) is a fundamental concept in physics and materials science. Conventional AFEs have the picture of alternating local electric dipoles defined in real space. Here, we discover a new class of AFEs, termed type-II AFEs, which possess opposite polarizations defined in momentum space across a pair of symmetry decoupled subspaces. Unlike conventional AFEs, the order parameter of type-II AFEs is rigorously formulated through Berry-phase theory and can be quantitatively extracted from the electronic band structure. Focusing on a subclass of type-II AFEs that preserve spin-rotation symmetry, we establish the relevant symmetry constraints and identify all compatible spin point groups. Remarkably, we find that type-II AFE order intrinsically coexists with antiferromagnetism, revealing a robust form of magnetoelectric coupling. We construct an altermagnetic model and identify several concrete antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic materials, such as FeS, Cr2O3, MgMnO3, monolayer MoICl2 and bilayer CrI3, that exhibit this novel ordering. Furthermore, we uncover unique physical phenomena associated with type-II spin-AFE systems, including spin current generation upon AFE switching and localized spin polarization at boundaries and domain walls. Our findings reveal a previously hidden class of quantum materials with intertwined ferroic orders, offering exciting opportunities for both fundamental exploration and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Adjudicating Conduction Mechanisms in High Performance Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.</description>

      <title>Revealing Atomic-Scale Switching Pathways in van der Waals Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials hold the potential for ultra-scaled ferroelectric (FE) devices due to their silicon compatibility and robust polarization down to atomic scale. However, the inherently weak vdW interactions enable facile sliding between layers, introducing complexities beyond those encountered in conventional ferroelectric materials and presenting significant challenges in uncovering intricate switching pathways. Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in-situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group-IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90 degrees switching pathway and a direct 180 degrees switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: Controlling the microstructure of a diffusion welded interface is a critical point to ensure optimum mechanical properties and the homogeneity of the joint. Beyond the intimate contact formation between bonded parts studied in the literature, this article focuses on the grain boundary crossing of the interface during this process and its measurement. Following this perspective, a Level-Set method has been used for full-field microstructure simulations in 2D with various interface parameters. Two crossing measurement models have been formulated, tested and discussed over the simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness and robustness of deep learning models remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications. In this study, we present a framework called attention-guided training that combines explainable artificial intelligence techniques with quantitative evaluation and domain-specific priors to guide model attention. We demonstrate that domain specific feedback on model explanations during training can enhance the model's generalization capabilities. We validate our approach on the task of semantic crack tip segmentation in digital image correlation data which is a key application in the fracture mechanical characterization of materials. By aligning model attention with physically meaningful stress fields, such as those described by Williams' analytical solution, attention-guided training ensures that the model focuses on physically relevant regions. This finally leads to improved generalization and more faithful explanations.</description>

      <title>Sliding Engineering Spin-Valley-Layer Coupling and Altermagnetism in Bilayer Antiferromagnetic Honeycomb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy alloys gained significant scientific interest in recent years due to their enhanced mechanical properties including high yield strength combined with outstanding ductility. The strength of these materials originates from their highly heterogeneous pinning stress fields that hinder dislocation glide, that is, plastic deformation. This work investigates how the correlations and the anisotropy of the pinning stresses, and the long-range nature and the anisotropy of dislocation interactions influence the propagation of dislocations and the depinning transition in these alloys. Furthermore, it is studied how the impact of these factors manifest in the shape of dislocations. The implications to the wider scope of generic disordered systems and to possible experimental applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Odd-parity Magnetism in Conventional Collinear Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have drawn growing attention on non-relativistic odd-parity magnetism in the wake of altermagnets. Nevertheless, odd-parity spin splitting is often believed to appear in non-collinear magnetic configurations. Here, using symmetry arguments and effective model analysis, we show that Floquet engineering offers a universal strategy for achieving odd-parity magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) collinear antiferromagnets under irradiation of periodic driving light fields such as circularly polarized light, elliptically polarized light, and bicircular light. A comprehensive classification of potential candidates for collinear monolayer or bilayer antiferromagnets is established. Strikingly, the light-induced odd-parity spin splitting can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the crystalline symmetry or the polarization state of incident light, enabling the reversal or conversion of spin-splitting. By combining first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we present illustrative examples of 2D collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials to verify the light-induced odd-parity magnetism. Our work not only offers a powerful approach for uniquely achieving odd-parity spin-splitting with high tunability, but also expands the potential of Floquet engineering in designing unconventional compensated magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use density functional theory calculations to study simple but diverse stoichiometries within the novel chemical capacitor (CC) setup. We look at main effects occurring in this device, extremes of the physicochemical properties, and we study limits of applicability of this nano-object. In the cases studied, CC permits achieving charge transfer of up to 1.74 e per atom. Tuning of the charge transfer may be achieved via judicious choice of chemical constituents of the CC as well as use of a ferroelectric material as a separator layer. Different classes of chemical systems may be doped, including metallic and nonmetallic elements, and chemical compounds, in certain cases leading to the appearance of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>First principles study of [111]-oriented epitaxially strained Rare-Earth Nickelate NdNiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory is used to investigate the effect of biaxial strain on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of [111]-oriented NdNiO$_3$, as a representative of the rare-earth perovskites that undergo metal-to-insulator transitions. We find that this constraint on the system induces unique structural phase transitions not previously observed under the well-studied bulk or [001]-oriented strained systems. We also report unique electronic behaviour, including amplification of the electronic band-gap with tensile strain, and insulating, charge-ordered phases with non-orthorhombic tilt patterns. To provide clarity to the trends we observe, we also investigate the coupling between the breathing mode and strain, where we observe certain strains to directly favour and disfavour the creation of the breathing mode (and thus the associated charge-ordering). The amplification of the band gap with strain is understood in terms of a cooperative coupling between the elastic constraint and octahedral breathing, which expands on the previously reported triggered mechanism mediated by octahedral tilting.</description>

      <title>Defect migration in supercrystalline nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) are nanostructured hybrid materials with unique emergent functional properties. Given their periodically arranged building blocks, they also offer interesting parallelisms with crystalline materials. They can be processed in multiple forms and at different scales, and crosslinking their organic ligands via heat treatment leads to a remarkable boost of their mechanical properties. This study shows, via X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission (STEM) electron microscopy analyses, how each of these processing steps plays a distinct role in the generation, migration, interaction and healing of supercrystalline defects. Pressing of SCNCs into bulk pellets leads to a distortion of the otherwise fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles (SPs) with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Interestingly, heat treatment at the same temperatures as those applied for the organic crosslinking has significant effects on planar defects. Stacking faults migrate and get healed, as also confirmed via molecular dynamics simulations, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries undergo structural changes. These rearrangements of defects at the supercrystalline scale (tens of nm) in nanocomposites with such remarkable mechanical properties (compressive strength of 100-500 MPa) provide new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered assemblies of functionalized nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Predicting the Enthalpy of Mixing inBinary Liquids Based on Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is an important property for predicting phase formation in alloys. It can be estimated in a large compositional space from pair wise interactions between elements, for which machine learning has recently provided the most accurate predictions. Further improvements requires acquiring high quality data in liquids where models are poorly constrained. In this study, we propose an active learning approach to identify in which liquids additional data are most needed to improve an initial dataset that covers over 400 binary liquids. We identify a critical need for new data on liquids containing refractory elements, which we address by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for 29 equimolar alloys of Ir, Os, Re and W. This enables more accurate predictions of the enthalpy of mixing, and we discuss the trends obtained for refractory elements of period 6. We use clustering analysis to interpret the results of active learning and to explore how our features can be linked to Miedema's semi empirical theory.</description>

      <title>MatSSL: Robust Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Metallographic Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data, most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective. MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40% improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.</description>

      <title>Graph Learning Metallic Glass Discovery from Wikipedia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design. Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and beyond with artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupled Langevin dynamics for Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations are widely used to study spin dynamics in Mott insulators. However, because energy dissipation is typically introduced phenomenologically, its validity for describing nonequilibrium processes and long-time dynamics in real materials remains questionable. In this paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first principles for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our approach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh contour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations through interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise. We benchmark our theoretical framework by numerically integrating the equations of motion for a two-orbital spin chain coupled to Einstein phonons. The resulting energy relaxation mimics realistic cooling dynamics, exhibits nontrivial transient behavior during thermalization, and accurately reproduces thermodynamic properties upon equilibration. This demonstrates the robustness and reliability of our formalism for capturing both equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of dissipative spin dynamics in strongly correlated systems. We further show how electron-phonon coupling induces hybridization between electronic and phononic modes in the excitation spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate how the conventional LLG equations can be recovered as a limiting case of our microscopic theory, and discuss their applicability to real materials.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis and lifetime prediction of adhesive lap joints in contact with aggressive environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a multiscale model of adhesive layers undergoing impurity-dependent cohesive fracture. The model contemplates three scales: i) at the atomic scale, fracture is controlled by interatomic separation and the thermodynamics of separation depends on temperature and impurity concentration; ii) the mesoscale is characterized by the collective response of a large number of interatomic planes across the adhesive layer, resulting in a thickness-dependence strength; in addition, impurities are uptaken from the environment and diffuse through the adhesive layer; and iii) at the macroscale, we focus on lap joints under the action of static loads and aggressive environments. Within this scenario, we obtain closed form analytical solutions for: the dependence of the adhesive layer strength on thickness; the length of the edge cracks, if any, as a function of time; the lifetime of the joint; and the dependence of the strength of the joint on time of preexposure to the environment. Overall, the theory is found to capture well the experimentally observed trends. Finally, we discuss how the model can be characterized on the basis of atomistic calculations, which opens the way for the systematic exploration of new material specifications.</description>

      <title>On-chip Single-crystal Plasmonic Optoelectronics for Efficient Hot Carrier Collection and Photovoltage Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-area chemically synthesized single-crystal metals with nanometer-scale thickness have emerged as promising materials for on-chip nanophotonic applications, owing to their superior plasmonic properties compared to nanofabricated polycrystalline counterparts. While much recent attention has focused on their optical properties, the combined optimal electrical and optical characteristics, which hold great potential for high-performance optoelectronic functionalities, remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a single-crystal plasmonic optoelectronic platform based on nanowires fabricated from synthesized gold flakes and demonstrate its capabilities for highly enhanced hot carrier collection, electroluminescence, and photovoltage detection. Notably, single-crystal gold nanogap devices exhibit an order of magnitude higher open-circuit photovoltage compared to polycrystalline devices, representing one of the highest reported photovoltage sensing performances in terms of on-chip device density and responsivity per area. Our analysis revealed that this enhancement is attributed mostly to the suppression of electron-phonon scattering and improved hot carrier tunneling efficiency in single-crystal devices. These results highlight the potential of large-scale single-crystal nanostructures for both fundamental studies of nanoscale hot carrier transport and scalable electrically driven nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the time dependent Maxwell system in the sense of distributions in the context of temporal interfaces. Just as with spatial interfaces, electromagnetic waves at temporal interfaces scatter and create a transmitted and reflected wave. We provide a rigorous derivation of boundary conditions for the electric and magnetic fields at temporal interfaces with precise assumptions on the material parameters. In turn, we use this to obtain a general Snell's Law at such interfaces. From this, we obtain explicit formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients. Unlike previous works, we do not make any simplifying ansatz on the solution to the Maxwell system, nor do we assume that the fields are smooth. We also consider material parameters which are not necessarily constant on either side of the temporal interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Poisson/drift-diffusion model that includes valley scattering effects for simulating valley photovoltaic devices. The valley photovoltaic concept is a novel implementation of a hot-carrier solar cell and leverages the valley scattering effect under large electric field to potentially achieve high voltage and high efficiency. Fabricated devices have shown S-shaped current-voltage curves, low fill factor, and thus low efficiency. We hence develop the first device model for valley photovoltaics. Our model includes electric-field-dependent valley scattering rates extracted from previous ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the condition of nonequilibrium carrier populations in the satellite valleys is not enough for valley photovoltaics to achieve high efficiency. We also show that increasing the built-in electric field of the valley-scattering region does not improve efficiency, contrary to previous suggestion.</description>

      <title>Poliazed Houston State Framework for Nonequilibrium Driven Open Quanum Sysmtes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework -- the polarized Houston basis -- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of metasurfaces can be intentionally engineered by carefully designing their unit cells. Narrowband metasurfaces, characterized by high quality factors, can serve as an efficient platform for biosensing in optical to THz regimes, to explore new structural forms of biomolecules, further elevating the capabilities of THz sensing technologies. In this study, an all-metallic metasurface featuring structural asymmetry is proposed to analyze L-Cysteine with orthorhombic and monoclinic crystallographic structures. The influence of the concentration of L-Cysteine in the monoclinic phase on the THz response of the metasurface was performed using a drop-casting method. Our findings reveal a noticeable frequency shift as analyte concentration raises, underscoring the potential for high sensitivity in detecting biomolecules. Thus, this research demonstrates that asymmetric THz metasurfaces offer rather promising detection capabilities at lower THz frequencies between two crystallographic structures of L Cysteine, with a Q-factor of 37, and a sensitivity of 1.430 THz ml/g. We believe that our results can be of great value to the development of biosensors for improved material characterization at low frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Single photons source (SPS) is a key component required by quantum communication devices. We report the finding of bright diamond-based SPS created by nature millions of years ago. It is shown that narrow ($\leq$ 2 nm) lines observed within the 500-800 nm range in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the surface layer of untreated Yakut diamonds rich in nitrogen and hydrogen belong to SPS. Moreover, unknown narrow-line PL observed earlier in nitrogen- and hydrogen-rich diamonds from various deposits around the world are thought to be associated with SPS. Thus, the diamond rim, which until now was sent to the dumps or, at best, used as an abrasive powder, turned out to be a valuable material suitable for use in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Predicting Chemically Accurate Adsorption Energy Using an Interpretable Deep Learning Model Pretrained by GGA Calculation Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular adsorption energy is a critical descriptor for high-throughput screening of heterogeneous catalysts and electrode materials. However, precise experimental adsorption energies are scarce due to the complexity of experiments, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative, but face challenges such as functional dependency, limited labeled high-fidelity data, and interpretability issues. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption (DOTA), a novel deep learning model that leverages local density of states (LDOS) as input to predict chemically accurate adsorption energies across metallic and intermetallic surfaces. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture orbital interaction patterns, achieving superior accuracy and transferability. Pretrained on PBE-level DFT data, DOTA can be fine-tuned using minimal high-fidelity experimental or hybrid functional data to predict adsorption energies with chemical accuracy. The model resolves long-standing challenges, such as the "CO puzzle" and outperforms traditional theories, like the d-band center and Fermi softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental approaches.</description>

      <title>Evaluating First-Principles Electron-Phonon Couplings: Consistency Across Methods and Implementations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is fundamental for understanding the behavior of molecules and crystals, influencing phenomena such as charge transport, energy transfer, phase transitions, and polaron formation. Accurate computational methods to calculate EPCs from first principles are essential, but their complexity has resulted in a variety of computational strategies, raising concerns about their mutual consistency.
  In this study, we provide a systematic benchmark of methods for EPC calculation by comparing two fundamentally different {\it ab initio} methodologies. We investigate Gaussian-type orbital methods based on the \textsc{CP2K} code and plane-wave-based projector-augmented-wave (PAW) methods combined with maximally localized Wannier functions, as implemented in \textsc{VASP} and \textsc{wannier90}. In addition, we further distinguish between the derivative--of--Hamiltonian ($dH$) and derivative--of--states ($d\psi$) approaches for obtaining EPC parameters. The comparison is conducted on a representative set of organic molecules, including pyrazine, pyridine, bithiophene, and quarterthiophene, varying significantly in size and flexibility.
  We find excellent agreement across implementations and basis sets when employing the same computational approach ($dH$ or $d\psi$), demonstrating robust consistency between the numerical schemes. However, noticeable deviations occur when comparing the $dH$ and $d\psi$ approaches within each code and for specific cases discussed in detail. Our findings emphasize the reliability of EPC computations using the $dH$ method and caution against potential pitfalls associated with the $d\psi$ approach, providing guidance for future EPC calculations and model parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Effects of Ill-Defined Domain of Definitions of the Parameter Operator on Berry Curvature and the Adiabatic Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analytical study that extends the conventional formulation of Berry curvature, highlighting its derivation in the context of problematic domains of definition of the operators. Our analysis reveals that handling these domains carefully can have a substantial impact on Berry curvature, demonstrating that even Hamiltonians without explicit parameter dependence may exhibit nonzero Berry curvature. This finding emphasizes that Berry curvature is intrinsically related to the eigenvectors rather than the Hamiltonian itself. Our approach utilizes the standard Bloch (k-space) framework for spatially periodic systems, illustrating these effects from first principles and discussing potential implications for solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Fourth-order quantum master equations reveal that spin-phonon decoherence undercuts long magnetization relaxation times in single-molecule magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-phonon interaction is known to drive magnetic relaxation in solid-state systems, but little evidence is available on how it affects coherence time. Here we extend fourth-order quantum master equations to account for coherence terms and describe the full effect of up to two-phonon processes on spin dynamics. We numerically implement this method fully ab initio for a single-molecule magnet with large magnetization blocking temperature and show that while strong axial magnetic anisotropy ensures slow magnetic relaxation approaching seconds at 77 K, the superposition of Kramers doublets is coherent for less than 10 ns due to a novel two-phonon pure dephasing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning of hyperbolic shear polaritons in monoclinic gallium oxide via isotopic substitution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polaritons - hybridized modes arising from the ultrastrong coupling of infrared light to strongly anisotropic lattice vibrations in uniaxial or biaxial polar crystals - enable to confine light to the nanoscale with low losses and high directionality. In even lower symmetry materials, such as monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ (bGO), hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs) further enhance the directionality. Yet, HShPs are intrinsically supported only within narrow frequency ranges defined by the phonon frequencies of the host material. Here, we report spectral tuning of HShPs in bGO by isotopic substitution. Employing near-field optical microscopy to image HShPs in $^{18}$O bGO films homo-epitaxially grown on a $^{16}$O bGO substrate, we demonstrate a spectral redshift of $\sim~40~$cm$^{-1}$ for the $^{18}$O bGO, compared to $^{16}$O bGO. The technique allows for direct observation and a model-free estimation of the spectral shift driven by isotopic substitution without the need for knowledge of the dielectric tensor. Complementary far-field measurements and ab initio calculations - in good agreement with the near-field data - confirm the effectiveness of this estimation. This multifaceted study demonstrates a significant isotopic substitution induced spectral tuning of HShPs into a previously inaccessible frequency range, creating new avenues for technological applications of such highly directional polaritons.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Precision Ceiling in Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Hybrid Fourier-Neural Architecture for Ultra-High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2 error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and \(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery: exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing global challenge, with millions of functional components discarded due to the difficulty of repair and reuse. Traditional circuit assembly relies on soldering, which creates semi-permanent bonds that limit component recovery and contribute to unnecessary waste. We introduce ProForm, a thermoforming approach for solder-free circuit prototyping. By encapsulating electronic components with pressure-formed thermoplastics, ProForm enables secure, reversible mounting without the need for solder or custom mechanical housings. This approach supports a wide range of substrates, including flexible, paper-based, and non-planar circuits, facilitating easy reuse, replacement, and rapid prototyping. We demonstrate ProForm's versatility to support prototyping practices. We show that ProFormed circuits exhibit good electrical performance and mechanical stability. While motivated by a need for sustainable electronics practices, ProForm has other significant advantages over traditional soldering.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Irreversible Particle Adsorption to Fluid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic adsorption of colloidal particles at fluid interfaces is essential for applications ranging from emulsion stabilization to interfacial assembly of functional materials. Adsorption dynamics is often described through diffusion-limited models (such as the Ward-Tordai framework) along with assuming dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed and dispersed particles. However, most experiments show that particle adsorption is irreversible, and diffusion-limited models fail as the surface coverage goes beyond the dilute limit where particle crowding limits further adsorption. Here, we present a unified model that captures the transition from diffusion-limited to kinetic-limited regimes by coupling diffusion with a Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA)-based boundary condition that accounts for irreversible adsorption and particle blocking for a spherical droplet. Using both a microtensiometer and pendant drop tensiometry, we measure dynamic interfacial tension changes for 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPM) particles at the toluene/water interface across a range of bulk concentrations, drop sizes, and particle functionalization. Our analysis shows that the adsorption flux becomes increasingly hindered as the surface area fills, in agreement with RSA predictions. Furthermore, we calculate the Thiele modulus as a dimensionless number that quantifies the relative importance of adsorption kinetics to diffusion. We find that above a critical surface coverage, adsorption becomes reaction-limited, marking a transition to kinetically controlled dynamics. This approach provides a predictive framework for particle adsorption at fluid interfaces and highlights the necessity of moving beyond equilibrium diffusion-limited models.</description>

      <title>Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrast transfer mechanisms for electron scattering have been extensively studied in transmission electron microscopy. Here we revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, and consequently identify new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently been shown to demonstrate non-volatile resistive switching (NVRS), offering significant advantages such as high-density integration and low energy consumption due to their atomic-scale thinness. In this study, we focus on the adsorption and desorption of metal adatoms, which can modulate the electrical resistivity by several orders of magnitude. We develop material-based relationships of the adsorption energy with electronic and atomic structure descriptors by examining the effects of various transition-metal adsorbates on the surface of TMDs. Our results reveal that adsorption energies of transition metals exhibit consistent trends across different TMDs (MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$) and can be explained using simple descriptors of the atomic and electronic structure. We propose several models to describe this adsorption process, providing a deeper understanding of a crucial step in the resistive switching mechanism based on formation and dissolution of point defects. Finally, we connect our computed adsorption energies to the switching energy. These findings will help guide rational materials selection for the development of NVRS devices using 2D TMDs.</description>

Abstract: Single-crystalline diamond (SCD) films possess exceptional thermal, chemical, and optical properties, making them ideal for advanced applications. However, achieving uniform film quality via microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) remains challenging due to spatial variations in plasma characteristics. This study systematically examines the influence of microwave power and chamber pressure on the growth of SCD films using CH4/H2 gas mixtures. Under optimized conditions (3,900 W, 120 Torr), the films exhibit low surface roughness (~2.0 nm), a sharp sp3 Raman peak at 1,332.2 cm-1, and no detectable C-H related features, indicating high crystalline purity. Cross-sectional TEM analysis confirms a uniform (100)-oriented single-crystal structure across the entire sample. These findings advance the understanding of the interplay between deposition parameters and film quality, and establish a more robust foundation for optimizing MPCVD processes in large-area, high-purity diamond fabrication.</description>

      <title>Impact of electron beam propagation on high-resolution quantitative chemical analysis of 1 nm-wide GaN/AlGaN quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in high-resolution spectroscopy analyses within the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have paved the way for measuring the concentration of chemical species in crystalline materials at the atomic scale. However, several artifacts complicate the direct interpretation of experimental data. For instance, in the case of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the linear dependency of local x-ray emission on composition is disrupted by channeling effects and cross-talk during electron beam propagation. To address these challenges, it becomes necessary to adopt an approach that combines experimental data with inelastic scattering simulations. This method aims to account for the effects of electron beam propagation on x-ray emission, essentially determining the quantity and the spatial origin of the collected signal. In this publication, we propose to assess the precision and sensitivity limits of this approach in a practical case study involving a focused ion beam (FIB)-prepared III-N multilayers device. The device features nominally pure ~1.5-nm wide GaN quantum wells surrounded by AlGaN barriers containing a low concentration of aluminum (~5 at. %). By employing atomic-scale EDX acquisitions based on the averaging of more than several thousand frames, calibrated $\zeta$-factors combined with a multi-layer x-ray absorption correction model for quantification, and by comparing the x-ray radiation obtained from the quantum well with a reference 10-nm thick structure, we demonstrate that the quantitative impact of beam propagation on chemical composition can be precisely accounted for, resulting in a composition sensitivity at the atomic scale as low as +-0.25 at.%. Finally, practical aspects to achieve this high precision level are discussed, particularly in terms of inelastic multislice simulation, uncertainty determination, and sample quality.</description>

Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest energy density in batteries. However, they still suffer from electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition in metal-anode batteries and provide a scalable, versatile framework for optimizing its chemical parameters. Our approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameter space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. We use this framework to find the optimal cell for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal is necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches for certain measurements. Simultaneous sampling of the lattice across all basis indices also warrants a coherent treatment of phonons, which yields a larger repeating unit in reciprocal space. We thus introduce the concept of the ``interferometric Brillouin zone'', which is closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor. Both effects determine where phonon modes may be observed. Through a rigorous understanding of both, we introduce a new efficient method of simulation of scattering experiments via Spectral Energy Density (SED) and/or Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective vibrational density of states.</description>

Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

However, automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging artefacts - like ring and cupping effects - and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory data to train models for segmentation of in situ synchrotron data, demonstrated through a metal oxide dissolution study. Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves segmentation performance (94.7% IoU) that matches human inter-annotator reliability (94.6% IoU). This indicates the model has reached the practical upper bound for this task, while reducing processing time by 2 orders of magnitude per 3D dataset compared to manual segmentation. The method maintains robust performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, enabling the efficient analysis of the large volumes of time-resolved tomographic data generated in typical in situ experiments across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.</description>

      <title>Accurate Prediction of Tensorial Spectra Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Designing Two-Dimensional Octuple-Atomic-Layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ as Promising Photocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates as photocatalytic materials due to their large surface areas and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically design and screen a series of octuple-atomic-layer M$_2$A$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In; A = Si, Ge, Sn; Z = N, P, As) using first-principles calculations. 108 structures are constructed by intercalation approach, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their thermodynamic and dynamic stability, band gaps, and band edge alignments to assess their potential for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Among them, eight candidates meet the criteria for overall water splitting under acidic condition (pH = 0), and Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$, further exhibit suitable band edge positions for photocatalysis under both acidic and neutral environments (pH = 0 and 7). Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ also show pronounced visible-light absorption and structural stability in aqueous conditions. Importantly, the introduction of N vacancies on the surfaces of Al$_2$Si$_2$N$_4$ and Al$_2$Ge$_2$N$_4$ significantly enhances their catalytic activity for both hydrogen reduction and water oxidation reactions, further supporting their potential as photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Our study provides theoretical insights for the rational design of efficient and stable 2D photocatalysts for overall water splitting.</description>

      <title>Paste extrusion generates a surface lubrication layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense particle-fluid mixtures, or \emph{pastes}, are encountered in the production of various materials, including animal feed, human food, pharmaceuticals, and biomass for bioenergy. The flow behavior of such dense deformable particulate media is poorly understood, as the interplay between applied stresses, particle deformability and interstitial fluids can be very complex. One challenging context is high pressure pipe flow, encountered in extrusion. Despite its widespread use, many questions remain about how during high pressure flow of the paste, the particle-fluid mixture behaves and interacts with boundaries. We show how high pressure paste extrusion induces the formation of a fluid boundary thinner than the particle size. The induced fluid layer emerges from a pressure-induced phase segregation process. The fluid layer is sufficiently thin to affect particle-wall contacts, making the paste friction coefficient tunable. Our results so offer potential pathways for reducing energy consumption and even extrusion product composition and failure.</description>

      <title>Confined density of states, quantum concentration, and electron degeneracy pressure in low-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple derivation of the density of states (DOS) in confined nanomaterials. While previous studies often apply a heuristic $L^{3-d}$ confinement factor to bulk DOS expressions, we show that this factor arises naturally from a consistent quantum-mechanical treatment of quasi-dimensional systems. Using a Fermi gas model, we calculate carrier concentration in across different dimensions and introduce the concept of quantum concentration $n_Q$ as a statistical threshold for quantum confinement effect. We further demonstrate that the electron degeneracy pressure -- scaling with $n^{(d+2)/d}$ -- provides a thermodynamic explanation for carrier enhancement under quantum confinement. Our results clarify the origin of DOS modification and provide insights for low-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: The Fermi surface topology of a triple non-hermitian (NH) Weyl semimetal (WSM) driven by bi-circularly polarized light is presented in this study. A NH WSM in particular has remarkable outlines. Bi-circular light, however, modifies the symmetry features of non-hermitian triple Weyl and causes an unusual new kind of band swapping. We observe swapping between the imaginary bands (with or without exceptional degenaracies), which causes unique Fermi surfaces in the form of double rings and knots. This is something never discussed before phase transition between Weyl and knotted phases. We also discuss the corresponding changes in the Berry curvature as well.</description>

      <title>Non-linear and non-empirical double hybrid density functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nlane) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nlane-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nlane-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through the SIE4x4 benchmark and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</description>

      <title>Strain Effects in a Directly Bonded Diamond-on-Insulator Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. This study investigates strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO$_2$/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of $\approx$0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of $\approx$0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.</description>

      <title>Super Moir\'e Domain Tessellations, Sliding Ferroelectricity and Reconfigurable Quantum Dot Arrays in Twisted Trilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At very small twist angles, bilayer moir\'e systems exhibit characteristic stacking domain patterns, where the moir\'e length scale is determined solely by the twist angle. In contrast, the additional stacking and twisting degrees of freedom in twisted trilayer systems give rise to richer and more intricate domain tessellations. In twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride (TTBN), the interplay between polar and nonpolar domains and their domain walls is shown to result in unconventional responses to external electric fields, including electric-field tunability of the moir\'e-of-moir\'e or super moir\'e pattern - features absent in bilayer counterparts. We demonstrate that at the vertices of super moir\'e domains, TTBN can support arrays of quantum dots hosting localized quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) states with diverse spatial symmetries. Futhermore, we show that the shape of the array and the spacing between the localized QHO states can be dynamically reconfigured by electric fields, enabling facile switching between fully isolated and strongly coupled regimes. The local potentials for the quantum dot state are predicted to be sufficiently deep to support a series of QHO states with nonzero angular momentum. This tunability enables control over the transport of quantum dot states and their inter-dot coupling, facillitating long-range quantum state transfer. Combined with the feasibility of large-scale fabrication of homogeneous twisted trilayer materials, these properties position TTBN as a promising platform for a wide range of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Topotactical Hydrogen Induced Single-Band $d$-wave Superconductivity in La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of tetravalent substituents for trivalent La. Here, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen, which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provide theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle band picture bridging topology and strong correlations across energy scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, primarily hindered by a language mismatch problem. While band topology is naturally formulated within a single-particle band theory, strong correlations typically elude such an effective one-body description. In this work, we bridge this gap leveraging the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) variational embedding framework, which introduces auxiliary quasiparticle degrees of freedom to recover an effective band structure description of strongly correlated systems. This approach enables an interpretable and computationally efficient treatment of correlated topological phases, resulting in energy- and momentum-resolved topological features that are directly comparable with experimental spectra. We exemplify the advantages of this framework through a detailed study of the interacting Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Not only does the gGut description reproduce established results, but it also reveals previously inaccessible aspects: most notably, the emergence of topologically nontrivial Hubbard bands hosting their own edge states, as well as possible ways to manipulate these through a finite magnetization. These results position the gGut framework as a promising tool for the predictive modeling of correlated topological materials.</description>
