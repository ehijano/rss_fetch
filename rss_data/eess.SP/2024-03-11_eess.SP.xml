      <title>Re-thinking Human Activity Recognition with Hierarchy-aware Label Relationship Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been studied for decades, from data collection, learning models, to post-processing and result interpretations. However, the inherent hierarchy in the activities remains relatively under-explored, despite its significant impact on model performance and interpretation. In this paper, we propose H-HAR, by rethinking the HAR tasks from a fresh perspective by delving into their intricate global label relationships. Rather than building multiple classifiers separately for multi-layered activities, we explore the efficacy of a flat model enhanced with graph-based label relationship modeling. Being hierarchy-aware, the graph-based label modeling enhances the fundamental HAR model, by incorporating intricate label relationships into the model. We validate the proposal with a multi-label classifier on complex human activity data. The results highlight the advantages of the proposal, which can be vertically integrated into advanced HAR models to further enhance their performances.</description>

      <title>Comparison of gait phase detection using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human walking is a complex activity with a high level of cooperation and interaction between different systems in the body. Accurate detection of the phases of the gait in real-time is crucial to control lower-limb assistive devices like exoskeletons and prostheses. There are several ways to detect the walking gait phase, ranging from cameras and depth sensors to the sensors attached to the device itself or the human body. Electromyography (EMG) is one of the input methods that has captured lots of attention due to its precision and time delay between neuromuscular activity and muscle movement. This study proposes a few Machine Learning (ML) based models on lower-limb EMG data for human walking. The proposed models are based on Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). The traditional ML models are trained on hand-crafted features or their reduced components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). On the contrary, the DCNN model utilises convolutional layers to extract features from raw data. The results show up to 75% average accuracy for traditional ML models and 79% for Deep Learning (DL) model. The highest achieved accuracy in 50 trials of the training DL model is 89.5%.</description>

      <title>Advanced Millimeter-Wave Radar System for Real-Time Multiple Human Tracking and Fall Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores an indoor system for tracking multiple humans and detecting falls, employing three Millimeter-Wave radars from Texas Instruments placed on x-y-z surfaces. Compared to wearables and camera methods, Millimeter-Wave radar is not plagued by mobility inconvenience, lighting conditions, or privacy issues. We establish a real-time framework to integrate signals received from these radars, allowing us to track the position and body status of human targets non-intrusively. To ensure the overall accuracy of our system, we conduct an initial evaluation of radar characteristics, covering aspects such as resolution, interference between radars, and coverage area. Additionally, we introduce innovative strategies, including Dynamic DBSCAN clustering based on signal energy levels, a probability matrix for enhanced target tracking, target status prediction for fall detection, and a feedback loop for noise reduction. We conduct an extensive evaluation using over 300 minutes of data, which equates to approximately 360,000 frames. Our prototype system exhibits remarkable performance, achieving a precision of 98.9% for tracking a single target and 96.5% and 94.0% for tracking two and three targets in human tracking scenarios, respectively. Moreover, in the field of human fall detection, the system demonstrates a high accuracy of 98.2%, underscoring its effectiveness in distinguishing falls from other statuses.</description>

      <title>Geometric Neural Network based on Phase Space for BCI decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on brain signal analysis is still in its nascent stages compared to their success in fields like Computer Vision, especially in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where the brain activity is decoded to control external devices without requiring muscle control. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely adopted choice for designing BCI systems due to its non-invasive and cost-effective nature and excellent temporal resolution. Still, it comes at the expense of limited training data, poor signal-to-noise, and a large variability across and within-subject recordings. Finally, setting up a BCI system with many electrodes takes a long time, hindering the widespread adoption of reliable DL architectures in BCIs outside research laboratories. To improve adoption, we need to improve user comfort using, for instance, reliable algorithms that operate with few electrodes. \textbf{Approach:} Our research aims to develop a DL algorithm that delivers effective results with a limited number of electrodes. Taking advantage of the Augmented Covariance Method with SPDNet, we propose the SPDNet$_{\psi}$ architecture and analyze its performance and computational impact, as well as the interpretability of the results. The evaluation is conducted on 5-fold cross-validation, using only three electrodes positioned above the Motor Cortex. The methodology was tested on nearly 100 subjects from several open-source datasets using the Mother Of All BCI Benchmark (MOABB) framework. \textbf{Main results:} The results of our SPDNet$_{\psi}$ demonstrate that the augmented approach combined with the SPDNet significantly outperforms all the current state-of-the-art DL architecture in MI decoding. \textbf{Significance:} This new architecture is explainable, with a low number of trainable parameters and a reduced carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Generative Probabilistic Forecasting with Applications in Market Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative probabilistic forecasting approach derived from the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series. Under the paradigm of generative artificial intelligence, the proposed forecasting architecture includes an autoencoder that transforms nonparametric multivariate random processes into canonical innovation sequences, from which future time series samples are generated according to their probability distributions conditioned on past samples. A novel deep-learning algorithm is proposed that constrains the latent process to be an independent and identically distributed sequence with matching autoencoder input-output conditional probability distributions. Asymptotic optimality and structural convergence properties of the proposed generative forecasting approach are established. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for merchant storage participants, {(ii) interregional price spread forecasting for interchange markets,} and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate superior performance against leading traditional and machine learning-based forecasting techniques under both probabilistic and point forecast metrics.</description>

      <title>LEO- and RIS-Empowered User Tracking: A Riemannian Manifold Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently drawn significant attention as two transformative technologies, and the synergy between them emerges as a promising paradigm for providing cross-environment communication and positioning services. This paper investigates an integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless network that leverages LEO satellites and RISs to achieve simultaneous tracking of the 3D position, 3D velocity, and 3D orientation of user equipment (UE). To address inherent challenges including nonlinear observation function, constrained UE state, and unknown observation statistics, we develop a Riemannian manifold-based unscented Kalman filter (UKF) method. This method propagates statistics over nonlinear functions using generated sigma points and maintains state constraints through projection onto the defined manifold space. Additionally, by employing Fisher information matrices (FIMs) of the sigma points, a belief assignment principle is proposed to approximate the unknown observation covariance matrix, thereby ensuring accurate measurement updates in the UKF procedure. Numerical results demonstrate a substantial enhancement in tracking accuracy facilitated by RIS integration, despite urban signal reception challenges from LEO satellites. In addition, extensive simulations underscore the superior performance of the proposed tracking method and FIM-based belief assignment over the adopted benchmarks. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed UKF is verified across various uncertainty levels.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning based acoustic measurement approach for robotic applications on orthopedics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Total Knee Replacement Arthroplasty (TKA), surgical robotics can provide image-guided navigation to fit implants with high precision. Its tracking approach highly relies on inserting bone pins into the bones tracked by the optical tracking system. This is normally done by invasive, radiative manners (implantable markers and CT scans), which introduce unnecessary trauma and prolong the preparation time for patients. To tackle this issue, ultrasound-based bone tracking could offer an alternative. In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning structure to improve the accuracy of bone tracking by an A-mode ultrasound (US). We first obtained a set of ultrasound dataset from the cadaver experiment, where the ground truth locations of bones were calculated using bone pins. These data were used to train the proposed CasAtt-UNet to predict bone location automatically and robustly. The ground truth bone locations and those locations of US were recorded simultaneously. Therefore, we could label bone peaks in the raw US signals. As a result, our method achieved sub millimeter precision across all eight bone areas with the only exception of one channel in the ankle. This method enables the robust measurement of lower extremity bone positions from 1D raw ultrasound signals. It shows great potential to apply A-mode ultrasound in orthopedic surgery from safe, convenient, and efficient perspectives.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Enabled Variational Information Bottleneck for IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the amount of data sensed by user devices may be huge, resulting in the serious network congestion. To solve this problem, intelligent data compression is critical. The variational information bottleneck (VIB) approach, combined with machine learning, can be employed to train the encoder and decoder, so that the required transmission data size can be reduced significantly. However, VIB suffers from the computing burden and network insecurity. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled VIB (BVIB) approach to relieve the computing burden while guaranteeing network security. Extensive simulations conducted by Python and C++ demonstrate that BVIB outperforms VIB by 36%, 22% and 57% in terms of time and CPU cycles cost, mutual information, and accuracy under attack, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sparse Spatial Smoothing: Reduced Complexity and Improved Beamforming Gain via Sparse Sub-Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of single snapshot Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation, which is of great importance in a wide-range of applications including automotive radar. A popular approach to achieving high angular resolution when only one temporal snapshot is available is via subspace methods using spatial smoothing. This involves leveraging spatial shift-invariance in the antenna array geometry, typically a uniform linear array (ULA), to rearrange the single snapshot measurement vector into a spatially smoothed matrix that reveals the signal subspace of interest. However, conventional approaches using spatially shifted ULA sub-arrays can lead to a prohibitively high computational complexity due to the large dimensions of the resulting spatially smoothed matrix. Hence, we propose to instead employ judiciously designed sparse sub-arrays, such as nested arrays, to reduce the computational complexity of spatial smoothing while retaining the aperture and identifiability of conventional ULA-based approaches. Interestingly, this idea also suggests a novel beamforming method which linearly combines multiple spatially smoothed matrices corresponding to different sets of shifts of the sparse (nested) sub-array. This so-called shift-domain beamforming method is demonstrated to boost the effective SNR, and thereby resolution, in a desired angular region of interest, enabling single snapshot low-complexity DOA estimation with identifiability guarantees.</description>

      <title>LiDAR Point Cloud-based Multiple Vehicle Tracking with Probabilistic Measurement-Region Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple extended target tracking (ETT) has attracted increasing interest due to the development of high-precision LiDAR and radar sensors in automotive applications. For LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle tracking, this paper presents a probabilistic measurement-region association (PMRA) ETT model, which can depict the complex measurement distribution by dividing the target extent into different regions. The PMRA model overcomes the drawbacks of previous data-region association (DRA) models by eliminating the approximation error of constrained estimation and using continuous integrals to more reliably calculate the association probabilities. Furthermore, the PMRA model is integrated with the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for tracking multiple vehicles. Simulation results illustrate the superior estimation accuracy of the proposed PMRA-PMBM filter in terms of both positions and extents of the vehicles comparing with PMBM filters using the gamma Gaussian inverse Wishart and DRA implementations.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Joint Near-Field 3D Localization and Synchronization in SISO Multipath Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) show great promise in the realm of 6th generation (6G) wireless systems, particularly in the areas of localization and communication. Their cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency enable the integration of numerous passive and reflective elements, enabling near-field propagation. In this paper, we tackle the challenges of RIS-aided 3D localization and synchronization in multipath environments, focusing on the near-field of mmWave systems. Specifically, our approach involves formulating a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem for the channel parameters. To initiate this process, we leverage a combination of canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) to obtain coarse estimates of the time of arrival (ToA) and angle of departure (AoD) under the far-field approximation. Subsequently, distances are estimated using $l_{1}$-regularization based on a near-field model. Additionally, we introduce a refinement phase employing the spatial alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Finally, a weighted least squares approach is applied to convert channel parameters into position and clock offset estimates. To extend the estimation algorithm to ultra-large (UL) RIS-assisted localization scenarios, it is further enhanced to reduce errors associated with far-field approximations, especially in the presence of significant near-field effects, achieved by narrowing the RIS aperture. Moreover, the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) is derived and the RIS phase shifts are optimized to improve the positioning accuracy. Numerical results affirm the efficacy of the proposed estimation algorithm.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a framework for a class of constant modulus (CM) optimization problems, which covers binary constraints, discrete phase constraints, semi-orthogonal matrix constraints, non-negative semi-orthogonal matrix constraints, and several types of binary assignment constraints. Capitalizing on the basic principles of concave minimization and error bounds, we study a convex-constrained penalized formulation for general CM problems. The advantage of such formulation is that it allows us to leverage non-convex optimization techniques, such as the simple projected gradient method, to build algorithms. As the first part of this study, we explore the theory of this framework. We study conditions under which the formulation provides exact penalization results. We also examine computational aspects relating to the use of the projected gradient method for each type of CM constraint. Our study suggests that the proposed framework has a broad scope of applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this study, a convex-constrained penalized formulation was studied for a class of constant modulus (CM) problems. In particular, the error bound techniques were shown to play a vital role in providing exact penalization results. In this second part of the study, we continue our error bound analysis for the cases of partial permutation matrices, size-constrained assignment matrices and non-negative semi-orthogonal matrices. We develop new error bounds and penalized formulations for these three cases, and the new formulations possess good structures for building computationally efficient algorithms. Moreover, we provide numerical results to demonstrate our framework in a variety of applications such as the densest k-subgraph problem, graph matching, size-constrained clustering, non-negative orthogonal matrix factorization and sparse fair principal component analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer has been proposed as a key technology for the foreseen machine type networks. A main challenge in the research community lies in acquiring a simple yet accurate model to capture the energy harvesting performance. In this work, we focus on a half-wave rectifier and based on circuit analysis we provide the actual output of the circuit which accounts for the memory introduced by the capacitor. The provided expressions are also validated through circuit simulations on ADS. Then, the half-wave rectifier is used as an integrated simultaneous wireless information and power transfer receiver where the circuit's output is used for decoding information based on amplitude modulation. We investigate the bit error rate performance based on two detection schemes: (i) symbol-by-symbol maximum likelihood (ML); and (ii) ML sequence detection (MLSD). We show that the symbol period is critical due to the intersymbol interference induced by circuit. Our results reveal that MLSD is necessary towards improving the error probability and achieving higher data rates.</description>

      <title>Ray Launching-Based Computation of Exact Paths with Noisy Dense Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point clouds have been a recent interest for ray tracing-based radio channel characterization, as sensors such as RGB-D cameras and laser scanners can be utilized to generate an accurate virtual copy of a physical environment. In this paper, a novel ray launching algorithm is presented, which operates directly on noisy point clouds acquired from sensor data. It produces coarse paths that are further refined to exact paths consisting of reflections and diffractions. A commercial ray tracing tool is utilized as the baseline for validating the simulated paths. A significant majority of the baseline paths is found. The robustness to noise is examined by artificially applying noise along the normal vector of each point. It is observed that the proposed method is capable of adapting to noise and finds similar paths compared to the baseline path trajectories with noisy point clouds. This is prevalent especially if the normal vectors of the points are estimated accurately. Lastly, a simulation is performed with a reconstructed point cloud and compared against channel measurements and the baseline paths. The resulting paths demonstrate similarity with the baseline path trajectories and exhibit an analogous pattern to the aggregated impulse response extracted from the measurements.

      <title>UAV-Enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To exploit unprecedented data generation in mobile edge networks, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional centralized machine learning (ML).
  However, there are some critical challenges for FL deployment.
  One major challenge called straggler issue severely limits FL's coverage where the device with the weakest channel condition becomes the bottleneck of the model aggregation performance.
  Besides, the huge uplink communication overhead compromises the effectiveness of FL, which is particularly pronounced in large-scale systems.
  To address the straggler issue, we propose the integration of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the parameter server (UAV-PS) to coordinate the FL implementation.
  We further employ over-the-air computation technique that leverages the superposition property of wireless channels for efficient uplink communication.
  Specifically, in this paper, we develop a novel UAV-enabled over-the-air asynchronous FL (UAV-AFL) framework which supports the UAV-PS in updating the model continuously to enhance the learning performance. Moreover, we conduct a convergence analysis to quantitatively capture the impact of model asynchrony, device selection and communication errors on the UAV-AFL learning performance. Based on this, a unified communication-learning problem is formulated to maximize asymptotical learning performance by optimizing the UAV-PS trajectory, device selection and over-the-air transceiver design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves substantially learning efficiency improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot ECG Classification with Multimodal Learning and Test-time Clinical Knowledge Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are non-invasive diagnostic tools crucial for detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical practice. While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL}) framework. Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE) approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot classification (without training data), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL methods with 10\% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Target Detection in Collocated MIMO Radar with Colored Background Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-bit sampling has emerged as a promising technique in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems due to its ability to significantly reduce data volume and processing requirements. Nevertheless, current detection methods have not adequately addressed the impact of colored noise, which is frequently encountered in real scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel detection method that accounts for colored noise in MIMO radar systems. Specifically, we derive Rao's test by computing the derivative of the likelihood function with respect to the target reflectivity parameter and the Fisher information matrix, resulting in a detector that takes the form of a weighted matched filter. To ensure the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property, we also consider noise covariance uncertainty and examine its effect on the probability of false alarm. The detection probability is also studied analytically. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed detector provides considerable performance gains in the presence of colored noise.</description>

      <title>User Tracking and Direction Estimation Codebook Design for IRS-Assisted mmWave Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future communication systems are envisioned to employ intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band to provide reliable high-rate services. For mobile users, the time-varying channel state information (CSI) requires adequate adjustment of the reflection pattern of the IRS. We propose a novel codebook-based user tracking (UT) algorithm for IRS-assisted mmWave communication, allowing suitable reconfiguration of the IRS unit cell phase shifts, resulting in a high reflection gain. The presented algorithm acquires the direction information of the user based on a peak likelihood-based direction estimation. Using the direction information, the user's trajectory is extrapolated to proactively update the adopted codeword and adjust the IRS phase shift configuration accordingly. Furthermore, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the direction estimation error and utilize the obtained insights to design a codebook specifically optimized for direction estimation. Our numerical results reveal a lower direction estimation error of the proposed UT algorithm when employing our designed codebook compared to codebooks from the literature. Furthermore, the average achieved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as the average effective rate of the proposed UT algorithm are analyzed. The proposed UT algorithm requires only a low overhead for direction and channel estimation and avoids outdated IRS phase shifts. Furthermore, it is shown to outperform two benchmark schemes based on direct phase shift optimization and hierarchical codebook search, respectively, via computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiobject Tracking for Thresholded Cell Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many multiobject tracking applications, including radar and sonar tracking, after prefiltering the received signal, measurement data is typically structured in cells. The cells, e.g., represent different range and bearing values. However, conventional multiobject tracking methods use so-called point measurements. Point measurements are provided by a preprocessing stage that applies a threshold or detector and breaks up the cell's structure by converting cell indexes into, e.g., range and bearing measurements. We here propose a Bayesian multiobject tracking method that processes measurements that have been thresholded but are still cell-structured. We first derive a likelihood function that systematically incorporates an adjustable detection threshold which makes it possible to control the number of cell measurements. We then propose a Poisson Multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter based on the likelihood function for cell measurements. Furthermore, we establish a link to the conventional point measurement model by deriving the likelihood function for point measurements with amplitude information (AM) and discuss the PMB filter that uses point measurements with AM. Our numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method that relies on thresholded cell measurements compared to the conventional multiobject tracking based on point measurements with and without AM.</description>

      <title>Distributed Average Consensus via Noisy and Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air aggregation has attracted widespread attention for its potential advantages in task-oriented applications, such as distributed sensing, learning, and consensus. In this paper, we develop a communication-efficient distributed average consensus protocol by utilizing over-the-air aggregation, which exploits the superposition property of wireless channels rather than combat it. Noisy channels and non-coherent transmission are taken into account, and only half-duplex transceivers are required. We prove that the system can achieve average consensus in mean square and even almost surely under the proposed protocol. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the scenarios with time-varying topology. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.</description>

      <title>Stress Monitoring Using Low-Cost Electroencephalogram Devices: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction. Low-cost health monitoring devices are increasingly being used for mental health related studies including stress. While cortisol response magnitude remains the gold standard indicator for stress assessment, a growing number of studies have started to use low-cost EEG devices as primary recorders of biomarker data.
  Methods. This study reviews published works contributing and/or using EEG devices for detecting stress and their associated machine learning methods. The reviewed works are selected to answer three general research questions and are then synthesized into four categories of stress assessment using EEG, low-cost EEG devices, available datasets for EEG-based stress measurement, and machine learning techniques for EEG-based stress measurement.
  Results. A number of studies were identified where low-cost EEG devices were utilized to record brain function during phases of stress and relaxation. These studies generally reported a high predictive accuracy rate, verified using a number of different machine learning validation methods and statistical approaches. Of these studies, 60% can be considered low-powered studies based on the small number of test subjects used during experimentation.
  Conclusion. Low-cost consumer grade wearable devices including EEG and wrist-based monitors are increasingly being used in stress-related studies. Standardization of EEG signal processing and importance of sensor location still requires further study, and research in this area will continue to provide improvements as more studies become available.</description>

      <title>A Microwave Imaging System for Soil Moisture Estimation in Subsurface Drip Irrigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microwave imaging system(MIS) stands out among prominent imaging tools for capturing images of concealed obstacles. Leveraging its capability to penetrate through heterogeneous environments MIS has been widely used for subsurface imaging. Monitoring subsurface drip irrigation(SDI) as an efficient procedure in agricultural irrigation is essential to maintain the required moisture percentage for plant growth which is a novel MIS application. In this research, we implement a laboratory-scale MIS for SDI reflecting real-world conditions to evaluate leakage localization and quantification in a heterogeneous area. We extract a model to quantify the moisture content by exploiting an imaging approach that could be used in a scheduled SDI. We employ the subspace information of images formed by back projection and Born approximation algorithms for model parametrization and estimate the model parameters using a statistical curve fitting technique. We then compare the performance of these imaging techniques in the presence of environmental clutter such as plant roots and pebbles. The proposed approach can well contribute to efficient mechanistic subsurface irrigation for which the local moisture around the root is obtained noninvasively and remotely with less than 20% estimation error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) enable worldwide network coverage beyond geographical limitations for users to access ubiquitous intelligence services. {\color{black}Facing global coverage and complex environments in SAGINs, edge intelligence can provision AI agents based on large language models (LLMs) for users via edge servers at ground base stations (BSs) or cloud data centers relayed by satellites.} As LLMs with billions of parameters are pre-trained on vast datasets, LLM agents have few-shot learning capabilities, e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for complex tasks, which are challenged by limited resources in SAGINs. In this paper, we propose a joint caching and inference framework for edge intelligence to provision sustainable and ubiquitous LLM agents in SAGINs. We introduce "cached model-as-a-resource" for offering LLMs with limited context windows and propose a novel optimization framework, i.e., joint model caching and inference, to utilize cached model resources for provisioning LLM agent services along with communication, computing, and storage resources. We design "age of thought" (AoT) considering the CoT prompting of LLMs, and propose the least AoT cached model replacement algorithm for optimizing the provisioning cost. We propose a deep Q-network-based modified second-bid (DQMSB) auction to incentivize these network operators, which can enhance allocation efficiency while guaranteeing strategy-proofness and free from adverse selection.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging technologies, such as holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) and stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), are driving the development of wireless communication systems. Specifically, the SIM is physically constructed by stacking multiple layers of metasurfaces and has an architecture similar to an artificial neural network (ANN), which can flexibly manipulate the electromagnetic waves that propagate through it at the speed of light. This architecture enables the SIM to achieve HMIMO precoding and combining in the wave domain, thus significantly reducing the hardware cost and energy consumption. In this letter, we investigate the channel estimation problem in SIM-assisted multi-user HMIMO communication systems. Since the number of antennas at the base station (BS) is much smaller than the number of meta-atoms per layer of the SIM, it is challenging to acquire the channel state information (CSI) in SIM-assisted multi-user systems. To address this issue, we collect multiple copies of the uplink pilot signals that propagate through the SIM. Furthermore, we leverage the array geometry to identify the subspace that spans arbitrary spatial correlation matrices. Based on partial CSI about the channel statistics, a pair of subspace-based channel estimators are proposed. Additionally, we compute the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed channel estimators and optimize the phase shifts of the SIM to minimize the MSE. Numerical results are illustrated to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation schemes.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurface Enabled LEO Satellite Communications Relying on Statistical CSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems have gained increasing attention as a crucial supplement to terrestrial wireless networks due to their extensive coverage area. This letter presents a novel system design for LEO satellite systems by leveraging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) technology. Specifically, the lightweight and energy-efficient SIM is mounted on a satellite to achieve multiuser beamforming directly in the electromagnetic wave domain, which substantially reduces the processing delay and computational load of the satellite compared to the traditional digital beamforming scheme. To overcome the challenges of obtaining instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and maximize the system's performance, a joint power allocation and SIM phase shift optimization problem for maximizing the ergodic sum rate is formulated based on statistical CSI, and an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is customized to solve it efficiently. Additionally, a user grouping method based on channel correlation and an antenna selection algorithm are proposed to further improve the system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SIM-based LEO satellite system design and statistical CSI-based AO algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that ignoring the presence of stochastic disturbances in the identification of stochastic Wiener models leads to asymptotically biased estimators. On the other hand, optimal statistical identification, via likelihood-based methods, is sensitive to the assumptions on the data distribution and is usually based on relatively complex sequential Monte Carlo algorithms. We develop a simple recursive online estimation algorithm based on an output-error predictor, for the identification of continuous-time stochastic parametric Wiener models through stochastic approximation. The method is applicable to generic model parameterizations and, as demonstrated in the numerical simulation examples, it is robust with respect to the assumptions on the spectrum of the disturbance process.</description>

      <title>RadCloud: Real-Time High-Resolution Point Cloud Generation Using Low-Cost Radars for Aerial and Ground Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present RadCloud, a novel real time framework for directly obtaining higher-resolution lidar-like 2D point clouds from low-resolution radar frames on resource-constrained platforms commonly used in unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs and UGVs, respectively); such point clouds can then be used for accurate environmental mapping, navigating unknown environments, and other robotics tasks. While high-resolution sensing using radar data has been previously reported, existing methods cannot be used on most UAVs, which have limited computational power and energy; thus, existing demonstrations focus on offline radar processing. RadCloud overcomes these challenges by using a radar configuration with 1/4th of the range resolution and employing a deep learning model with 2.25x fewer parameters. Additionally, RadCloud utilizes a novel chirp-based approach that makes obtained point clouds resilient to rapid movements (e.g., aggressive turns or spins), which commonly occur during UAV flights. In real-world experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of RadCloud on commercially available UAVs and UGVs, with off-the-shelf radar platforms on-board.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Hybrid Beamforming for Holographic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that there is inherent radiation pattern distortion for the commercial base station antenna array, which usually needs three antenna sectors to cover the whole space. To eliminate pattern distortion and further enhance beamforming performance, we propose an electromagnetic hybrid beamforming (EHB) scheme based on a three-dimensional (3D) superdirective holographic antenna array. Specifically, EHB consists of antenna excitation current vectors (analog beamforming) and digital precoding matrices, where the implementation of analog beamforming involves the real-time adjustment of the radiation pattern to adapt it to the dynamic wireless environment. Meanwhile, the digital beamforming is optimized based on the channel characteristics of analog beamforming to further improve the achievable rate of communication systems. An electromagnetic channel model incorporating array radiation patterns and the mutual coupling effect is also developed to evaluate the benefits of our proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed EHB scheme with a 3D holographic array achieves a relatively flat superdirective beamforming gain and allows for programmable focusing directions throughout the entire spatial domain. Furthermore, they also verify that the proposed scheme achieves a sum rate gain of over 150% compared to traditional beamforming algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique, vital for interference mitigation in modern communication systems. It investigates the use of precoding methods in RSMA, especially in complex multiple-antenna interference channels, employing deep reinforcement learning. The aim is to optimize precoders and power allocation for common and private data streams involving multiple decision-makers. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework is employed to address this complexity, where decentralized agents collectively learn to optimize actions in a continuous policy space. We also explore the challenges posed by imperfect channel side information at the transmitter. Additionally, decoding order estimation is addressed to determine the optimal decoding sequence for common and private data sequences. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RSMA method based on MADDPG, achieving the upper bound in single-antenna scenarios and closely approaching theoretical limits in multi-antenna scenarios. Comparative analysis shows superiority over other techniques such as MADDPG without rate-splitting, maximal ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and leakage-based precoding methods. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning-driven RSMA in reducing interference and enhancing system performance in communication systems.</description>

      <title>Multimodal deep learning approach to predicting neurological recovery from coma after cardiac arrest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work showcases our team's (The BEEGees) contributions to the 2023 George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge. The aim was to predict neurological recovery from coma following cardiac arrest using clinical data and time-series such as multi-channel EEG and ECG signals. Our modelling approach is multimodal, based on two-dimensional spectrogram representations derived from numerous EEG channels, alongside the integration of clinical data and features extracted directly from EEG recordings. Our submitted model achieved a Challenge score of $0.53$ on the hidden test set for predictions made $72$ hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Our study shows the efficacy and limitations of employing transfer learning in medical classification. With regard to prospective implementation, our analysis reveals that the performance of the model is strongly linked to the selection of a decision threshold and exhibits strong variability across data splits.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Absence of spurious solutions far from ground truth: A low-rank analysis with high-order losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix sensing problems exhibit pervasive non-convexity, plaguing optimization with a proliferation of suboptimal spurious solutions. Avoiding convergence to these critical points poses a major challenge. This work provides new theoretical insights that help demystify the intricacies of the non-convex landscape. In this work, we prove that under certain conditions, critical points sufficiently distant from the ground truth matrix exhibit favorable geometry by being strict saddle points rather than troublesome local minima. Moreover, we introduce the notion of higher-order losses for the matrix sensing problem and show that the incorporation of such losses into the objective function amplifies the negative curvature around those distant critical points. This implies that increasing the complexity of the objective function via high-order losses accelerates the escape from such critical points and acts as a desirable alternative to increasing the complexity of the optimization problem via over-parametrization. By elucidating key characteristics of the non-convex optimization landscape, this work makes progress towards a comprehensive framework for tackling broader machine learning objectives plagued by non-convexity.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation Considerate Precoder Design for Multi-user Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems: The Concept and Fast Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) communication networks target peak data rates exceeding 1Tbps, necessitating base stations (BS) to support up to 100 simultaneous data streams. However, sparse pilot allocation to accommodate such streams poses challenges for users' channel estimation. This paper presents Channel Estimation Considerate Precoding (CECP), where BS precoders prioritize facilitating channel estimation alongside maximizing transmission rate. To address the computational complexity of 6G large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, we propose a computationally-efficient space-time block diagonal channel shortening (ST-BDCS) precoding scheme. By leveraging the sparse Toeplitz property of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, this time-domain precoding design effectively mitigates multi-user interference in the downlink and shortens the effective channel's temporal length. Consequently, users can estimate the channels using sparse pilots. To enable fast implementation, we develop a generalized complex-valued Toeplitz matrix QR decomposition algorithm applicable to various space-time signal processing problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the ST-BDCS precoding method approximates the rate performance of conventional subcarrier-by-subcarrier precoding schemes. However, it offers the advantages of easier channel estimation for users and significantly reduced computational complexity for the BS.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Analysis for Distributed RISs-Assisted mmWave Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) has attracted considerable attention due to its wide bandwidth and high frequency. However, it is highly susceptible to blockages, resulting in significant degradation of the coverage and the sum rate. A promising approach is deploying distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which can establish extra communication links. In this paper, we investigate the impact of distributed RISs on the coverage probability and the sum rate in mmWave wireless communication systems. Specifically, we first introduce the system model, which includes the blockage, the RIS and the user distribution models, leveraging the Poisson point process. Then, we define the association criterion and derive the conditional coverage probabilities for the two cases of direct association and reflective association through RISs. Finally, we combine the two cases using Campbell's theorem and the total probability theorem to obtain the closed-form expressions for the ergodic coverage probability and the sum rate. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical approach, demonstrating that the deployment of distributed RISs significantly improves the ergodic coverage probability by 45.4% and the sum rate by over 1.5 times.</description>

      <title>Hashing Beam Training for Near-Field Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the millimeter-wave (mmWave) near-field beam training problem to find the correct beam direction. In order to address the high complexity and low identification accuracy of existing beam training techniques, we propose an efficient hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme for the near-field scenario. Specifically, we first design a set of sparse bases based on the polar domain sparsity of the near-field channel. Then, the random hash functions are chosen to construct the near-field multi-arm beam training codebook. Each multi-arm beam codeword is scanned in a time slot until all the predefined codewords are traversed. Finally, the soft decision and voting methods are applied to distinguish the signal from different base stations and obtain correctly aligned beams. Simulation results show that our proposed near-field HMB training method can reduce the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level, and achieve 96.4% identification accuracy of exhaustive beam training. Moreover, we also verify applicability under the far-field scenario.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation of Convolutional Neural Networks through Feature Map Transformation using Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of reasoning by Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is still challenging due to their perceived black-box nature. Therefore, deploying DNNs in several real-world tasks is restricted by the lack of transparency of these models. We propose a distillation approach by extracting features from the final layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to address insights to its reasoning. The feature maps in the final layer of a CNN are transformed into a one-dimensional feature vector using a fully connected layer. Subsequently, the extracted features are used to train a decision tree to achieve the best accuracy under constraints of depth and nodes. We use the medical images of dermaMNIST, octMNIST, and pneumoniaMNIST from the medical MNIST datasets to demonstrate our proposed work. We observed that performance of the decision tree is as good as a CNN with minimum complexity. The results encourage interpreting decisions made by the CNNs using decision trees.</description>

      <title>Quantized Constant-Envelope Waveform Design for Massive MIMO DFRC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have been recognized as enabling technologies for 6G wireless networks. This paper considers the advanced waveform design for hardware-efficient massive MIMO DFRC systems. Specifically, the transmit waveform is imposed with the quantized constant-envelope (QCE) constraint, which facilitates the employment of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and power-efficient amplifiers. The waveform design problem is formulated as the minimization of the mean square error (MSE) between the designed and desired beampatterns subject to the constructive interference (CI)-based communication quality of service (QoS) constraints and the QCE constraint. To solve the formulated problem, we first utilize the penalty technique to transform the discrete problem into an equivalent continuous penalty model. Then, we propose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) algorithm for solving the penalty model. In particular, the ALM subproblem at each iteration is solved by a custom-built block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm, which admits closed-form updates, making the proposed inexact ALM algorithm computationally efficient. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art ones. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to examine the impact of various system parameters on the trade-off between communication and radar performances.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents further insights into a recently developed round-trip communication scheme called ``Secret-message Transmission by Echoing Encrypted Probes (STEEP)''. A legitimate wireless channel between a multi-antenna user (Alice) and a single-antenna user (Bob) in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper (Eve) is focused on. STEEP does not require full-duplex, channel reciprocity or Eve's channel state information, but is able to yield a positive secrecy rate in bits per channel use between Alice and Bob in every channel coherence period as long as Eve's receive channel is not noiseless. This secrecy rate does not diminish as coherence time increases. Various statistical behaviors of STEEP's secrecy capacity due to random channel fading are also illustrated.</description>

      <title>Spatial features of CO2 for occupancy detection in a naturally ventilated school building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate occupancy information helps to improve building energy efficiency and occupant comfort. Occupancy detection methods based on CO2 sensors have received attention due to their low cost and low intrusiveness. In naturally ventilated buildings, the accuracy of CO2-based occupancy detection is generally low in related studies due to the complex ventilation behavior and the difficulty in measuring the actual air exchange through windows. In this study, we present two novel features for occupancy detection based on the spatial distribution of the CO2 concentration. After a quantitative analysis with Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier, it was found that the accuracy of occupancy state detection in naturally ventilated rooms could be improved by up to 14.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, reaching 83.2 % (F1 score 0.84) without any ventilation information. With ventilation information, the accuracy reached 87.6 % (F1 score 0.89). The performance of occupancy quantity detection was significantly improved by up to 25.3 percentage points versus baseline, reaching 56 %, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.44 occupants, using only CO2-related features. Additional ventilation information further enhanced the performance to 61.8 % (RMSE 9.02 occupants). By incorporating spatial features, the model using only CO2-related features revealed similar performance as the model containing additional ventilation information, resulting in a better low-cost occupancy detection method for naturally ventilated buildings.</description>

      <title>On the Secrecy Rate of In-Band Full-duplex Two-way Wiretap Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a two-way wiretap Multi-Input Multi-Output Multi-antenna Eve (MIMOME) channel, where both nodes (Alice and Bob) transmit and receive in an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) manner. For this system with keyless security, we provide a novel artificial noise (AN) based signal design, where the AN is injected in both signal and null spaces. We present an ergodic secrecy rate approximation to derive the power allocation algorithm. We consider scenarios where AN is known and unknown to legitimate users and include imperfect channel information effects. To maximize secrecy rates subject to the transmit power constraint, a two-step power allocation solution is proposed, where the first step is known at Eve, and the second step helps to improve the secrecy further. We also consider scenarios where partial information is known by Eve and the effects of non-ideal self-interference cancellation. The usefulness and limitations of the resulting power allocation solution are analyzed and verified via simulations. Results show that secrecy rates are less when AN is unknown to receivers or Eve has more information about legitimate users. Since the ergodic approximation only considers Eves distance, the resulting power allocation provides secrecy rates close to the actual ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency sonar systems deployed on a wide array of ocean observing platforms are creating a deluge of water column sonar data at an unprecedented speed from all corners of the ocean. Efficient and integrative analysis of these data, either across different sonar instruments or with other oceanographic datasets, holds the key to monitoring and understanding the response of marine ecosystems to the rapidly changing climate. In this paper we present Echopype, an open-source Python software library designed to address this need. By standardizing water column sonar data from diverse instrument sources following a community convention and utilizing the widely embraced netCDF data model to encode sonar data as labeled, multi-dimensional arrays, Echopype facilitates intuitive, user-friendly exploration and use of sonar data in an instrument-agnostic manner. By leveraging existing open-source Python libraries optimized for distributed computing, Echopype directly enables computational interoperability and scalability in both local and cloud computing environments. Echopype's modularized package structure further provides a conceptually unified implementation framework for expanding its support for additional instrument raw data formats and incorporating new data analysis functionalities. We envision the continued development of Echopype as a catalyst for making information derived from water column sonar data an integrated component of regional and global ocean observation strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a systematic approach for assessing and comparing the computational complexity of neural network layers in digital signal processing. We provide and link four software-to-hardware complexity measures, defining how the different complexity metrics relate to the layers' hyper-parameters. This paper explains how to compute these four metrics for feed-forward and recurrent layers, and defines in which case we ought to use a particular metric depending on whether we characterize a more soft- or hardware-oriented application. One of the four metrics, called `the number of additions and bit shifts (NABS)', is newly introduced for heterogeneous quantization. NABS characterizes the impact of not only the bitwidth used in the operation but also the type of quantization used in the arithmetical operations. We intend this work to serve as a baseline for the different levels (purposes) of complexity estimation related to the neural networks' application in real-time digital signal processing, aiming at unifying the computational complexity estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spatially varying blur kernel $h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})$ is specified by an input coordinate $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and an output coordinate $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$. For computational efficiency, we sometimes write $h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})$ as a linear combination of spatially invariant basis functions. The associated pixelwise coefficients, however, can be indexed by either the input coordinate or the output coordinate. While appearing subtle, the two indexing schemes will lead to two different forms of convolutions known as scattering and gathering, respectively. We discuss the origin of the operations. We discuss conditions under which the two operations are identical. We show that scattering is more suitable for simulating how light propagates and gathering is more suitable for image filtering such as denoising.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided deep learning (DL)-based spectrum sensing for next-generation cognitive radios. To that end, the secondary user (SU) monitors the primary transmitter (PT) signal, where the RIS plays a pivotal role in increasing the strength of the PT signal at the SU. The spectrograms of the synthesized dataset, including the 4G LTE and 5G NR signals, are mapped to images utilized for training the state-of-art object detection approaches, namely Detectron2 and YOLOv7. By conducting extensive experiments using a real RIS prototype, we demonstrate that the RIS can consistently and significantly improve the performance of the DL detectors to identify the PT signal type along with its time and frequency utilization. This study also paves the way for optimizing spectrum utilization through RIS-assisted CR application in next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>SICNN: Soft Interference Cancellation Inspired Neural Network Equalizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years data-driven machine learning approaches have been extensively studied to replace or enhance traditionally model-based processing in digital communication systems. In this work, we focus on equalization and propose a novel neural network (NN-)based approach, referred to as SICNN. SICNN is designed by deep unfolding a model-based iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) method. It eliminates the main disadvantages of its model-based counterpart, which suffers from high computational complexity and performance degradation due to required approximations. We present different variants of SICNN. SICNNv1 is specifically tailored to single carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) systems, the communication system mainly regarded in this work. SICNNv2 is more universal and is applicable as an equalizer in any communication system with a block-based data transmission scheme. Moreover, for both SICNNv1 and SICNNv2, we present versions with highly reduced numbers of learnable parameters. Another contribution of this work is a novel approach for generating training datasets for NN-based equalizers, which significantly improves their performance at high signal-to-noise ratios. We compare the bit error ratio performance of the proposed NN-based equalizers with state-of-the-art model-based and NN-based approaches, highlighting the superiority of SICNNv1 over all other methods for SC-FDE. Exemplarily, to emphasize its universality, SICNNv2 is additionally applied to a unique word orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UW-OFDM) system, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we present a thorough complexity analysis of the proposed NN-based equalization approaches, and we investigate the influence of the training set size on the performance of NN-based equalizers.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is viewed as a crucial component of future mobile networks and has gained much interest in both academia and industry. Similar to the emergence of radio-frequency (RF) ISAC, the integration of free space optical communication and optical sensing yields optical ISAC (O-ISAC), which is regarded as a powerful complement to its RF counterpart. In this article, we first introduce the generalized system structure of O-ISAC, and then elaborate on three advantages of O-ISAC, i.e., increasing communication rate, enhancing sensing precision, and reducing interference. Next, waveform design and resource allocation of O-ISAC are discussed based on pulsed waveform, constant-modulus waveform, and multi-carrier waveform. Furthermore, we put forward future trends and challenges of O-ISAC, which are expected to provide some valuable directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Simplex-structured Matrix Factorization for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Endmember Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a hyperspectral image, the problem of hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is to identify the endmembers (or materials) and the abundance (or endmembers' contributions on pixels) that underlie the image. HU can be seen as a matrix factorization problem with a simplex structure in the abundance matrix factor. In practice, hyperspectral images may exhibit endmember variability (EV) effects -- the endmember matrix factor varies from one pixel to another. In this paper we consider a multilayer simplex-structured matrix factorization model to account for the EV effects. Our multilayer model is based on the postulate that if we arrange the varied endmembers as an expanded endmember matrix, that matrix exhibits a low-rank structure. A variational inference-based maximum-likelihood estimation method is employed to tackle the multilayer factorization problem. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of our multilayer factorization method.</description>

      <title>Guiding Masked Representation Learning to Capture Spatio-Temporal Relationship of Electrocardiogram</title>

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECG) are widely employed as a diagnostic tool for monitoring electrical signals originating from a heart. Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show a spatio-temporal relationship within ECG data. Our code is available at https://github.com/bakqui/ST-MEM.</description>

      <title>DT-DDNN: A Physical Layer Security Attack Detector in 5G RF Domain for CAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) is a fundamental component of the 5G New Radio (NR) air interface, crucial for the initial access procedure of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), and serves several key purposes in the network's operation. However, due to the predictable nature of SSB transmission, including the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), jamming attacks are critical threats. These attacks, which can be executed without requiring high power or complex equipment, pose substantial risks to the 5G network, particularly as a result of the unencrypted transmission of control signals. Leveraging RF domain knowledge, this work presents a novel deep learning-based technique for detecting jammers in CAV networks. Unlike the existing jamming detection algorithms that mostly rely on network parameters, we introduce a double-threshold deep learning jamming detector by focusing on the SSB. The detection method is focused on RF domain features and improves the robustness of the network without requiring integration with the pre-existing network infrastructure. By integrating a preprocessing block to extract PSS correlation and energy per null resource elements (EPNRE) characteristics, our method distinguishes between normal and jammed received signals with high precision. Additionally, by incorporating of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the efficacy of training and detection are optimized. A double-threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) is also introduced to the architecture complemented by a deep cascade learning model to increase the sensitivity of the model to variations of signal-to-jamming noise ratio (SJNR). Results show that the proposed method achieves 96.4% detection rate in extra low jamming power, i.e., SJNR between 15 to 30 dB. Further, performance of DT-DDNN is validated by analyzing real 5G signals obtained from a practical testbed.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based CSI Feedback for RIS-assisted Multi-user Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.03303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communications, efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is paramount. This paper introduces RIS-CoCsiNet, a novel deep learning-based framework designed to greatly enhance feedback efficiency. By leveraging the inherent correlation among proximate user equipments (UEs), our approach strategically categorizes RIS-UE CSI into shared and unique data sets. This nuanced understanding allows for significant reductions in feedback overhead, as the shared data is no longer redundantly relayed. Setting RIS-CoCsiNet apart from traditional autoencoder systems, we incorporate an additional decoder and a combination neural network at the base station. These enhancements are tasked with the precise retrieval and fusion of shared and individual data. And notably, all these innovations are achieved without modifying the UEs. For those UEs boasting multiple antennas, our design seamlessly integrates long short-term memory modules, capturing the intricate correlations between antennas. With a recognition of the non-sparse nature of the RIS-UE CSI phase, we pioneer two magnitude-dependent phase feedback strategies. These strategies adeptly weave in both statistical and real-time CSI magnitude data. The potency of RIS-CoCsiNet is further solidified through compelling simulation results drawn from two diverse channel datasets.</description>

      <title>UL-DL duality for cell-free massive MIMO with per-AP power and information constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06520v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel uplink-downlink duality principle for optimal joint precoding design under per-transmitter power and information constraints in fading channels. The information constraints model limited sharing of channel state information and data bearing signals across the transmitters. The main application is to cell-free networks, where each access point (AP) must typically satisfy an individual power constraint and form its transmit signal using limited cooperation capabilities. Our duality principle applies to ergodic achievable rates given by the popular hardening bound, and it can be interpreted as a nontrivial generalization of a previous result by Yu and Lan for deterministic channels. This generalization allows us to study involved information constraints going beyond the simple case of cluster-wise centralized precoding covered by previous techniques. Specifically, we show that the optimal joint precoders are, in general, given by an extension of the recently developed team minimum mean-square error method. As a particular yet practical example, we then solve the problem of optimal local precoding design in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO networks subject to per-AP power constraints.</description>

      <title>Fairness Scheduling in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a user-centric cell-free massive MIMO wireless network with $L$ remote radio units, each with $M$ antennas, serving $K_{\rm tot}$ user equipments (UEs). Most of the literature considers the regime $LM \gg K_{\rm tot}$, where the $K$ UEs are active on each time-frequency slot, and evaluates the system performance in terms of ergodic rates. In this paper, we take a quite different viewpoint. We observe that the regime of $LM \gg K_{\rm tot}$ corresponds to a lightly loaded system with low sum spectral efficiency (SE). In contrast, in most relevant scenarios, the number of UEs is much larger than the total number of antennas, but users are not all active at the same time. To achieve high sum SE and handle $K_{\rm tot} \gg ML$, users must be scheduled over the time-frequency resource. The number of active users $K_{\rm act} \leq K_{\rm tot}$ must be chosen such that: 1) the network operates close to its maximum SE; 2) the active user set must be chosen dynamically over time in order to enforce fairness in terms of per-user time-averaged throughput rates. The fairness scheduling problem is formulated as the maximization of a concave componentwise non-decreasing network utility function of the per-user rates. Intermittent user activity imposes slot-by-slot coding/decoding which prevents the achievability of ergodic rates. Hence, we model the per-slot service rates using information outage probability. To obtain a tractable problem, we make a decoupling assumption on the CDF of the instantaneous mutual information seen at each UE $k$ receiver. We approximately enforce this condition with a conflict graph that prevents the simultaneous scheduling of users with large pilot contamination and propose an adaptive scheme for instantaneous service rate scheduling. Overall, the proposed dynamic scheduling is robust to system model uncertainties and can be easily implemented in practice.</description>

      <title>Breaking Speaker Recognition with PaddingBack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has gained popularity due to advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, untrusted third-party platforms have raised concerns about AI security, particularly in backdoor attacks. Recent research has shown that speech backdoors can utilize transformations as triggers, similar to image backdoors. However, human ears can easily be aware of these transformations, leading to suspicion. In this paper, we propose PaddingBack, an inaudible backdoor attack that utilizes malicious operations to generate poisoned samples, rendering them indistinguishable from clean ones. Instead of using external perturbations as triggers, we exploit the widely-used speech signal operation, padding, to break speaker recognition systems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a significant attack success rate while retaining benign accuracy. Furthermore, PaddingBack demonstrates the ability to resist defense methods and maintain its stealthiness against human perception.</description>

      <title>Topology Learning for Heterogeneous Decentralized Federated Learning over Unreliable D2D Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of intelligent mobile devices in wireless device-to-device (D2D) networks, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has attracted significant interest. Compared to centralized federated learning (CFL), DFL mitigates the risk of central server failures due to communication bottlenecks. However, DFL faces several challenges, such as the severe heterogeneity of data distributions in diverse environments, and the transmission outages and package errors caused by the adoption of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in D2D networks. These challenges often degrade the convergence of training DFL models. To address these challenges, we conduct a thorough theoretical convergence analysis for DFL and derive a convergence bound. By defining a novel quantity named unreliable links-aware neighborhood discrepancy in this convergence bound, we formulate a tractable optimization objective, and develop a novel Topology Learning method considering the Representation Discrepancy and Unreliable Links in DFL, named ToLRDUL. Intensive experiments under both feature skew and label skew settings have validated the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating improved convergence speed and test accuracy, consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-dense cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology expected to meet the future ubiquitous connectivity requirements and ever-growing data traffic demands in 6G. This article provides a contemporary overview of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO networks, and addresses important unresolved questions on their future deployment. We first present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art research on CF-MMIMO and ultra-dense networks. Then, we discuss the key challenges of CF-MMIMO under ultra-dense scenarios such as low-complexity architecture and processing, low-complexity/scalable resource allocation, fronthaul limitation, massive access, synchronization, and channel acquisition. Finally, we answer key open questions, considering different design comparisons and discussing suitable methods dealing with the key challenges of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO. The discussion aims to provide a valuable roadmap for interesting future research directions in this area, facilitating the development of CF-MMIMO MIMO for 6G.</description>

      <title>Hashing Beam Training for Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In millimeter-wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication networks, users may be within the coverage of multiple access points (AP), which typically employ large-scale antenna arrays to mitigate obstacle occlusion and path loss. However, large-scale arrays generate pencil-shaped beams, which necessitate a higher number of training beams to cover the desired space. Furthermore, as the antenna aperture increases, users are more likely to be situated in the near-field region of the AP antenna array. This motivates our investigation into the near-field beam training problem to achieve effective positioning services. To address the high complexity and low identification accuracy of existing beam training techniques, we propose an efficient hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme for the near-field scenario. Specifically, we first construct a near-field single-beam training codebook for the uniform planar arrays. Then, the hash functions are chosen independently to construct the multi-arm beam training codebooks for each AP. All APs traverse the predefined multi-arm beam training codeword simultaneously and the multi-AP superimposed signals at the user are recorded. Finally, the soft decision and voting methods are applied to obtain the correctly aligned beams only based on the signal powers. In addition, we logically prove that the traversal complexity is at the logarithmic level. Simulation results show that our proposed near-field HMB training method can achieve 96.4% identification accuracy of the exhaustive beam training method and greatly reduce the training overhead. Furthermore, we verify its applicability under the far-field scenario as well.</description>

      <title>Towards a tailored mixed-precision sub-8-bit quantization scheme for Gated Recurrent Units using Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advances in model compression techniques for deep neural networks, deploying such models on ultra-low-power embedded devices still proves challenging. In particular, quantization schemes for Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are difficult to tune due to their dependence on an internal state, preventing them from fully benefiting from sub-8bit quantization. In this work, we propose a modular integer quantization scheme for GRUs where the bit width of each operator can be selected independently. We then employ Genetic Algorithms (GA) to explore the vast search space of possible bit widths, simultaneously optimising for model size and accuracy. We evaluate our methods on four different sequential tasks and demonstrate that mixed-precision solutions exceed homogeneous-precision ones in terms of Pareto efficiency. In our results, we achieve a model size reduction between 25% and 55% while maintaining an accuracy comparable with the 8-bit homogeneous equivalent.</description>

      <title>Towards Bridging the Gap between Near and Far-Field Characterizations of the Wireless Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "near-field" propagation modeling of wireless channels is necessary to support sixth-generation (6G) technologies, such as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), that are enabled by large aperture antennas and higher frequency carriers. As the conventional far-field model proves inadequate in this context, there is a pressing need to explore and bridge the gap between near and far-field propagation models. Although far-field models are simple and provide computationally efficient solutions for many practical applications, near-field models provide the most accurate representation of wireless channels. This paper builds upon the foundations of electromagnetic wave propagation theory to derive near and far-field models as approximations of the Green's function (Maxwell's equations). We characterize the near and far-field models both theoretically and with the help of simulations in a line-of-sight (LOS)-only scenario. In particular, for two key applications in multiantenna systems, namely, beamforming and multiple-access, we showcase the advantages of using the near-field model over the far-field, and present a novel scheduling scheme for multiple-access in the near-field regime. Our findings offer insights into the challenge of incorporating near-field models in practical wireless systems, fostering enhanced performance in future communication technologies.</description>
