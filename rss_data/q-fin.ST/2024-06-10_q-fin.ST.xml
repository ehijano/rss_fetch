      <title>Investigating the price determinants of the European Emission Trading System: a non-parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European carbon market plays a pivotal role in the European Union's ambitious target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Understanding the intricacies of factors influencing European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) market prices is paramount for effective policy making and strategy implementation. We propose the use of the Information Imbalance, a recently introduced non-parametric measure quantifying the degree to which a set of variables is informative with respect to another one, to study the relationships among macroeconomic, economic, uncertainty, and energy variables concerning EU ETS prices. Our analysis shows that in Phase 3 commodity related variables such as the ERIX index are the most informative to explain the behaviour of the EU ETS market price. Transitioning to Phase 4, financial fluctuations take centre stage, with the uncertainty in the EUR/CHF exchange rate emerging as a crucial determinant. These results reflect the disruptive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis in reshaping the importance of the different variables. Beyond variable analysis, we also propose to leverage the Information Imbalance to address the problem of mixed-frequency forecasting, and we identify the weekly time scale as the most informative for predicting the EU ETS price. Finally, we show how the Information Imbalance can be effectively combined with Gaussian Process regression for efficient nowcasting and forecasting using very small sets of highly informative predictors.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Framework for the Modeling of Limit Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing an algebraic framework for modeling limit order books (LOBs) with tools from physics and stochastic processes, our proposed framework captures the creation and annihilation of orders, order matching, and the time evolution of the LOB state. It also enables compositional settings, accommodating the interaction of heterogeneous traders and different market structures. We employ Dirac notation and generalized generating functions to describe the state space and dynamics of LOBs. The utility of this framework is shown through simulations of simplified market scenarios, illustrating how variations in trader behavior impact key market observables such as spread, return volatility, and liquidity. The algebraic representation allows for exact simulations using the Gillespie algorithm, providing a robust tool for exploring the implications of market design and policy changes on LOB dynamics. Future research can expand this framework to incorporate more complex order types, adaptive event rates, and multi-asset trading environments, offering deeper insights into market microstructure and trader behavior and estimation of key drivers for market microstructure dynamics.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Financial Markets: A Framework for Nonstationary Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new causal structure learning method for nonstationary time series data, a common data type found in fields such as finance, economics, healthcare, and environmental science. Our work builds upon the constraint-based causal discovery from nonstationary data algorithm (CD-NOD). We introduce a refined version (CD-NOTS) which is designed specifically to account for lagged dependencies in time series data. We compare the performance of different algorithmic choices, such as the type of conditional independence test and the significance level, to help select the best hyperparameters given various scenarios of sample size, problem dimensionality, and availability of computational resources. Using the results from the simulated data, we apply CD-NOTS to a broad range of real-world financial applications in order to identify causal connections among nonstationary time series data, thereby illustrating applications in factor-based investing, portfolio diversification, and comprehension of market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Kernel Three Pass Regression Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We forecast a single time series using a high-dimensional set of predictors. When these predictors share common underlying dynamics, an approximate latent factor model provides a powerful characterization of their co-movements Bai(2003). These latent factors succinctly summarize the data and can also be used for prediction, alleviating the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional prediction exercises, see Stock &amp; Watson (2002a). However, forecasting using these latent factors suffers from two potential drawbacks. First, not all pervasive factors among the set of predictors may be relevant, and using all of them can lead to inefficient forecasts. The second shortcoming is the assumption of linear dependence of predictors on the underlying factors. The first issue can be addressed by using some form of supervision, which leads to the omission of irrelevant information. One example is the three-pass regression filter proposed by Kelly &amp; Pruitt (2015). We extend their framework to cases where the form of dependence might be nonlinear by developing a new estimator, which we refer to as the Kernel Three-Pass Regression Filter (K3PRF). This alleviates the aforementioned second shortcoming. The estimator is computationally efficient and performs well empirically. The short-term performance matches or exceeds that of established models, while the long-term performance shows significant improvement.</description>
