      <title>Time-resolved X-ray spectra of Proxima Centauri as seen by XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar soft X-ray ([1, 100] Angstrom) and Extreme Ultraviolet (also EUV, [100, 920] Angstrom; jointly, XUV) radiation affects the evolution and chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. It is however uncertain to what extent the radiation's short-term variability contributes to these effects. We are interested in what this variability might imply for planets around M dwarf stars, and focus on Proxima Centauri (Prox Cen) for three reasons: it is an active M dwarf with high levels of variability; it hosts a likely terrestrial exoplanet within its habitable zone (HZ) that will be a prime target for future direct imaging; its proximity has led to extensive observations. We set out to produce time-resolved XUV spectra of Prox Cen that will serve as input to atmospheric models, and to characterize the intrinsic variability of the star. We analyzed the entire dataset of archival XMM-Newton observations for Prox Cen. To derive the time-resolved X-ray spectra, we implemented a new pile-up correction, a new adaptive time-binning algorithm, and a time-dependent plasma model selection. The estimated EUV spectrum is based on a published template, that we scale with proposed relationships between X-ray and EUV fluxes. We produced spectra of Prox Cen from 1 to 920 Angstrom over ~260 ks of observations with unprecedented time resolution. The instantaneous X-ray flux of Prox Cen varies between about 20 times and one-fifth of the average value over the available baseline, with significant differences between wavelengths. We further quantify how variability affects the estimated average flux when a limited number of snapshots (each typically of 30 ks exposure) are available, as is common in X-ray surveys. Future investigations of the atmospheres of Prox Cen b should fold in the time variability and uncertainties described here.</description>

      <title>Double Hot Jupiter Formation through Mirrored ZLK Migration in Binary Star Systems: The Case of WASP-94</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, only a handful of binary star systems are known with at least one confirmed planet orbiting each star. Such systems, however, offer a unique perspective on the stochasticity intrinsic to planet formation and evolution -- particularly in twin binary star systems, which consist of near-equal-mass stars formed contemporaneously in the same birth environment. The WASP-94 system, which includes twin F-type stars, is a striking exemplar of such systems, containing two hot Jupiters: WASP-94 Ab is a transiting, spin-orbit misaligned giant planet with a 4-day orbital period, while WASP-94 Bb is non-transiting and has a tighter 2-day orbital period. In this work, we leverage N-body simulations to show that the current double hot Jupiter configuration of the WASP-94 system can be reproduced through mirrored von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration. The upcoming Gaia astrometric data releases offer the potential to search for additional twin planetary systems, including double cold Jupiter systems that may serve as the progenitors for WASP-94-like configurations.</description>

      <title>A Search for Radio Technosignatures from Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS with the Allen Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2025 July, the third-ever interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, was discovered on its ingress into the Solar System. Similar to the NASA Voyager missions sent in 1977, science probes by extraterrestrial life (artifact ``technosignatures'') could be sent to explore other stellar systems like our own. In this campaign, we used the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to observe 3I/ATLAS from 1--9~GHz. We detected nearly 74 million narrowband hits in 7.25~hr of data using the newly-developed search pipeline \texttt{bliss}. We then applied blanking in frequency and drift rate to mitigate Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in our dataset, narrowing the dataset down to $\sim$2 million hits. These hits were further filtered by the localization code \texttt{NBeamAnalysis}, and the remaining 211 hits were visually inspected in the time-frequency domain. We did not find any signals worthy of additional follow-up. Accounting for the Doppler drift correction and given the non-detection, we are able to set an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limit of $10-110$~W on radio technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS across the frequency and drift rate ranges covered by our survey.</description>

      <title>The size of 3I/ATLAS from non-gravitational acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third macroscopic interstellar object detected in the solar system recently passed through perihelion, with the best-fitting models of its trajectory now featuring non-gravitational accelerations. We assess how much mass loss is required to produce plausible non-gravitational acceleration solutions and compare with estimates of the mass loss. We find that they are consistent when the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is around 1 km in diameter. For a recent solution with a time lag in the acceleration from Eubanks et al, we find diameters between 820 meters and 1050 meters, assuming an outgassing asymmetry factor $\zeta=0.5$ and a density of the comet nucleus $\rho=0.5$ g cm$^{-3}$. The limits on the diameter scale as $(\zeta/\rho)^{1/3}$. Substantial extrapolation is required in general to compare non-gravitational accelerations to mass loss rates, so reliable estimates of the mass loss rate at other stages of the comet's trajectory will substantially reduce the systematic uncertainty in this estimate.</description>

      <title>Imaging the LkCa 15 system in polarimetry and total intensity without self-subtraction artefacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying young protoplanetary disks is essential for understanding planet formation, but traditional angular differential imaging can introduce self-subtraction artefacts that hinder interpretation of small-scale structures. We present high-resolution total- and polarized-intensity Ks-band images of the LkCa~15 system obtained with SPHERE using near-simultaneous reference-star differential imaging (star-hopping), yielding self-subtraction-free images beyond 0.1 arcsec. LkCa~15 hosts a ~160 au protoplanetary disk and has previously been reported to harbour candidate protoplanets at separations of 15--18 au. We analyse the disk morphology and dust properties and search for super-Jupiter planets beyond 20 au. We first model the near-infrared scattered-light images together with ALMA submillimetre continuum data using RADMC-3D and a two grain-size (micron and millimetre) compact olivine model. While this model broadly reproduces the disk geometry, it overpredicts the degree of forward scattering in the near-infrared. To investigate this discrepancy, we extract the scattering phase function S(theta) and polarized fraction P(theta) from the SPHERE data and compare them with aggregate-scattering models. The observed phase functions disfavour compact Mie spheres and are better matched by porous aggregates (CAHP). Recomputing the scattered-light models with porous CAHP grains in the disk surface layer significantly improves agreement with the observed Ks-band morphology and polarization, while retaining compact millimetre grains to reproduce the ALMA continuum. No new planetary companions are detected; we place upper mass limits of ~1.5 MJ beyond 200 au and ~3.6 MJ in the inner disk. Our results demonstrate that combining star-hopping imaging with phase-function diagnostics provides strong constraints on dust grain properties in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Detecting false positives with PLATO using double-aperture photometry and centroid shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PLATO will discover exoplanets around Sun-like stars through transit photometry and characterize their host stars using asteroseismology. Since photometry for most PLATO targets will be extracted on board, an efficient strategy to detect false positives (FPs), defined as transit-like signals not caused by planets, is required. Centroid shifts are a standard FP diagnostic, but only 5% to 20% of PLATO's largest stellar sample (P5) will have centroids computed on board, motivating the need for an alternative strategy. We propose a double-aperture photometry approach to detect FPs, testing two mask types: extended masks, which enlarge the nominal aperture, and secondary masks, centered on the main contaminant. For each mask type, we derive flux and centroid-shift metrics and evaluate their ability to discriminate FPs. Using Gaia DR3, we define P5 targets and their background stars, which are assumed to be eclipsing binaries with transit depths and durations drawn from observed distributions. From simulated photometry and centroid shifts, we compute extended and secondary fluxes as well as extended, secondary, and nominal centroids, and compare their FP detection efficiency. Under these assumptions, approximately 35% of P5 targets have a single FP-producing contaminant and about 22% have two or more. Secondary flux achieves the highest detection efficiency (92%), followed by extended centroid shifts (87%) and nominal centroids (84%). Owing to its lower computational and telemetry cost, double-aperture photometry provides an efficient solution for rejecting a large fraction of FP signals caused by eclipsing binaries.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopy of Salt Deposits from the Simulated Subsurface Ocean of Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturn's ice-covered moon Enceladus may host a subsurface ocean with biologically relevant chemistry. Plumes released from this ocean preserve information on its chemical state, and previous analyses suggest weakly to strongly alkaline pH (approximately pH 8--12). Constraining the pH requires identification of pH-sensitive minerals in plume deposits. Several analytical techniques could provide such mineralogical information, but few are practical for deployment on planetary missions. Raman spectrometers, which have recently advanced for \textit{in situ} exploration and have been incorporated into flight instruments, offer a feasible approach for mineral identification on icy moons. However, their applicability to pH estimation from plume-derived minerals has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluate whether Raman measurements of plume particles deposited on the surface of Enceladus can be used to distinguish between weakly and strongly alkaline subsurface ocean models. Fluids with pH values of 9 and 11 were frozen under vacuum conditions analogous to those on Enceladus. The resulting salt deposits were then analyzed using a flight-like Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectra show pH-dependent carbonate precipitation: NaHCO$_3$ and Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 9, whereas only Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 11. These findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can distinguish pH-dependent carbonate phases. This capability allows us to constrain whether the pH of the subsurface ocean is weakly alkaline or strongly alkaline, which is a key parameter for assessing its chemical evolution and potential habitability.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability of Moons Around the TRAPPIST-1 Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical stability of potential satellites orbiting the seven planets of the \texttt{TRAPPIST-1} system using a suite of $N$-body simulations. For each planet, we show that moons can remain stable from the Roche limit out to near the theoretical prograde stability boundary at roughly $0.5$ Hill Radii. We quantify how perturbations from neighbouring planets modify these stability limits. Although the overall effect of individual perturbers is generally weak, the combined gravitational influence of the full multi-planet configuration produces a modest contraction of the outer stable radius, notably for \texttt{TRAPPIST-1 b} and \texttt{TRAPPIST-1 e}. For each of the seven planets, the outer stability limit for satellites is at 40-45\% of the Hill radius, consistent with previous work. Using simple long-term tidal decay calculations, we show that the most massive satellites that could survive over Gyr timescales are $10^{-(7-9)} M_\oplus$ (with higher possible masses for the outer planets).</description>

      <title>Disentangling the hemispheres of Teegarden's Star b with LIFE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teegarden's Star is one of the most promising targets for the first observations of LIFE, as a non-transiting rocky planet with similar bulk properties to the Earth, and a relatively quiescent M-dwarf host star. We use LIFEsim, a software developed by the ETH LIFE team, along with thermal emission maps obtained from a suite of three-dimensional global climate model (GCM) simulations, to explore the sensitivity of LIFE to the observation geometry. We find that 3 days of observation in broadband would be enough to disentangle the hemispheres of the planet with a 1{\sigma} or 3{\sigma} confidence level with a baseline or optimistic scenario respectively. Doing the same for a fast-rotator in the habitable zone of a G-class star would be prohibitively challenging. Given enough observation time, the sensitivity of LIFE may allow some spatial resolution of Teegarden's Star b to be achieved, which may directly link to the presence of water clouds and therefore an active hydrology.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution NUV Transmission Spectrum of KELT-9b: Mg II and Fe II Escaping from the Hottest Known Giant Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution NUV observations from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) data for the hottest known gas planet, KELT-9b. Observations were collected with STIS/E230M (2300-3000 $\r{A}$, R$\sim$ 30,000) and we de-correlate systematic effects from the telescope using jitter detrending. We show the clear presence of the Mg II doublet at 2800 $\r{A}$ and Fe II at 2600 $\r{A}$ in KELT-9b. The Mg II is measured above the planet's Roche transit radius, indicating it is escaping. We fit 1D NLTE atmospheric escape models to these features, demonstrating a significant loss of mass in KELT-9b's atmosphere ($\dot{M} \approx 10^{12} $ g/s); we also find a remarkably high line-broadening corresponding to a velocity of about $50-75$ km/s, and a net blueshift of the Mg II doublet greater than 30 km/s. Future 3D MHD modeling of the spectrum and gas kinematics is likely needed to explain these observations. We interpret these results in the context of the Mg II ``Cosmic Shoreline" and show that the detection of escaping Mg II in KELT-9b and the non-detection in WASP-178b are consistent with the hypothesis that stars hotter than $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \sim$ 8250~K have relatively low levels of XUV radiation due to the lack of a chromosphere. Therefore planets around such early-type stars experience a different degree of atmospheric escape. This result highlights the importance of XUV irradiation in driving atmospheric escape inside and outside the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Bridging stellar evolution and planet formation: from birth, to survivors of the fittest, to the second generation of planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.</description>

      <title>Red noise-based false alarm thresholds for astrophysical periodograms via Whittle's approximation to the likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomers who search for periodic signals using Lomb-Scargle periodograms rely on false alarm level (FAL) estimates to identify statistically significant peaks. Although FALs are often calculated from white noise models, many astronomical time series suffer from red noise. Prewhitening is a statistical technique in which a continuum model is subtracted from log power spectrum estimate, after which the observer can proceed with a white-noise treatment. Here we present a prewhitening-based method of calculating frequency-dependent FALs. We fit power laws and autoregressive models of order 1 to each Lomb-Scargle periodogram by minimizing the Whittle approximation to the negative log-likelihood (NLL), then calculate FALs based on the best-fit model power spectrum. Our technique is a novel extension of the Whittle NLL to datasets with uneven time sampling. We demonstrate FAL calculations using observations of $\alpha$~Cen~B, GJ~581, HD 192310, synthetic data from the radial velocity (RV) Fitting Challenge, and {\it Kepler} observations of a differential rotator. The {\it Kepler} data analysis shows that only true rotation signals are detected by red-noise FALs, while white-noise FALs suggest all spurious peaks in the low-frequency range are significant. A high-frequency sinusoid injected into $\alpha$~Cen~B $\log R^{\prime}_{HK}$ observations exceeds the 1\% red-noise FAL despite having only 8.9\% of the power of the dominant rotation signal. In a periodogram of HD 192310 RVs, peaks associated with differential rotation and planets are detected against the 5\% red-noise FAL without iterative model fitting or subtraction. Software for calculating red noise-based FALs is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Mars' Induced Magnetic Field and Clock Angle Departures under Real-Time Upstream Solar Wind Conditions</title>

Abstract: Mars lacks a global intrinsic dipole magnetic field, but its interaction with the solar wind generates a global induced magnetosphere. Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations.</description>

      <title>Energetically-dominant Sunward-Propagating Alfv\'en Waves Near 1 au and Their Relation to Large-scale Magnetic Switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the population of energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\'en waves (SAWs) using more than 20 years of data provided by the Wind spacecraft near 1 au. We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\'en waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The searches for other life and for intelligence are fundamental problems that science faces today. Most searches so far have been focused on radio, but optical laser communication is an alternative, well suited for a ground-based observatory. A project to search for artificial laser communications with the current and future extreme multiplexity spectroscopic facilities that ESO may develop by the 2040s is outlined. The monochromatic light is a clearly identifiable technosignature. The enormous corollary outreach potential of this initiative is underlined.</description>

      <title>Periodicities in radio emissions from the Jupiter's magnetosphere and consequences for radio emissions from star-exoplanet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for radio signals from exoplanets or star-planet interactions is a topic of major scientific interest, as it is likely the best way to detect and measure a planetary magnetic field and, therefore, to probe the inner structure of exoplanets. However, detecting these radio emissions is challenging, since they are anisotropic by nature, sporadic, and of low intensity because of their great distances, and because the sky cannot be monitored continuously. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations, and identify the implications of the measured period. The identification of periodic radio signals is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle analysis. We first apply the technique to simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows us to characterize the origin of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as to identify peaks corresponding to real periods in the studied system, and to harmonic or beat periods. We then validate this method with a real signal, using approximately 1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years, to detect the periodicities of Jovian radio emissions (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the LombScargle periodogram allows us to correctly identify periodic radio signals, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the beat period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, ...</description>

      <title>Challenges in the detection of gases in exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on comparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species. However, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction is vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is typically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of trace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust identification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low signal-to-noise regime. Using the sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a case study, we show that recent biosignature claims vanish when the model space is expanded, with numerous alternatives providing equally good or better fits. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed detection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model preference does not in itself imply the presence of a specific gas. We recommend treating model comparisons instead as relative adequacy tests, which should be supported by theoretical predictions and complementary metrics of statistical significance in order to attribute a signal to a particular gas.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Investigation of HD 209458 b HST &amp; JWST Transmission Spectra with SANSAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HD 209458 b is the first exoplanet on which an atmosphere was detected. Since then, its atmosphere has been investigated using multiple telescopes and instruments. However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable. While HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST NIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity with highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD 209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a newly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model with free retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and C/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar values using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam observations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and C/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model choice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry retrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar constraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone can lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and, therefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared observations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity. In particular, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we cannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline.</description>

      <title>On the statistical convergence of N-body simulations of the Solar System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most direct N-body integrations of planetary systems use a symplectic integrator with a fixed timestep. A large timestep is desirable in order to speed up the numerical simulations. However, simulations yield unphysical results if the timestep is too large. Surprisingly, no systematic convergence study has been performed on long (Gyr) timescales. In this paper we present numerical experiments to determine the minimum timestep one has to use in long-term integrations of the Solar System in order to recover the system's fundamental secular frequencies and instability rate. We find that timesteps of up to 32 days, i.e. a third of Mercury's orbital period, yield physical results in an ensemble of 5 Gyr integrations. We argue that the chaotic diffusion that drives the Solar System's long-term evolution dominates over numerical diffusion and timestep resonances. Our results bolster confidence that the statistical results of most simulations in the literature are indeed physical and provide guidance on how to run time and energy efficient simulations while making sure results can be trusted.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive spectroscopic reference of the solar system and its application to exoplanet direct imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.</description>

      <title>TOI-3288 b and TOI-4666 b: two gas giants transiting low-mass stars characterised by NIRPS</title>

Abstract: Gas giant planets orbiting low-mass stars are uncommon outcomes of planet formation. Increasing the sample of well-characterised giants around early M dwarfs will enable population-level studies of their properties, offering valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary histories. We aim to characterise giant exoplanets transiting M dwarfs identified by TESS. High-resolution spectroscopic data are obtained in the optical and nIR, combining HARPS and NIRPS. We derive RVs via the cross-correlation function and implement a novel post-processing procedure to further mitigate telluric contamination in the nIR. The resulting RVs are jointly fit with TESS and ground-based photometry to derive the orbital and physical parameters of the systems. We confirm two gas giants transiting the low-mass stars TOI-3288 A (K9V) and TOI-4666 (M2.5V). TOI-3288 A hosts a Hot Jupiter with a mass of $2.11\pm0.08~M_{\rm Jup}$ and a radius of $1.00 \pm 0.03~R_{\rm Jup}$, with an orbital period of 1.43 days ($T_{\rm eq} = 1059 \pm 20~{\rm K}$). TOI-4666 hosts a $0.70_{-0.06}^{+0.05}~M_{\rm Jup}$ warm Jupiter ($T_{\rm eq} = 713 \pm 14~{\rm K}$) with a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.04~R_{\rm Jup}$, and an orbital period of 2.91 days. We identify a decrease in planetary mass with spectral type, where late M dwarfs host less massive giant planets than early M dwarfs. More massive gas giants that deviate from this trend are preferentially hosted by more metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we find an increased binarity fraction among low-mass stars hosting gas giants, which may play a role in enhancing giant planet formation around low-mass stars. The observed population trends agree with theoretical expectations, where higher metallicity can compensate for lower disk masses, and wide binary systems may influence planet formation and migration through Kozai-Lidov cycles or disk instabilities.</description>

      <title>Unified Kraft Break at ~6500 K: A Newly Identified Single-Star Obliquity Transition Matches the Classical Rotation Break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar obliquity transition, defined by a $\textit{T}_{\rm eff}$ cut separating aligned from misaligned hot Jupiter systems, has long been assumed to coincide with the rotational Kraft break. Yet the commonly quoted obliquity transition (6100 or 6250 K) sits a few hundred kelvin cooler than the rotational break (~6500 K), posing a fundamental inconsistency. We show this offset arises primarily from binaries/multiple-star systems, which drive the cooler stellar obliquity transition ($6105^{+123}_{-133}$ K), although the underlying cause remains ambiguous. After removing binaries and higher-order multiples, the single-star stellar obliquity transition shifts upward to $6447^{+85}_{-119}$ K, in excellent agreement with the single-star rotation break ($6510^{+97}_{-127}$ K). This revision has two immediate consequences for understanding the origin and evolution of spin-orbit misalignment. First, the upward shift reclassifies some hosts previously labeled `hot' into the cooler regime; consequently, there are very few RM measurements of non-hot-Jupiter planets around genuinely hot stars ($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim6500\,\mathrm{K}$), and previously reported alignment trends for these classes of systems (e.g., warm Jupiters and compact multi-planet systems) lose the power to discriminate the central question: are large misalignments unique to hot-Jupiter-like planets that can be delivered by high-$e$ migration, or are hot stars intrinsically more misaligned across architectures? Second, a single-star stellar obliquity transition near $6500\,\mathrm{K}$, coincident with the rotational break, favors tidal dissipation in outer convective envelopes; as these envelopes thin with increasing $T_{\rm eff}$, inertial-wave damping and magnetic braking weaken in tandem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-precision chemical abundances for 20 FGK stars hosting planets observed in JWST Cycle 2 GO programs. Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>Dark wounds on icy moons: Ganymede's subsurface ocean as a dark matter detector</title>

Abstract: Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at masses of $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may collide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and leaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological timescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.</description>
