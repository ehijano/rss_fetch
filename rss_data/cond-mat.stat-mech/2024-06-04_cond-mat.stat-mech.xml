      <title>Markov-chain sampling for long-range systems without evaluating the energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In past decades, enormous effort has been expended to develop algorithms and even to construct special-purpose computers in order to efficiently evaluate total energies and forces for long-range-interacting particle systems, with the particle-mesh Ewald and the fast multipole methods as well as the 'Anton' series of supercomputers serving as examples for biomolecular simulations. Cutoffs in the range of the interaction have also been used for large systems. All these methods require extrapolations. Within Markov-chain Monte Carlo, in thermal equilibrium, the Boltzmann distribution can however be sampled natively without evaluating the total interaction potential. Using as an example the Lennard-Jones interaction, we review past attempts in this direction, and then discuss in detail the class of cell-veto algorithms which make possible fast, native sampling of the Boltzmann distribution without any approximation, extrapolation, or cutoff even for the slowly decaying Coulomb interaction. The computing effort per move remains constant with increasing system size, as we show explicitly. We provide worked-out illustrations and pseudocode representations of the discussed algorithms. Python implementations are made available in an associated open-source software repository.</description>

      <title>A Free-fermion Formulation of Two-dimensional Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising model is a famous toy model in condensed matter and statistical physics. In this work we present a free-fermion formulation of the two-dimensional classical Ising models on the honeycomb, triangular and Kagom\'e lattices. Each Ising model is studied in the case of a zero field and the case of an imaginary field i({\pi}/2)k_BT. We employ the decorated lattice technique, star-triangle transformation and weak-graph expansion method to exactly map each Ising model in both cases into an eight-vertex model on the square lattice. The resulting vertex weights are shown to satisfy the free-fermion condition. In the zero field case, each Ising model is an even free-fermion model. In the case of the imaginary field, the Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is an even free-fermion model while those on the triangular and Kagom\'e lattices are odd free-fermion models. The exact solution of the Kagom\'e lattice Ising model in the imaginary field i({\pi}/2)k_BT is obtained, which has not been reported in previous works. The frustrated Ising models on the triangular and Kagom\'e lattices in the imaginary field still exhibit a non-zero residual entropy.</description>

      <title>Multiple Quantum Harmonic Oscillators in the Tsallis statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied multiple quantum harmonic oscillators in the Tsallis statistics of entropic parameter $q&gt;1$, separately applying the unnormalized $q$-expectation value and the normalized $q$-expectation value (escort average). We obtained the expressions of the energy and the Tsallis entropy, using the Barnes zeta function. For the same oscillators, we obtained the expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, the average level of the oscillators, and the heat capacity. Numerically, we calculated the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity for various $N$ and $q$, using the expansion of the Barnes zeta function with the Hurwitz zeta function, where $N$ is the number of independent oscillators. It was shown from the requirement for the Barnes zeta function that the quantity $N (q-1)$ is less than one. In the Tsallis statistics with the unnormalized $q$-expectation value, the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity are $N$-dependent and $q$-dependent. The $N$-dependences and the $q$-dependences of these quantities at low temperature are different from those at high temperature. The heat capacity is the Schottky-type. These quantities are affected by zero point energy. In the Tsallis statistics with the normalized $q$-expectation value, the $N$-dependences and the $q$-dependences of the energy per oscillator and those of the heat capacity are quite weak, when the equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, is adopted. The $N$-dependence and the $q$-dependence of the Tsallis entropy are clearly seen.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in long-ranged open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional fermionic lattice system with long-ranged power-law decaying hopping with exponent $\alpha$. The system is further subjected to dephasing noise in the bulk. We investigate two variants of the problem: (i) an open quantum system where the setup is further subjected to boundary reservoirs enabling the scenario of a non-equilibrium steady state charge transport, and (ii) time dynamics of an initially localized single particle excitation in the absence of boundary reservoirs. In both variants, anomalous super-diffusive behavior is observed for $1&lt; \alpha&lt; 1.5$, and for $\alpha&gt; 1.5$ the setup is effectively short-ranged and exhibits conventional diffusive transport. Our findings are supported by analytical calculations based on the multiple-scale analysis technique that leads to the emergence of a fractional diffusion equation for the density profile. Our study unravels an interesting interplay between long-range interaction and dephasing mechanism that could result in the emergence of unconventional behaviour in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Refined Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation for Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations elucidate the intricate balance between the precision of current and the thermodynamic costs or dissipation, marking a recent and enthralling advancement at the confluence of statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and information theory. In this study, we derive a time-energy uncertainty relation tailored for chemical reactions, expressed in terms of the Gibbs free energy and chemical potential. This inequality holds true irrespective of whether the total substance of chemical species is conserved during the reaction. Furthermore, it supports the general thermodynamic framework by ensuring the spontaneous decrease in Gibbs free energy. We present two formulations of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation: one based on chemical species concentrations and the other on molar fractions. The validity of our inequalities is numerically demonstrated using model systems of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky and Michaelis-Menten reactions. Our uncertainty relation may find practical applications in measuring and optimizing thermodynamic properties relevant to chemical reaction systems out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Effect of relative timescale on a system of particles sliding on a fluctuating energy landscape: Exact derivation of product measure condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of hardcore particles advected by a fluctuating potential energy landscape, whose dynamics is in turn affected by the particles. Earlier studies have shown that as a result of two-way coupling between the landscape and the particles, the system shows an interesting phase diagram as the coupling parameters are varied. The phase diagram consists of various different kinds of ordered phases and a disordered phase. We introduce a relative timescale $\omega$ between the particle and landscape dynamics, and study its effect on the steady state properties. We find there exists a critical value $\omega = \omega_{c}$ when all configurations of the system are equally likely in the steady state. We prove this result exactly in a discrete lattice system and obtain an exact expression for $\omega_c$ in terms of the coupling parameters of the system. We show that $\omega_c$ is finite in the disordered phase, diverges at the boundary between the ordered and disordered phase, and is undefined in the ordered phase. We also derive $\omega_c$ from a coarse-grained level description of the system using linear hydrodynamics. We start with the assumption that there is a specific value $\omega^\ast$ of the relative timescale when correlations in the system vanish, and mean-field theory gives exact expressions for the current Jacobian matrix $A$ and compressibility matrix $K$. Our exact calculations show that Onsager-type current symmetry relation $AK = KA^{T}$ can be satisfied if and only if $\omega^\ast = \omega_c$ . Our coarse-grained model calculations can be easily generalized to other coupled systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a perspective of simple models of nonequilibrium directed transport described in terms of a Langevin equation formalism. We consider a Brownian particle under various circumstances and driven by thermal (equilibrium) and non-thermal (active) fluctuations. Three examples of startling behavior are unveiled: giant transport, multiple current reversal and negative mobility.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in symmetric zero-range process below and at critical density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing current fluctuations in a stationary state is of fundamental interest and has attracted considerable attention in the recent past. However, bulk of the studies are limited to systems that either do not exhibit a phase transition or are far from criticality. Here we consider a symmetric zero-range process on a ring that is known to show a phase transition in the stationary state. We use a microscopic approach to analytically calculate two density-dependent transport coefficients that characterize the first two cumulants of the time-integrated current. We show that on the hydrodynamic scale, away from the critical point, the variance of the time-integrated current grows with time $t$ as $\sqrt{t}$ and $t$ at short and long times, respectively. Moreover, we find an expression of the full scaling function for the variance of the cumulative current and thereby the amplitude of the temporal growth of the current fluctuations. At the critical point, using a scaling theory, we find that while the above mentioned long-time scaling of the variance of the cumulative current continues to hold, the short time behavior is anomalous in that the growth exponent is larger than one-half and varies continuously with the model parameters.</description>

      <title>From high-dimensional committors to reactive insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition path theory (TPT) offers a powerful formalism for extracting the rate and mechanism of rare dynamical transitions between metastable states. Most applications of TPT either focus on systems with modestly sized state spaces or use collective variables to try to tame the curse of dimensionality. Increasingly, expressive function approximators like neural networks and tensor networks have shown promise in computing the central object of TPT, the committor function, even in very high dimensional systems. That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight. Here, we present and illustrate a straightforward but powerful way to track how individual dynamical coordinates evolve during a reactive event. The strategy, which involves marginalizing the reactive ensemble, naturally captures the evolution of the dynamical coordinate's distribution, not just its mean reactive behavior.</description>

      <title>Coarse Grained Molecular Dynamics with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a sampling algorithm relying on a collective variable (CV) of mid-size dimension modelled by a normalizing flow and using non-equilibrium dynamics to propose full configurational moves from the proposition of a refreshed value of the CV made by the flow. The algorithm takes the form of a Markov chain with non-local updates, allowing jumps through energy barriers across metastable states. The flow is trained throughout the algorithm to reproduce the free energy landscape of the CV. The output of the algorithm are a sample of thermalized configurations and the trained network that can be used to efficiently produce more configurations. We show the functioning of the algorithm first on a test case with a mixture of Gaussians. Then we successfully test it on a higher dimensional system consisting in a polymer in solution with a compact and an extended stable state separated by a high free energy barrier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing a class of SU(2) invariant quantum unitary circuits generating chiral transport, we examine the role of broken space-reflection and time-reversal symmetries on spin transport properties. Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the structure of systems in nonequilibrium steady states necessitates tools that quantify population shifts and associated deformations of equilibrium free energy landscapes under persistent currents. Within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, we establish a variant of the Kawasaki--Crooks equality that relates nonequilibrium free energy corrections in driven systems to heat dissipation statistics along time-reversed relaxation trajectories computable with molecular simulation. Using stochastic control theory, we arrive at a variational approach to evaluate the Kawasaki--Crooks equality and use it to estimate distribution functions of order parameters in overdamped Langevin models of active matter, attaining substantial improvement in accuracy over simple perturbative methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition of infrared radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a phase transition of infrared radiation, driven by quantum fluctuations, which takes place at the boundary of (the conformal diagram of) Minkowski spacetime. Specifically, we consider a family of states interpolating between the vacuum and the Kraus-Polley-Reents infravacuum. A state from this family can be imagined as a static source emitting flashes of infrared radiation in distant past. The flashes are in suitable squeezed states and the time intervals between them are controlled by a certain parameter r. For r&lt;0 the states are lightcone normal, thus physically indistinguishable from local excitations of the vacuum. They suffer from the usual infrared problems such as disintegration of the Bloch-Nordsieck S-matrix and rotational symmetry breaking by soft photon clouds. However, for r&gt;0 lightcone normality breaks down, the S-matrix is stabilized by the Kraus-Polley-Reents mechanism and the rotational symmetry is restored. We interpret these two situations as ordered (r&lt;0) and disordered (r&gt;0) phase of infrared radiation, and show that they can be distinguished by asymptotic fluctuations of the fields. We also determine the singular behaviour of some S-matrix elements near the critical point r=0.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Restarting to Overcome Overfitting in Neural Networks with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its prevalence, giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that restarting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually overfit to the noisy labels. To combat this overfitting phenomenon, we developed a method based on stochastic restarting, which has been actively explored in the statistical physics field for finding targets efficiently. By approximating the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent into Langevin dynamics, we theoretically show that restarting can provide great improvements as the batch size and the proportion of corrupted data increase. We then empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by restarting. An important aspect of our method is its ease of implementation and compatibility with other methods, while still yielding notably improved performance. We envision it as a valuable tool that can complement existing methods for handling noisy labels.</description>

      <title>Chaos controlled and disorder driven phase transitions by breaking permutation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing disorder in a system typically breaks symmetries and can introduce dramatic changes in its properties such as localization. At the same time, the clean system can have distinct many-body features depending on how chaotic it is. In this work the effect of permutation symmetry breaking by disorder is studied in a system which has a controllable and deterministic regular to chaotic transition. Results indicate a continuous phase transition from an area-law to a volume-law entangled phase irrespective of whether there is chaos or not, as the strength of the disorder is increased. The critical disorder strength obtained by finite size scaling, indicate a strong dependence on whether the clean system is regular or chaotic to begin with. In the process, we also obtain the critical exponents associated with this phase transition. Additionally, we find that a relatively small disorder is seen to be sufficient to delocalize a chaotic system.</description>

      <title>Melting and Freezing of a Skyrmion Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report comprehensive Monte-Carlo studies of the melting of skyrmion lattices in systems of small, medium, and large sizes with the number of skyrmions ranging from $10^{3}$ to over $10^{5}$. Large systems exhibit hysteresis similar to that observed in real experiments on the melting of skyrmion lattices. For sufficiently small systems which achieve thermal equilibrium, a fully reversible sharp solid-liquid transition on temperature with no intermediate hexatic phase is observed. A similar behavior is found on changing the magnetic field that provides the control of pressure in the skyrmion lattice. We find that on heating the melting transition occurs via a formation of grains with different orientations of hexagonal axes. On cooling, the fluctuating grains coalesce into larger clusters until a uniform orientation of hexagonal axes is slowly established. The observed scenario is caused by collective effects involving defects and is more complex than a simple picture of a transition driven by the unbinding and annihilation of dislocation and disclination pairs.</description>

      <title>Volichenko-type metasymmetry of braided Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents different mathematical structures connected with the parastatistics of braided Majorana qubits and clarifies their role; in particular, mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras belong to a more general framework than the Volichenko algebras defined in 1990 by Leites-Serganova as metasymmetries which do not respect even/odd gradings and lead to mixed brackets interpolating ordinary commutators and anticommutators. In a previous paper braided $Z_2$-graded Majorana qubits were first-quantized within a graded Hopf algebra framework endowed with a braided tensor product. The resulting system admits truncations at roots of unity and realizes, for a given integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$, an interpolation between ordinary Majorana fermions (recovered at $s=2$) and bosons (recovered in the $s\rightarrow \infty$ limit); it implements a parastatistics where at most $s-1$ indistinguishable particles are accommodated in a multi-particle sector. The structures discussed in this work are: - the quantum group interpretation of the roots of unity truncations recovered from reps of the quantum superalgebra ${\cal U}_q({{osp}}(1|2))$; - the reconstruction, via suitable intertwining operators, of the braided tensor products as ordinary tensor products; - the introduction of mixed brackets for the braided creation/annihilation operators which define generalized Heisenberg-Lie algebras; - the $s\rightarrow \infty$ untruncated limit of the mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras producing parafermionic oscillators; - (meta)symmetries of ordinary differential equations given by matrix Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $0+1$ dimension induced by the braided creation/annihilation operators; - in the special case of a third root of unity truncation, a nonminimal realization of the intertwining operators defines the system as a ternary algebra.</description>

      <title>Controlling Colloidal Flow through a Microfluidic Y-junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic particles flowing through narrow channels may accumulate near bifurcation points provoking flow reduction, clogging and ultimately chip breakage. Here we show that the full flow behavior of colloidal particles through a microfluidic Y-junction (i.e. a three way intersection) can be controlled by tuning the pair interactions and the degree of confinement. By combining experiments with numerical simulations, we investigate the dynamic states emerging when magnetizable colloids flow through a symmetric Y-junction such that a single particle can pass through both gates with the same probability. We show that clogging can be avoided by repulsive interactions and branching into the two channels can be steered as well by interactions: attractive particles are flowing through the same gate, while repulsive colloids alternate between the two gates. Even details of the particle assembly such as buckling at the exit gate are tunable by interactions and the channel geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamical clustering and wetting phenomena in inertial active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical clustering represents a characteristic feature of active matter consisting of self-propelled agents that convert energy from the environment into mechanical motion. At the micron scale, typical of overdamped dynamics, particles with opposite motility block each other and show transient dynamical arrest that can induce cluster nucleation and motility-induced phase separation. However, for macroscopic agents, inertia plays a leading role, and clustering is strongly affected by bounce-back effects during collisions that could inhibit cluster growth. Here we present an experiment on the clustering of active granular particles, in which inertia can be systematically tuned. A plethora of new phenomena impacted severely by inertia is presented. Clusters display an inertia-induced transition from liquid-like to crystal-like inner structures that is accompanied by the suppression of cluster nucleation at system boundaries due to particle inertia. In contrast to microswimmers, where active particles wet the boundary by primarily forming clusters attached to the container walls, in an underdamped inertial active system, walls do not favor cluster formation and effectively annihilate motility-induced wetting phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern quantum optical systems such as photonic quantum computers and quantum imaging devices require great precision in their designs and implementations in the hope to realistically exploit entanglement and reach a real quantum advantage. The theoretical and experimental explorations and validations of these systems are greatly dependent on the precision of our classical simulations. However, as Hilbert spaces increases, traditional computational methods used to design and optimize these systems encounter hard limitations due to the quantum curse of dimensionally. To address this challenge, we propose an approach based on neural and tensor networks to approximate the exact unitary evolution of closed entangled systems in a precise, efficient and quantum consistent manner. By training the networks with a reasonably small number of examples of quantum dynamics, we enable efficient parameter estimation in larger Hilbert spaces, offering an interesting solution for a great deal of quantum metrology problems.</description>

      <title>Intertwining and propagation of mixtures for generalized KMP models and harmonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic models of mass transport on discrete vertex set $V$. For these models, a one-parameter family of homogeneous product measures $\otimes_{i\in V} \nu_\theta$ is reversible. We prove that the set of mixtures of inhomogeneous product measures with equilibrium marginals, i.e., the set of measures of the form \[ \int\Big(\bigotimes_{i\in V} \nu_{\theta_i}\Big) \,\Xi(\prod_{i\in V}d\theta_i) \] is left invariant by the dynamics in the course of time, and the ``mixing measure'' $\Xi$ evolves according to a Markov process which we then call ``the hidden parameter model''. This generalizes results from [7] to a larger class of models and on more general graphs. The class of models includes discrete and continuous generalized KMP models, as well as discrete and continuous harmonic models. The results imply that in all these models, the non-equilibrium steady state of their reservoir driven version is a mixture of product measures where the mixing measure is in turn the stationary state of the corresponding ``hidden parameter model''. For the boundary-driven harmonic models on the chain $\{1,\ldots, N\}$ with nearest neighbor edges, we recover that the stationary measure of the hidden parameter model is the joint distribution of the ordered Dirichlet distribution (cf. [3]), with a purely probabilistic proof based on a spatial Markov property of the hidden parameter model.</description>

      <title>Automatic Input Feature Relevance via Spectral Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with high-dimensional data is a common practice, in the field of machine learning. Identifying relevant input features is thus crucial, so as to obtain compact dataset more prone for effective numerical handling. Further, by isolating pivotal elements that form the basis of decision making, one can contribute to elaborate on - ex post - models' interpretability, so far rather elusive. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Unlike existing techniques, the spectral features ranking is carried out automatically, as a byproduct of the network training. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Unusual low-temperature behavior in the half-filled band of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in atomic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a kind of finite-temperature pseudo-transition was observed in several quasi-one-dimensional models. In this work, we consider a genuine one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit, influenced by an external magnetic field and with the arbitrary number of particles controlled by the chemical potential. The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit was initially studied in the seventies and has been investigated over the past decades, but it still surprises us today with its fascinating properties. We rigorously analyze its low-temperature behavior using the transfer matrix technique and provide accurate numerical results. Our analysis confirms that there is an anomalous behavior in the half-filled band, specifically occurring between the alternating pair ($AP$) and paramagnetic ($PM$) phases at zero temperature. Previous investigations did not deeply identify this anomalous behavior, maybe due to the numerical simplicity of the model, but from analytical point of view this is not so easy to manipulate algebraically because one needs to solve an algebraic cubic equation. In this study, we explore this behavior and clearly distinguish the pseudo-transition, which could easily be mistaken with a real phase transition. This anomalous behavior mimics features of both first- and second-order phase transitions. However, due to its nature, we cannot expect a finite-temperature phase transition in this model.</description>

      <title>Structural prediction of super-diffusion in multiplex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion dynamics in multiplex networks can model a diverse number of real-world processes. In some specific configurations of these systems, the super-diffusion phenomenon arises, in which the diffusion is faster in the multiplex network than in any of its layers. Many studies attempt to characterize this phenomenon by examining its dependency on structural properties of the network, such as overlap, average degree, network dissimilarity, and others. While certain properties show a correlation with super-diffusion in specific networks, a broader characterization is still missing. Here, we introduce a structural parameter based on the minimum node strength that effectively predicts the occurrence of super-diffusion in multiplex networks. Additionally, we propose a novel framework for deriving analytical bounds for several multiplex networks structures. Finally, we analyze and justify why certain arrangements of the inter-layer connections induce super-diffusion. These findings provide novel insights into the super-diffusion phenomenon and the interplay between network structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in the PXP Model under Continuous Quasiperiodic Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments realizing long-lived non-equilibrium states in aperiodically driven quantum many-body systems, we investigate the dynamics of a quasiperiodically driven Rydberg atom chain in the strong Rydberg blockage regime. In this regime, the system is kinetically constrained and the `PXP' model describes its dynamics. Even without driving, the PXP model exhibits many-body scarring and resultant persistent oscillations for dynamics originating from the N\'{e}el-ordered initial state. We demonstrate that a rich array of dynamical behaviors emerge when the system is subjected to a continuous drive. In the high-frequency regime, the system exhibits revivals and oscillations for the N\'{e}el ordered initial state both for periodic and quasi-periodic drives. We trace the origin of this non-ergodicity to an effective PXP Hamiltonian for both of these driving protocols in this regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the behavior of the fidelity and the entanglement entropy is non-monotonic at low frequencies in the high-amplitude regime. This leads to several re-entrant scarring transitions both for both the N\'{e}el-ordered and the fully polarized initial state. Our results demonstrate that continuous quasi-periodic drive protocols can provide a promising route to realize prethermal phases of matter in kinetically constrained systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If we prepare an isolated, interacting quantum system in an eigenstate and perturb a local observable at an initial time, its expectation value will relax towards a thermal expectation value, even though the time evolution of the system is deterministic. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) of Deutsch and Srednicki suggests that this is possible because each eigenstate of the full quantum system acts as a thermal bath to its subsystems, such that the reduced density matrices of the subsystems resemble thermal density matrices. Here, we use the observation that the eigenvalue distribution of interacting quantum systems is a Gaussian under very general circumstances, and Dyson Brownian motion random matrix theory, to derive the ETH and thereby elevate it from hypothesis to theory. Our analysis provides a derivation of statistical mechanics which neither requires the concepts of ergodicity or typicality, nor that of entropy. Thermodynamic equilibrium follows solely from the applicability of quantum mechanics to large systems and the absence of integrability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theory (CFT) are of significant theoretical and experimental importance. The presence of defects theoretically enriches the structure of the CFT, but at the same time, it makes it more challenging to study, especially in dimensions higher than two. Here, we demonstrate that the recently-developed theoretical scheme, \textit{fuzzy (non-commutative) sphere regularization}, provides a powerful lens through which one can dissect the defect of 3D CFTs in a transparent way. As a notable example, we study the magnetic line defect of 3D Ising CFT and clearly demonstrate that it flows to a conformal defect fixed point. We have identified 6 low-lying defect primary operators, including the displacement operator, and accurately extract their scaling dimensions through the state-operator correspondence. Moreover, we also compute one-point bulk correlators and two-point bulk-defect correlators, which show great agreement with predictions of defect conformal symmetry, and from which we extract various bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients. Our work demonstrates that the fuzzy sphere offers a powerful tool for exploring the rich physics in 3D defect CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to a noisy quench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge of discoveries in the studies of thermodynamic inequalities: the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) and the entropic bound (EB) provide a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) in terms of nonequilibrium currents; the classical speed limit (CSL) expresses the lower bound on the EP using the geometry of probability distributions; the power-efficiency (PE) tradeoff dictates the maximum power achievable for a heat engine given the level of its thermal efficiency. In this study, we show that there exists a unified hierarchical structure encompassing all of these bounds, with the fundamental inequality given by a novel extension of the TUR (XTUR) that incorporates the most general range of current-like and state-dependent observables. By selecting more specific observables, the TUR and the EB follow from the XTUR, and the CSL and the PE tradeoff follow from the EB. Our derivations cover both Langevin and Markov jump systems, with the first proof of the EB for the Markov jump systems and a more generalized form of the CSL. We also present concrete examples of the EB for the Markov jump systems and the generalized CSL.</description>

Abstract: We show that numerical linked cluster expansions (NLCEs) based on sufficiently large building blocks allow one to obtain accurate low-temperature results for the thermodynamic properties of spin lattice models with continuous disorder distributions. Specifically, we show that such results can be obtained computing the disorder averages in the NLCE clusters before calculating their weights. We provide a proof of concept using three different NLCEs based on L, square, and rectangle building blocks. We consider both classical (Ising) and quantum (Heisenberg) spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models and show that convergence can be achieved down to temperatures that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the relevant energy scale in the model. Additionally, we provide evidence that in one dimension one can obtain accurate results for observables such as the energy down to their ground-state values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the broadening of initially localized wave packets in a quasi one-dimensional diamond ladder with interacting, spinless fermions. The lattice possesses a flat band causing localization. We place special focus on the transition away from the flat band many-body localized case by adding very weak dispersion. By doing so, we allow propagation of the wave packet on significantly different timescales which causes anomalous diffusion. Due to the temporal separation of dynamic processes, an interaction-induced, prethermal equilibrium becomes apparent. A physical picture of light and heavy modes for this prethermal behavior can be obtained within Born-Oppenheimer approximation via basis transformation of the original Hamiltonian. This reveals a detachment between light, symmetric and heavy, anti-symmetric particle species. We show that the prethermal state is characterized by heavy particles binding together mediated by the light particles.</description>

      <title>Reweight-annealing method for calculating the value of partition function via quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Sachdev-Ye Models with Read-Saleur Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an SU(M)-symmetric disordered bipartite spin model with unusual characteristics. Although superficially similar to the Sachdev-Ye model, it has several markedly different properties for M&gt;2. In particular, it has a large non-trivial nullspace whose dimension grows exponentially with system size. The states in this nullspace are frustration-free, and are ground states when the interactions are ferromagnetic. The exponential growth of the nullspace leads to Hilbert-space fragmentation and a violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We demonstrate that the commutant algebra responsible for this fragmentation is a non-trivial subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant algebra of certain nearest-neighbour models such as the spin-1 biquadratic spin chain. We also discuss the low-energy behaviour of correlations for the disordered version of this model in the limit of a large number of spins and large M, using techniques similar to those applied to the SY model. We conclude by generalizing the Shiraishi-Mori embedding formalism to non-local models, and apply it to turn some of our nullspace states into quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Effect of constraint relaxation on dynamic critical phenomena in minimum vertex cover problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of constraint relaxation on dynamic critical phenomena in the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs are investigated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Following our previous work that revealed the reduction of the critical temperature by constraint relaxation based on the penalty function method, this study focuses on investigating the critical properties of the relaxation time along its phase boundary. It is found that the dynamical correlation function of MVC with respect to the problem size and the constraint strength follows a universal scaling function. The analysis shows that the relaxation time decreases as the constraints are relaxed. This decrease is more pronounced for the critical amplitude than for the critical exponent, and this result is interpreted in terms of the system's microscopic energy barriers due to the constraint relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by experimental evidence collected when processing thin films from ternary solutions made of two solutes, typically polymers, and one solvent, we computationally study the morphology formation of domains obtained in three-state systems using both a lattice model and a continuum counterpart. The lattice-based approach relies on the Blume-Capel nearest neighbor model with bulk conservative Kawasaki dynamics, whereas as continuum system we consider a coupled system of evolution equations that is derived as hydrodynamic limit when replacing the nearest neighbor interaction in the lattice case by a suitable Kac potential. We explore how the obtained morphology depends on the solvent content in the mixture. In particular, we study how these scenarios change when the solvent is allowed to evaporate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of polymer condensation, i.e. the formation of bonds between reactive end-groups, is ubiquitous in both industry and biology. Here we study generic systems undergoing polymer condensation in competition with cyclisation. Using a generalised Smoluchowski theory, molecular dynamics simulations and experiments using DNA and T4 ligase, we find that this system displays a transition, from a regime with finite-length chains at infinite time and dominated by rings to one dominated by linear polymers that grow in time. Finally, we show that fluids prepared close to the transition may have profoundly different compositions and rheology at large condensation times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions encompass a variety of phenomena that occur in quantum systems exhibiting several possible symmetries. Traditionally, these transitions are explored by continuously varying a control parameter that connects two different symmetry configurations. Here we propose an alternative approach where the control parameter undergoes abrupt and time-periodic jumps between only two values. This approach yields results surprisingly similar to those obtained by the traditional one and may prove experimentally useful in situations where accessing the control parameter is challenging.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger as a Quantum Programmer: Estimating Entanglement via Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07911v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying entanglement is an important task by which the resourcefulness of a quantum state can be measured. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm that tests for and quantifies the separability of a general bipartite state by using the quantum steering effect, the latter initially discovered by Schr\"odinger. Our separability test consists of a distributed quantum computation involving two parties: a computationally limited client, who prepares a purification of the state of interest, and a computationally unbounded server, who tries to steer the reduced systems to a probabilistic ensemble of pure product states. To design a practical algorithm, we replace the role of the server with a combination of parameterized unitary circuits and classical optimization techniques to perform the necessary computation. The result is a variational quantum steering algorithm (VQSA), a modified separability test that is implementable on quantum computers that are available today. We then simulate our VQSA on noisy quantum simulators and find favorable convergence properties on the examples tested. We also develop semidefinite programs, executable on classical computers, that benchmark the results obtained from our VQSA. Thus, our findings provide a meaningful connection between steering, entanglement, quantum algorithms, and quantum computational complexity theory. They also demonstrate the value of a parameterized mid-circuit measurement in a VQSA.</description>

      <title>The Schwinger-Keldysh Coset Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coset construction is a tool for systematically building low energy effective actions for Nambu-Goldstone modes. This technique is typically used to compute time-ordered correlators appropriate for $S$-matrix computations for systems in their ground state. In this paper, we extend this technique to the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, which enables one to calculate a wider variety of correlators and applies also to systems in a mixed state. We focus our attention on internal symmetries and demonstrate that, after identifying the appropriate symmetry breaking pattern, Schwinger-Keldysh effective actions for Nambu-Goldstone modes can be constructed using the standard rules of the coset construction. Particular emphasis is placed on the thermal state and ensuring that correlators satisfy the KMS relation. We also discuss explicitly the power counting scheme underlying our effective actions. We comment on the similarities and differences between our approach and others that have previously appeared in the literature. In particular, our prescription does not require the introduction of additional ``diffusive'' symmetries and retains the full non-linear structure generated by the coset construction. We conclude with a series of explicit examples, including a computation of the finite-temperature two-point functions of conserved spin currents in non-relativistic paramagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferromagnets. Along the way, we also clarify the discrete symmetries that set antiferromagnets apart from ferromagnets, and point out that the dynamical KMS symmetry must be implemented in different ways in these two systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Scaling Advantage for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on a Classically Intractable Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate algorithm for solving optimization problems on quantum computers. However, the potential of QAOA to tackle classically intractable problems remains unclear. Here, we perform an extensive numerical investigation of QAOA on the low autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) problem, which is classically intractable even for moderately sized instances. We perform noiseless simulations with up to 40 qubits and observe that the runtime of QAOA with fixed parameters scales better than branch-and-bound solvers, which are the state-of-the-art exact solvers for LABS. The combination of QAOA with quantum minimum finding gives the best empirical scaling of any algorithm for the LABS problem. We demonstrate experimental progress in executing QAOA for the LABS problem using an algorithm-specific error detection scheme on Quantinuum trapped-ion processors. Our results provide evidence for the utility of QAOA as an algorithmic component that enables quantum speedups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Kipnis Marchioro Presutti (KMP) model a positive energy $\zeta_i$ is associated with each vertex $i$ of a finite graph with a boundary. When a Poisson clock rings at an edge $ij$ with energies $\zeta_i,\zeta_j$, those values are substituted by $U(\zeta_i+\zeta_j)$ and $(1-U)(\zeta_i+\zeta_j)$, respectively, where $U$ is a uniform random variable in $(0,1)$. A value $T_j\ge 0$ is fixed at each boundary vertex $j$. The dynamics is defined in such way that the resulting Markov process $\zeta(t)$, satisfies that $\zeta_j(t)$ is exponential with mean $T_j$, for each boundary vertex $j$, for all $t$. We show that the invariant measure is the distribution of a vector $\zeta$ with coordinates $\zeta_i=T_i X_i$, where $X_i$ are iid exponential$(1)$ random variables, the law of $T$ is the invariant measure for an opinion random averaging/gossip model with the same boundary conditions of $\zeta$, and the vectors $X$ and $T$ are independent. The result confirms a conjecture based on the large deviations of the model. When the graph is one-dimensional, we bound the correlations of the invariant measure and perform the hydrostatic limit. We show that the empirical measure of a configuration chosen with the invariant measure converges to the linear interpolation of the boundary values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of partial magnetic order in kagome-based magnets, we study the classical kagome Ising antiferromagnet, known as kagome spin ice, including further-neighbor interactions at zero and finite temperature. While the nearest-neighbor model displays an extensive ground-state degeneracy, various symmetry-breaking states can appear upon including additional couplings. Among these, peculiar partially ordered states have been proposed. We present results from large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations, establishing that such partial order is stabilized by third-neighbor couplings along the hexagon diagonals. We show that these states arise due to the emergence of one-dimensional chains in an entirely frustrated environment, and that they are stable with respect to further couplings. We discuss their finite-temperature properties in detail, highlight the magnetic states' peculiarities depending on the diagonal couplings' sign, and suggest observing these states using thermodynamic probes.</description>

      <title>Scalable molecular simulation of electrolyte solutions with quantum chemical accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unleashing the predictive power of molecular dynamics (MD), Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are revolutionizing our ability to simulate chemical systems with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Electrolyte solutions are a natural initial system to apply this tool to because they are critically important for a wide range of applications and their properties cannot currently be predicted. Unfortunately, however most DFT approximations are not sufficiently accurate to predict many practically relevant properties of electrolytes. Additionally, tracking the position of every atom in a system during molecular simulations is inherently limited, even with NNP-MD. Here, we use a state-of-the-art DFT approximation to demonstrate highly accurate all-atom NNPs with minimal training data. We demonstrate that NNPs can reliably be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained continuum solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales. We apply our technique to simulate lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and lithium bromide in water. We reproduce key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of these solutions in agreement with experimental data. The formation of a previously unknown Li cation dimer is observed, along with identical anion-anion interactions of chloride and bromide. Finally, the coarse-grained model is capable of reproducing crystal phase behavior and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained solely on moderate concentration solutions, disproving the notion that NNPs are only useful for interpolation. This approach should be scalable to determine the properties of electrolyte solutions over a much wider range of conditions and compositions than is possible experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adaptive immune system engages in an arms race with evolving viruses, trying to generate new responses to viral strains that continually move away from the set of variants that have already elicited a functional immune response. In previous work, it has been argued that this dynamical process can lead to a propagating pulse of ever-changing viral population and concomitant immune response. Here, we introduce a new stochastic model of viral-host coevolution and a deterministic approximation thereof with which to study these dynamics. We show that there is indeed a possible pulse solution, but for a large host population size, the pulse becomes unstable to the generation of new infections in its wake, leading to an extended endemic infection pattern. This time-dependent endemic pattern eventually reaches a fluctuating steady-state when the infected population size reaches a large enough fraction of the total number of hosts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The posterior covariance matrix W defined by the log-likelihood of each observation plays important roles both in the sensitivity analysis and frequentist evaluation of the Bayesian estimators. This study is focused on the matrix W and its principal space; we term the latter as an essential subspace. Projections to the essential subspace realize dimensional reduction in the sensitivity analysis and frequentist evaluation. A key tool for treating frequentist properties is the recently proposed Bayesian infinitesimal jackknife approximation(Giordano and Broderick (2023)). The matrix W can be interpreted as a reproducing kernel and is denoted as W-kernel. Using W-kernel, the essential subspace is expressed as a principal space given by the kernel principal component analysis. A relation to the Fisher kernel and neural tangent kernel is established, which elucidates the connection to the classical asymptotic theory. We also discuss a type of Bayesian-frequentist duality, naturally appeared from the kernel framework. Two applications are discussed: the selection of a representative set of observations and dimensional reduction in the approximate bootstrap. In the former, incomplete Cholesky decomposition is introduced as an efficient method for computing the essential subspace. In the latter, different implementations of the approximate bootstrap for posterior means are compared.</description>

      <title>Universal hard-edge statistics of non-Hermitian random matrices</title>

Abstract: Random matrix theory is a powerful tool for understanding spectral correlations inherent in quantum chaotic systems. Despite diverse applications of non-Hermitian random matrix theory, the role of symmetry remains to be fully established. Here, we comprehensively investigate the impact of symmetry on the level statistics around the spectral origin -- hard-edge statistics -- and expand the classification of spectral statistics to encompass all the 38 symmetry classes of non-Hermitian random matrices. Within this classification, we discern 28 symmetry classes characterized by distinct hard-edge statistics from the level statistics in the bulk of spectra, which are further categorized into two groups, namely the Altland-Zirnbauer$_0$ classification and beyond. We introduce and elucidate quantitative measures capturing the universal hard-edge statistics for all the symmetry classes. Furthermore, through extensive numerical calculations, we study various open quantum systems in different symmetry classes, including quadratic and many-body Lindbladians, as well as non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We show that these systems manifest the same hard-edge statistics as random matrices and that their ensemble-average spectral distributions around the origin exhibit emergent symmetry conforming to the random-matrix behavior. Our results establish a comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian random matrix theory and are useful in detecting quantum chaos or its absence in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolution in non-Lorentzian Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the computation of Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy (SREE) for boosted intervals in a two dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we compute the same in various non-Lorentzian limits, viz, Galilean and Carrollian Conformal Field Theory in same number of dimensions. We approach the problem both from a limiting perspective and by using intrinsic symmetries of respective non-Lorentzian conformal algebras. In particular, we calculate the leading order terms, logarithmic terms, and the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ terms and explicitly show exact compliance with $\textit{equipartition of entanglement}$, even in the non-Lorentzian system. Keeping in mind the holographic origin of SREE for the Carrollian limit, we further compute SREE for BMS$_{3}$-Kac-Moody, which couples a $U(1)\times U(1)$ theory with bulk gravity.</description>

      <title>Faster entanglement driven by quantum resonance in many-body kicked rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resonance in the paradigmatic kicked rotor system is a purely quantum effect that ignores the state of underlying classical chaos. In this work, it is shown that quantum resonance leads to superlinear entanglement production. In $N$-interacting kicked rotors set to be at quantum resonance, entanglement growth is super-linear until a crossover timescale $t^*$, beyond which growth slows down to a logarithmic form with superimposed oscillations. By mapping positional interaction to momentum space and analytically assessing the linear entropy, we unravel the mechanism driving these two distinct growth profiles. The analytical results agree with the numerical simulations performed for two- and three-interacting kicked rotors. The late time entanglement oscillation is sensitive to changes in scaled Planck's constant with a high quality factor suitable for high precision measurements. These results are amenable to an experimental realization on atom optics setup.</description>

      <title>Spread and Spectral Complexity in Quantum Spin Chains: from Integrability to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore spread and spectral complexity in quantum systems that exhibit a transition from integrability to chaos, namely the mixed-field Ising model and the next-to-nearest-neighbor deformation of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. We corroborate the observation that the presence of a peak in spread complexity before its saturation, is a characteristic feature in chaotic systems. We find that, in general, the saturation value of spread complexity post-peak depends not only on the spectral statistics of the Hamiltonian, but also on the specific state. However, there appears to be a maximal universal bound determined by the symmetries and dimension of the Hamiltonian, which is realized by the thermofield double state (TFD) at infinite temperature. We also find that the time scales at which the spread complexity and spectral form factor change their behaviour agree with each other and are independent of the chaotic properties of the systems. In the case of spectral complexity, we identify that the key factor determining its saturation value and timescale in chaotic systems is given by minimum energy difference in the theory's spectrum. This explains observations made in the literature regarding its earlier saturation in chaotic systems compared to their integrable counterparts. We conclude by discussing the properties of the TFD which, we conjecture, make it suitable for probing signatures of chaos in quantum many-body systems.</description>
