      <title>Cosmological Simulations of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy simulations have come a long way from the early days of simple N-body calculations, which considered only gravitational interactions, to the complex, multi-physics models used today. Beginning with initial conditions representative of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang, these modern simulations integrate the relevant physical processes involved in galaxy formation, such as gravity, gas dynamics, cooling, star formation, and feedback, while accounting for cosmic expansion and structure formation. This review provides an introductory overview of cosmological galaxy simulations, outlining the essential components and methods used to model the formation and evolution of galaxies on the computer. It also discusses common steps in the post-processing analysis, essential for extracting physical insights from these numerical experiments, along with basic tests to assess simulation validity and accuracy. Looking forward, next-generation simulations aim to push resolution boundaries, incorporate additional physical processes, and improve the robustness of the numerical models, promising to lead to a deeper understanding of how galaxies emerged and evolved over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Ruling out dominant electron scattering in Little Red Dots' Rosetta Stone using multiple hydrogen lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of Little Red Dots (LRDs) hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission, which recent studies propose originates from scattering off free electrons within an ionized and dense medium embedding the Broad Line Region (BLR), rather than directly from the BLR itself. This model suggests that the observed broad lines may be intrinsically narrower than observed, which would lead to black hole masses that are up to two orders of magnitude smaller than what inferred when assuming that the whole broad line comes from the BLR. To test this model, we present a joint analysis of multiple hydrogen recombination lines in the ''Rosetta Stone''AGN, the brightest known LRD at $z$=2.26. We show that H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Pa$\beta$ have different spectral profiles, which is inconsistent with the predictions of the simple electron scattering scenario. Additionally, we test a variety of exponential models and show that none of them can simultaneously reproduce all three line profiles with physically plausible parameters. The inadequacy of these models for the Rosetta Stone implies that the scenario of electron scattering by an ionized medium surrounding the BLR is not universally applicable to LRDs and AGN, and therefore provides a counterexample to the claim of a universal and systematic overestimation of black hole masses.</description>

      <title>The incidence of X-ray AGN and non-AGN galaxies in the far-infrared: insights into host galaxy properties and AGN obscuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the far-infrared (far-IR) incidence of X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and non-AGN galaxies as a function of stellar mass (M$_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and specific black hole accretion rate ($\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$), using data from five extragalactic fields (COSMOS, XMM-LSS, Stripe82, ELAIS-S1, and CDFS-SWIRE). We construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from optical-to-far-IR photometry to derive host galaxy properties and assess AGN obscuration. X-ray absorption is quantified using the 4XMM-DR11s catalog. Our final sample includes 172,697 non-AGN galaxies (53% Herschel-detected) and 2,417 X-ray AGN (73% Herschel-detected), with $10 &lt; log\,[M_*/M_\sun] &lt; 12$ and $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$. X-ray AGN exhibit a relatively flat far-IR detection rate across stellar mass and specific SFR ($sSFR = SFR / M_*$), unlike non-AGN galaxies, where detection correlates strongly with SFR. Among AGN, far-IR detection declines with increasing $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$, despite rising SFR. Our results suggest X-ray AGN are preferentially found in gas-rich environments, where star formation and black hole accretion coexist. Far-IR incidence remains high across all sSFR bins, supporting a scenario in which AGN feedback regulates, rather than abruptly quenches, star formation. Comparing AGN and non-AGN SFRs without separating Herschel-detected from non-detected sources introduces biases. Obscured AGN show ~10% higher far-IR detection rates than unobscured ones, yet at similar $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$, unobscured AGN tend to have higher SFR. This may suggest obscured AGN inhabit dustier systems with moderate star formation contributing to the far-IR. Our findings support a regulatory AGN feedback mode operating over extended timescales in gas-rich galaxies.</description>

      <title>Finding Halos in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that one can track down galaxies in absorption 'hidden' in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest through the use of 'strong, blended Lyman-$\alpha$' (or SBLA) absorption. Specifically a series of publications studied SBLA absorption systems with Lyman-$\alpha$ flux transmission, $F_{Ly \alpha} &lt; 0.25$ on scales of 138 km s$^{-1}$ in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In order to better understand the connection between halos and these SBLAs, we make use of several million synthetic absorption spectra from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, at z=2 and z=3. We explore spectra with SDSS-like resolution in order to understand the nature of SBLAs as defined thus far, as well as with high resolution (or 'resolved') spectra to generalise and optimise SBLAs as halo finders. For the SDSS SBLAs, we find that up to 78% of these absorption systems reside in hlaos, where the stronger the absorption and the lower the redshift, the higher the probability. We also manage to recover a mean halo mass of $10^{12.25} M_{\odot}$, in line with what is measured in observations. For the resolved SBLAs, we expand on the previous definition and allow the SBLA spectra size to vary between 54 km s$^{-1}$ and 483 km s$^{-1}$. We find that the largest absorbers have the highest probability of finding halos. When applying a hierarchical framework, where we allow the largest SBLAs to consume the smaller ones, we find that the halo mass distributions for each SBLA spectral size becomes narrower with respect to the non-hierarchical case. We are also able to probe halo masses from $M_h \approx 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ (for 100 km s$^{-1}$ SBLAs) to $M_h \approx 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$ (for 450 km s$^{-1}$ SBLAs). With these results, we show that we are able to transform the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest into a powerful halo finding machine for not only identifying CGM regions, but also estimating their host halo masses.</description>

      <title>Star Formation Histories of Early-type Dwarfs in Group Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of 983 early-type dwarf galaxies classified into five morphological subtypes, dS0, dE, dEbc, dSph, and dEbl,across six environments ranging from the field to rich clusters such as Ursa Major and Virgo. Using full spectral fitting of SDSS spectra with the starlight code, we derive detailed SFHs and chemical enrichment patterns. We find that SFHs are primarily shaped by morphology, with environment playing a secondary but non-negligible role. Red early-type dwarfs (dS0, dE, dSph) typically formed most of their stars early and quenched rapidly, whereas blue early-type dwarfs (dEbc, dEbl) exhibit extended or ongoing star formation and host extremely metal-poor stars, suggesting continued pristine gas accretion. Environmental dependence is clearest in low-mass systems: field galaxies often show prolonged SFHs and delayed enrichment, while Virgo Cluster galaxies tend to quench earlier and enrich more rapidly. Cumulative SFHs reinforce these trends, with dSph galaxies showing the earliest quenching and least environmental dependence, indicating a likely primordial origin. Metallicity evolution also varies with mass and environment, progressing most slowly in low-mass field galaxies and most rapidly in high-mass cluster galaxies. Our results highlight the combined influence of morphology, stellar mass, and environment on the evolutionary diversity of early-type dwarfs, and suggest that both internal processes (nature) and external conditions (nurture) are intricately linked in shaping their star formation and chemical enrichment histories.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.</description>

      <title>A Multi-frequency Study of the Candidate Double-Double Radio Galaxy J2349-0003 with a Possible Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-frequency analysis of the candidate double-double radio galaxy (DDRG) J2349-0003, exhibiting a possible lobe misalignment. High-resolution uGMRT observations at Bands 3 and 4 reveal a complex radio morphology featuring a pair of inner and outer lobes, and the radio core, while the Band 5 image detects the core and the compact components. The positioning of both pairs of lobes with the central core supports its classification as a DDRG. Spectral age estimates for the inner and outer lobes indicate two distinct episodes of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity interspaced by a short quiescent phase. The possible compact steep spectrum nature of the core, together with its concave spectral curvature, suggests ongoing or recent jet activity, suggesting the possibility that J2349-0003 may be a candidate triple-double radio galaxy. With a projected linear size of 1.08 Mpc, J2349-0003 is classified as a giant radio galaxy (GRG), although its moderate radio power (~10^24 W/Hz) suggests a sparse surrounding environment. Arm-length (R_theta) and flux density ratios (R_S) indicates environmental influences on source symmetry. The observed lobe misalignment and the presence of nearby galaxies in the optical image suggest that merger-driven processes may have played a key role in shaping the source's evolution.</description>

      <title>Additional Evidence for the Existence of a Primordial Disk System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -2.0$) stars on planar orbits has been the subject of great attention since their first discovery. However, prior to the release of the Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra, and large photometric samples such as SkyMapper, SAGES, J-PLUS and S-PLUS, most studies have been limited due to their small sample sizes or strong selection effects. Here, we cross-match photometric metallicities derived from Gaia XP synthetic photometry and geometric distances from Bailer-Jones et al., and select 12,000 VMP stars (1604 dwarfs and 10,396 giants) with available high-quality astrometry. After calculating dynamical parameter estimates using \texttt{AGAMA}, we employ the non-negative matrix factorization technique to the $v_\phi$ distribution across bins in $Z_{\rm max}$ (the maximum height above or below the Galactic plane during the stellar orbit). We find three primary populations of the selected VMP stars: halo, disk system, and the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) structure. The fraction of disk-like stars decreases with increasing $Z_{\rm max}$ (as expected), although it is still $\sim 20$\% for stars with $Z_{\rm max}$ $\sim 3 $ kpc. Similar results emerge from the application of the Hayden criterion, which separates stellar populations on the basis of their orbital inclination angles relative to the Galactic plane. We argue that such high fractions of disk-like stars indicate that they are an independent component, rather than originating solely from Galactic building blocks or heating by minor mergers. We suggest that most of these VMP stars are members of the hypothesized ``primordial" disk.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Accretion Disks in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs), among the universe's most luminous objects, radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are powered by gravitational energy released from material feeding central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, current AGN theory remains largely phenomenological, relying on envisioned structures beyond accretion disks to produce broad optical emission lines (broad line regions, BLRs) and X-ray emission (corona). It struggles to explain accretion disk sizes, optical line diversity, BLR radial inflows/outflows, and crucially, rapid X-ray and optical variability (line width, line shape, inflow/outflow switch, emitting region) on timescales significantly shorter than disk accretion. Here we show that moderately eccentric flows around SMBHs-formed via circumnuclear gas accretion or tidal disruption events-generate eccentricity cascades in the BLRs (from 0.8 to 0.2 outwards), explaining multi-wavelength emission and variability. The flows' non-axisymmetric temperature structures explain dust sublimation asymmetries, different BLR components and their radial motions. The innermost BLR links to the SMBH vicinity through highly eccentric streams producing soft X-rays at periapsis. General relativistic precession further compresses these flows, generating a hard X-ray continuum near the SMBHs. Precession of the eccentric flow drives optical/X-ray variability, reproducing the observed X-ray power spectral density and occasional X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions. We thus propose eccentric accretion disks as a physical AGN model unifying the elusive BLRs and X-ray corona. This model enables detailed anatomy of AGNs and maximises their potential as cosmological standard candles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical traction and black hole orbital migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at the galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body calculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a larger, isotropic isochrone (H\'enon) background potential. When the BH orbits in an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular momentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the kinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its (isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on both the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures. When the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them after they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and migrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less bound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge with the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which may yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre.
  The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the migration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The efficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented (cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a BH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration instability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a threshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a BH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less requires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the BH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.</description>

      <title>Identification of Outer Galaxy Cluster Members Using Gaia DR3 and Multidimensional Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outer Galaxy presents a distinctive environment for investigating star formation. This study develops a novel approach to identify true cluster members based on unsupervised clustering using astrometry with significant uncertainties. As a proof of concept, we analyze three outer Galactic Young Stellar Object (YSO) clusters at different distances and densities within 65 &lt; l &lt; 265 degrees, each known to contain &gt;100 members based on the Star Formation in Outer Galaxy catalog. The 618 YSO clusters in the SFOG dataset were based on 2-dimensional clustering. In this contribution, we apply the HDBSCAN* algorithm to the precise Gaia DR3 astrometry to assign YSO cluster membership. Monte Carlo simulation, coupled with HDBSCAN* (HDBSCAN-MC algorithm), addresses YSO astrometric uncertainties while 5-dimensional clustering. We introduce the Generation Of cLuster anD FIeld STar (GOLDFIST) simulation, to enable robust membership determination, performing an unsupervised clustering analysis in higher-dimensional feature space while accommodating measurement errors. In this study, we extended our approach to distant outer galaxy YSOs and clusters with larger astrometric uncertainties. The results include the discovery of new members in the previously identified clusters. We also analyze the known stars in the clusters and confirm their membership. The derived membership probabilities are included in the provided cluster catalogs. The more accurately predicted simulation distance estimates closely agree, within uncertainty limits, with the median distance estimates derived from Gaia data, and are compared with the kinematic distances from the WISE HII survey.</description>

      <title>How homogeneous was the chemical enrichment of the Milky Way 13 gigayears ago?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyze the chemical composition of the metal-poorest tail of the Galactic halo using highly accurate atmospheric parameters Giribaldi et al. (2021, 2023) and cutting-edge 3D NLTE models Amarsi et al (2018). Most [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagrams in the literature exhibit significant scatter at [Fe/H] $\lesssim -2$ dex, often interpreted as evidence of inhomogeneous enrichment during the early phases of galaxy evolution Rossi et al. (2021). However, our analysis of observational data reveals that in the range $-3.5 &lt;$ [Fe/H] $&lt; -2$ dex, the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] distribution is relatively narrow. This finding suggests a low degree of stochastic enrichment in magnesium during these epochs in the Milky Way halo.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear rings are long-lived structures, allowing the molecular gas inside to become sufficiently dense to initiate star formation. This makes them a crucial element in the study of secular evolution. However, the morphology of nuclear rings, and their potential correlations with that of the galactic hosts, remains an open subject. We examine 52 star-forming nuclear rings from the Atlas of Images of NUclear Rings (AINUR) and correlate the overall galaxy morphology, in particular non-axisymmetric features, with the morphology of the nuclear ring. We define three different classes of nuclear rings: two-armed rings dominated by two dust lanes, twoarms+ rings crowded with secondary dust lanes in addition to the two main ones, and many-armed rings with multiple armlets of similar prevalence. We employ unsharp-masked Hubble Space Telescope images to study the structure of nuclear rings. We find that two-armed rings are more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+ rings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand design and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with later-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In addition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear spirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the nuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host galaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a fundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the nuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg structure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very weak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate cases.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. II. The correlation between SFE and L/M indicator for the evolutionary stages of star-forming clumps in post-processed RMHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of observational indicators ranging from near-IR to radio wavelengths. Among them, the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of their envelope, $L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy.
  Aims. We have developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our suite of simulations.
  Methods. We perform multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of RMHD simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into protostars. We generate synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission from $70$ to $500\ \mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey and at $24\ \mu$m in the MIPSGAL survey, which are then used to build the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3$ mm wavelength in ALMA Band 6 has also been produced for the comparison with observational data. We have applied observational techniques, commonly employed by observers, to the synthetic data, in order to derive the corresponding physical parameters.
  Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.03}}$. This correlation is independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of the simulations in which they formed. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): A Census of Star Formation and Cold Gas Properties in Massive protoclusters at 1.5&lt;z&lt;4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field at z&gt;2. We further show that, instead of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end. Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_{\rm halo}$&gt;8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass assembly in forming cluster cores.</description>

      <title>The Snake Filament: A study of polarization and kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of magnetic fields in the formation of dense filamentary structures in molecular clouds is critical for understanding the star formation process. The Snake filament in or close to the Pipe Nebula s neighboring, a prominent example of such structures, offers an ideal environment to study the interplay between magnetic fields and gas dynamics in the early stages of star formation. This study aims to investigate how magnetic fields influence the structure and dynamics of the Snake filament, using both polarization data and molecular line observations. Our goal is to understand the role of magnetic fields in shaping the filamentary structure and explore the kinematics within the filament. We conducted polarization observations in the optical and near-infrared bands using the 1.6 m and 60 cm telescopes at the Observatorio do Pico dos Dias/Laboratorio Nacional de Astrof\isica (OPD/LNA). Molecular line observations of the C18O and 13CO lines were obtained using the IRAM 30m telescope. We analyzed the data to characterize polarization and gas properties within the filament, with a focus on understanding the magnetic field orientation and its relationship with the filament s structure. Our findings reveal that the polarization vectors align with the filament s spine, indicating a magnetic field structure that is predominantly parallel to the filament at lower-density regions. A velocity gradient along the filament is observed in both C18O and 13CO lines, with C18O tracing the denser regions of the gas. The polarization efficiency decreases with increasing visual extinction, consistent with reduced grain alignment in higher-density regions. The filament s mass-to-length ratio is below the critical value required for gravitational collapse, indicating stability.</description>

      <title>Evolution and star formation history of NGC300 from a chemical evolution model with radial gas inflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the build-up of galactic discs gas infall is an important ingredient and it produces radial gas inflows as a physical consequence of angular momentum conservation, since the infalling gas on to the disc at a specific radius has lower angular momentum than the circular motions of the gas at the point of impact. NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy ideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas inflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical properties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by assuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and outflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the model. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc formation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase and stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow velocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and metallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas inflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted present-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300. It predicts a significant flattening of the metallicity gradient with cosmic time. We also find that the model predicted star formation has been more active recently, indicating that the radial gas inflows may be help to sustain star formation in local spirals, at least in NGC300.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Methods for Very Large Astrometric Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for inferring smooth models of the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor of the Milky Way from astrometric data. Our approach is based on Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process Regression (SVGPR) and provides an attractive alternative to binning procedures. SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which suffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently distributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements exhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property of the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes. This achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M &lt;&lt; N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data. Applied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity Survey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find asymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a state of disequilibrium. Furthermore, our dispersion profiles exhibit correlated structures at several locations in |z|, which we interpret as signatures of the Gaia phase spiral. These results demonstrate that our method provides a promising direction for data-driven analyses of Galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase Elemental abundances in Molecular cloudS (GEMS) XI. The evolution of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ isotopic ratios in starless cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopic ratios have been used as chemical diagnostics to investigate the origin of the material in the Solar System. We have determined the HCN, HNC, and N2H+ isotopic ratios and the chemical age in a large sample of 23 starless cores located in different environments. This work uses IRAM 30m data to constrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of HCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code DNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores, with average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\pm$0.019, 0.036$\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions (Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that reflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a significant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed values with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The 14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\pm$120) and HNC/H15NC (296$\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the deuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The Dfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless cores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N and HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the detected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The average value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than the values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating that nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar phase.</description>

      <title>The Complex Multi-Wavelength Morphology of the Peculiar Compact Galaxy Group IC 2431</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Chandra X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the compact galaxy group IC 2431, and compare with archival ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio images. IC 2431 is a starburst system containing three tidally-distorted disk galaxies. All three galaxies may have active nuclei. One galaxy is classified as an AGN based on its optical spectrum, a second is identified as a possible X-ray AGN based on the Chandra data, and the third galaxy may host a radio AGN. In optical images, a prominent dust lane crosses the southern galaxy, while Spitzer infrared images show a dusty bridge connecting the two brightest galaxies. Chandra maps reveal a massive (2 x 10^7 M(sun)) concentration of hot gas between these two galaxies, as well as several other knots of hot gas and non-thermal emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of the hot gas in IC 2431 is ~ 1 x 10^42 erg/s, which is enhanced by about a factor of four relative to the star formation rate, compared to other star-forming galaxies. In radio maps, a bright jet/ridge of radio continuum emission extends 4 kpc from one nucleus. We compare the properties of IC 2431 with those of other interacting galaxy systems, and discuss two different scenarios that may account for the peculiarities of IC 2431: ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium during a head-on collision between two galaxies, or an AGN-powered radio jet that has been distorted by an interaction with interstellar gas during a tidal encounter between galaxies.</description>

      <title>Very bright, very blue, and very red: JWST CAPERS analysis of highly luminous galaxies with extreme UV slopes at $\mathbf{z = 10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of three luminous ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-20$) galaxies at $z\sim10$ observed with the CAPERS Cycle 3 program. These galaxies exhibit extreme UV slopes compared to typical galaxies at $z=10$. Of the three sources, two of them are a close pair (0.22 - arcsec) of blue galaxies at $z=9.800\pm0.003$ and $z=9.808\pm0.002$ with UV slopes of $\beta=-2.87\pm0.15$ and $\beta=-2.46\pm0.10$ respectively, selected from PRIMER COSMOS NIRCam imaging. We perform spectrophotometric modeling of the galaxies which suggests extremely young stellar ages and a lack of dust attenuation. For the bluest galaxy, its UV slope also suggests significant Lyman continuum escape. In contrast, the third source (selected from CEERS NIRCam imaging) at $z=9.942\pm0.002$ exhibits a red UV slope with $\beta=-1.51\pm0.08$. We rule out the possibility of a strong nebular continuum due to the lack of a Balmer jump and find no evidence to support the presence of active galactic nucleus continuum due to a lack of strong UV emission lines and no broad component to H$\gamma$ or H$\beta$. Instead, it is most likely that the red UV slope is due to dust-reddening ($A_{\rm V}\simeq0.9$) implying a significant level of dust-obscured star-formation only $\simeq480\, \rm Myr$ after the Big Bang. Under standard assumptions for dust attenuation, EGS-25297 would be the most intrinsically UV-luminous galaxy ($M_{\mathrm{UV,corr}}\simeq -22.4^{+0.7}_{-1.1}$) yet spectroscopically confirmed at $z \sim 10$. This work highlights that luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ have a diversity of dust properties and that spectroscopy of these galaxies is essential to fully understand star-formation at $z\gtrsim10$.</description>

      <title>Observational biases on rotation curves from IFU data at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through studying rotation curves, which depict how the velocity of the stars and gas changes with distance from the center of the galaxy, it has been confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxy's outer regions, as their rotation curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point, suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \approx 0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \approx 2.2$. By comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$ galaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more disturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when in reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised when using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the gravitational potential of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Investigating Galactic Fountains in M101: Insights from Ionized, UV emissions and Neutral Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation, self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10 Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at 100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer. We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$ and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94 Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.</description>

      <title>Angular-momentum pairs in spherical systems: applications to the Galactic centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems objects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli, represented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the persistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This process, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes which change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between objects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show that nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in angular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an external massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to the Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the angular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the perturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance. Angular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will remain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any external influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive perturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts, including galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre, globular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a central super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young, massive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to constrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the nearby gaseous torus.</description>

      <title>The astrophysical $S-$factor and reaction rate for $^{15}$N($p,\gamma$)$^{16}$O within the modified potential cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14680v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a radiative $p^{15}$N capture on the ground state of $^{16}$O at stellar energies within the framework of a modified potential cluster model (MPCM) with forbidden states, including low-lying resonances. The investigation of the $^{15}$N($p,\gamma _{0}$)$^{16}$O reaction includes the consideration of $^{3}S_{1}$ resonances due to $E1$ transitions and the contribution of $^{3}P_{1}$ scattering wave in $p$ + $^{15}$N channel due to $^{3}P_{1}\longrightarrow $ $^{3}P_{0}$ $M1$ transition. We calculated the astrophysical low-energy $S-$factor, and extrapolated $S(0)$ turned out to be within $34.7-40.4$ keV$\cdot $b. The important role of the asymptotic constant (AC) for the $^{15}$N($p,\gamma _{0}$)$^{16}$O process with interfering $^{3}S_{1}$(312) and $^{3}S_{1}$(962) resonances is elucidated. A comparison of our calculation for $S-$factor with existing experimental and theoretical data is addressed, and a reasonable agreement is found.
  The reaction rate is calculated and compared with the existing rates. It has negligible dependence on the variation of AC, but shows a strong impact of the interference of $^{3}S_{1}$(312) and $^{3}S_{1}$(962) resonances, especially at temperatures, referring to the CNO Gamow windows. We estimate the contribution of cascade transitions to the reaction rate based on the exclusive experimental data by \textit{Imbriani, et al. 2012}. The reaction rate enhancement due to the cascade transitions is observed from $T_{9} &gt; 0.3 $ and reaches the maximum factor $\sim $\ 1.3 at $T_{9}=1.3$.
  We present the Gamow energy window and a comparison of rates for radiative proton capture reactions $^{12}$N($p,\gamma $)$^{13}$O, $^{13}$N($p,\gamma $) $^{14}$O, $^{14}$N($p,\gamma $)$^{15}$O, and $^{15}$N($p,\gamma $)$^{16}$O obtained in the framework of the MPCM and give temperature windows, prevalence, and significance of each process.</description>

      <title>SLICE: SPT-CL J0546-5345 -- A prominent strong-lensing cluster at $z=1.07$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive galaxy clusters act as prominent strong-lenses. Due to a combination of observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the known cluster lenses lie typically at $z_{l}\sim0.2-0.7$, with only a few prominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift $z_l=1.07$. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of $M_{200,c} = (7.95 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST imaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged background galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the cluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of $\theta_{E}= 18.1 \pm 1.8 ''$ for a source at $z_{s}=3$, and $\theta_{E}= 27.9 \pm 2.8 ''$ for a source at $z_{s}=9$. The total projected mass within a $200$ kpc radius around the strong-lensing region is $M(&lt;200\,\mathrm{kpc}) = (1.9 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. While our results rely on photometric redshifts warranting spectroscopic follow-up, this central mass resembles that of the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters - although SPT-CL J0546-5345 is observed when the Universe was $\sim 3-4$ Gyr younger. Amongst the multiply-imaged sources, we identify a hyperbolic-umbilic-like configuration, and, thanks to its point-like morphology, a possible Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). If confirmed spectroscopically, it will add to just a handful of other quasars and AGN known to be multiply lensed by galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Free Floating or Merely Detached?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microlensing surveys suggest the presence of a surprisingly large population of free-floating planets, with a rate of about two Neptunes per star. The origin of such objects is not known, neither do we know if they are truly unbound or are merely orbiting at large separations from their host stars. Here, we investigate planet-planet scattering as a possible origin through numerical simulations of unstable multi-planet systems. We find that planet ejection by scattering can be slow, often taking more than billions of years for Neptune-mass scatterers orbiting at a few AU and beyond. Moreover, this process invariably delivers planets to orbits of hundreds of AU that are protected from further scattering. We call these ``detached" planets. Under the scattering hypothesis, we estimate that about half of the reported ``free-floating" Neptunes are not free but merely ``detached".</description>

      <title>Bringing the Norma Dark Cloud to Light in X-rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not. Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma dark cloud.</description>

      <title>Magnification bias reveals severe contamination in Hubble Frontier Field photo-z catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters enables faint distant galaxies to be more abundantly detected than in blank fields, thereby allowing one to construct galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) to an unprecedented depth at high redshifts. Intriguingly, photometric redshift catalogs (e.g. Shipley et al. (2018)) constructed from the Hubble Frontier Fields survey display an excess of z$\gtrsim$4 galaxies in the cluster lensing fields and are not seen in accompanying blank parallel fields. The observed excess, while maybe a gift of gravitational lensing, could also be from misidentified low-z contaminants having similar spectral energy distributions as high-z galaxies. In the latter case, the contaminants may result in nonphysical turn-ups in UV LFs and/or wash out faint end turnovers predicted by contender cosmological models to $\Lambda$CDM. Here, we employ the concept of magnification bias to perform the first statistical estimation of contamination levels in HFF lensing field photometric redshift catalogs. To our great worry, while we were able to reproduce a lower-z lensed sample, it was found $\sim56\%$ of $3.5 &lt; z_{phot} &lt; 5.5$ samples are likely low-z contaminants! Widely adopted Lyman Break Galaxy-like selection rules in literature may give a 'cleaner' sample magnification bias-wise but we warn readers the resulting sample would also be less complete. Individual mitigation of the contaminants is arguably the best way for the investigation of faint high-z Universe, and this may be made possible with JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Leaky dust trap in the PDS 70 disk revealed by ALMA Band 9 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new observations of the PDS 70 disc obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 9 (671 GHz) at 0.242$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, which provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of sub-millimetre grains in the disc. The data reveal a ring-like morphology, with a radial peak located between those previously observed at infrared wavelengths and longer millimetre observations. Additionally, we detect a tentative outer shoulder in Band 9 that is not observed at longer wavelengths. These findings suggest that small grains ($\sim 100 \mu$m) traced by Band 9 may be escaping from the pressure bump both radially inwards and outwards, or may be tracing different disc layers than those probed at longer wavelengths. A multi-wavelength analysis of the disc at millimetre wavelengths and the best fit to the spectral energy distribution shows the presence of centimetre grains around the ring location, where the dust surface density also peaks, compatible with dust trap models. The grain size in the disc cavity is not well constrained but is consistent with grains as small as 10 $\mu$m, supporting the hypothesis that small dust grain filters through the cavity. We use dust evolution models to demonstrate that a turbulent viscosity of $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ allows small grains to filter through the disc gap, while $\alpha \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ is required to retain large grains in the pressure bump. The Band 9 observations of PDS 70 validate theoretical models and confirm the presence of pebble flux through the disc gap.</description>

      <title>Millions of Main-Sequence Binary Stars from Gaia BP/RP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between 0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35 million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large, homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates, improving our understanding of compact object populations.</description>

      <title>A population analysis of Galactic Miras with light-curve asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: In a recent publication, we established a close relationship between light-curve asymmetries in Mira variables and indicators of their dust mass-loss rate. The light-curve asymmetries appear to be related to the stars' third dredge-up (3DUP) activity. Aims: We aim to reveal the evolutionary status of M-type Miras with light-curve asymmetries ('bumps') within the spectral sequence M -- S -- C, determine their mass-loss properties, and check possible evolutionary scenarios. Methods: We analysed a sample of 3100 Miras collected from the ASAS database, distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric light curves. We determined their periods, luminosity functions, and period-luminosity relations, their locations relative to the Galactic midplane, as well as mass-loss rate indicators through the 2MASS-WISE colours and the Gaia-2MASS diagram. Results: The M-type Miras with symmetric light curves are generally found to have shorter periods, lower luminosities, a larger average distance to the Galactic midplane, and lower initial masses than the M-type Miras with asymmetries. In addition, 25 Miras are proposed as candidates for new carbon stars. Conclusions: We propose that the M-type Miras have two distinct populations: M-type Miras with symmetric light curves, which have lower initial mass progenitors than M-type Miras with asymmetries, which show signs of 3DUP activity and are the link to the S-type Miras.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Intrinsic Galaxy Alignments in Ellipticity Autocorrelations out to $100 h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$ from SDSS Galaxies with DESI Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the autocorrelation of galaxy shapes, the so-called intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation is important for both cosmology and understanding the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. However, such measurements are significantly more challenging than the cross-correlation with galaxy density (GI correlation) due to the much lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we report the first observational evidence for large-scale intrinsic alignments measured from the ellipticity autocorrelations, extending out to $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. From SDSS and SDSS-III BOSS, we analyze over the redshift range $0.16\leq z\leq 0.70$ luminous red galaxies (LRG), LOWZ and CMASS galaxy samples, the latter two of which are cross-matched with high-quality DESI imaging data. By expanding one of the two II correlation functions, II($-$), in terms of the associated Legendre polynomials, we effectively isolate the line-of-sight projection effects and enhance the signal. The resulting correlation for all three samples exhibits a clear power-law form. We also show that combining the two II correlations, II($+$) and II($-$), increases the detection significance by $\sim 10\%$, though they appear equivalent mathematically under the linear alignment model. Importantly, this measurement opens a new observational window for probing signals uniquely encoded in shape autocorrelations, such as tensor perturbations from the gravitational waves. This analysis establishes a practical framework for probing such effects.</description>

      <title>Novel Challenges in Tracking Self-Interacting Dark Matter Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Dark Energy from DESI DR2 with CMB and SNIa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast, combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Stellar Mass Predictions from Broad-Band Magnitudes with a Simple Neural Network: Application to Simulated Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10046</link>

Abstract: A simple, fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer is used to estimate stellar masses for star-forming galaxies. The model is trained on broad-band photometry - from far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths - generated by the Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation (SHARK), along with derived colour indices. It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses with respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex over the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's parameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective predictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a strong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to account for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing the diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy distribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally expensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In contrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables, enabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational cost. The model derives its predictions exclusively from patterns learned in the data, without any built-in physical assumptions (such as stellar initial mass function). These results demonstrate the utility of this study's machine learning approach in astrophysical parameter estimation and highlight its potential to complement conventional techniques in upcoming large galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>A study of newly discovered close binary open clusters in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the release of Gaia data, the number of known Galactic open clusters (OCs) has increased rapidly, providing an excellent opportunity to confirm more binary open clusters in the Milky Way. Using a recently released OC catalogue, we employed the photometric and astrometric data of OCs and their member stars to find close binary open clusters (CBOCs). The three dimensional spatial coordinates, proper motions, and colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are used for identifying candidate CBOCs. The fundamental parameters of 26 star clusters are determined by fitting CMDs to stellar population isochrones, to check the similarity of reddenings, ages and metallicities of the sub-clusters of candidate CBOCs. The virial equilibrium is then used to exclude fake CBOCs including unbound moving groups. To further confirm the binary nature of the CBOC candidates, we calculated their Roche radii and orbital parameters. The tidal radius and radial velocity difference are then compared to the Roche radius and orbital velocity respectively, to find out gravitationally bound pairs. We identified nine new CBOC candidates from bound candidate open clusters, seven of which are shown to be candidates for primordial binary open clusters (PBOCs). However, only the pair CWNU 1024 and OCSN 82 is identified as a gravitationally bound CBOC, when considering the uncertainties. The other eight CBOC candidates appear to be gravitationally unbound pairs, but the results depend on the methods of tidal radius determination and gravitational binding examination.</description>

      <title>Galactic Trajectories of Interstellar Objects 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/Atlas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov and 3I/ATLAS, were discovered over the past decade. We follow the trajectories of known interstellar objects in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy to constrain their possible origin. We initiate the trajectories based on the measured velocities of the interstellar objects relative to the Local Standard of Rest. Since the scale-height of stars in the Milky-Way disk increases with age, we use the vertical excursion of each interstellar object from the Milky-Way disk mid-plane to constrain their likely age. The small vertical extent of 1I/`Oumuamua's past trajectory suggests that it originated near the mid-plane of the thin Galactic disk of stars, implying a likely age younger than 1--2 Gyr. The maximal excursion of the comet 2I/Borisov is similar to that of the Sun, suggesting a similar age. The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exhibits significantly larger vertical excursions, with z_max = 0.475, suggesting that it originated from an older source population in the thick Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simulations and Observations: New Insights into Galaxy Formation Simulations via Out-of-Distribution Detection and Bayesian Model Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6 hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification, identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial explanations through SHAP values.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Feedback from Supernovae in a Parker-Unstable Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova energy drives interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence and can help launch galactic winds. What difference does it make if $10\%$ of the energy is initially deposited into cosmic rays? To answer this question and study cosmic-ray feedback, we perform galactic patch simulations of a stratified ISM. We compare two magnetohydrodynamic and cosmic ray (MHD+CR) simulations, which are identical except for how each supernova's energy is injected. In one, $10\%$ of the energy is injected as cosmic-ray energy. In the other case, energy injection is strictly thermal and kinetic. We find that cosmic-ray injections drive a faster, hotter, and more massive outflow long after the injections occur. Both simulations show the formation of cold clouds (with a total mass fraction $&gt;50\%$) through the Parker instability and thermal instability. The Parker instability simultaneously produces high mass loading factors $\eta &gt; 10^3$ as it requires few supernovae. We also show how the Parker instability naturally leads to a decorrelation of cosmic-ray pressure and gas density. This decorrelation leads to a significant decrease in the calorimetric fraction for injected cosmic rays, but it depends on having a highly resolved magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a 36 Billion Solar Mass Black Hole at the Centre of the Cosmic Horseshoe Gravitational Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centre of every massive galaxy, with their masses tightly connected to their host galaxies through a co-evolution over cosmic time. For massive ellipticals, the SMBH mass ($M_\text{BH}$) strongly correlates with the central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_e$), via the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation. However, SMBH mass measurements have traditionally relied on central stellar dynamics in nearby galaxies ($z &lt; 0.1$), limiting our ability to explore the SMBHs across cosmic time. In this work, we present a self-consistent analysis combining 2D stellar dynamics and lens modelling of the Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lens system ($z = 0.44$), one of the most massive galaxies ever observed. Using integral-field spectroscopic data from MUSE and high-resolution imaging from HST, we model the radial arc and stellar kinematics, constraining the galaxy's central mass distribution and SMBH mass. Bayesian model comparison yields a $5\sigma$ detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with $\log_{10}(M_\text{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 10.56^{+0.07}_{-0.08} \pm (0.12)^\text{sys}$, consistent across various systematic tests. Our findings place the Cosmic Horseshoe $\sim$$1.5\sigma$ above the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation, supporting an emerging trend observed in BGCs and other massive galaxies. This suggests a steeper $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relationship at the highest masses, potentially driven by a different co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. Future surveys will uncover more radial arcs, enabling the detection of SMBHs over a broader redshift and mass range. These discoveries will further refine our understanding of the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation and its evolution across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent JWST Census of Star Formation and AGN activity at z=5.5-13.5</title>

Abstract: The cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and cosmic active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history (CAGNH) are self consistently measured at $z = 5.5-13.5$. This is achieved by analyzing galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope from $\approx 400 \, \mathrm{arcmin^{2}}$ fields from the PEARLS, CEERS, NGDEEP, JADES and PRIMER surveys. In particular, the combination of spectral energy distribution fitting codes, EAZY and \textsc{ProSpect}, are employed to estimate the photometric redshifts and astrophysical quantities of $3751$ distant galaxies, from which we compute the stellar mass, star formation rate and AGN luminosity distribution functions in four redshift bins. Integrating the distribution functions, we find that the CSFH rises by $\approx 1$~dex over $z = 13.5 - 5.5$ and the CAGNH rises by $\approx 1$~dex over $z = 10.5 - 5.5$. We connect our results of the CSFH and CAGNH at $z=13.5-5.5$ to that from $z= 5-0$ to determine the summary of $\gtrsim 13$ Gyr of star formation and AGN activity, from the very onset of galaxy formation to the present day.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies is particularly challenging due to projection effects and the unknown shape of their velocity anisotropy profile. Our goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of recovering dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies from line-of-sight stellar data. Traditionally, this task relies on time-consuming methods that require profile parameterization and assume dynamical equilibrium and spherical symmetry. We train a convolutional neural network model using various sets of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. By extracting projected stellar data from the simulated galaxies and feeding it into the model, we obtain the posterior distribution of the dynamical mass profile at ten different radii. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of existing literature mass estimators on our dataset. Our model achieves more accurate results than any literature mass estimator while also providing enclosed mass estimates at radii where no previous estimators exist. We confirm that the posterior distributions produced by the model are well-calibrated, ensuring they provide meaningful uncertainties. However, issues remain, as the method loses performance when trained on one set of simulations and applied to another, highlighting the importance of improving the generalization of ML methods trained on specific galaxy simulations.</description>

      <title>The MASSIVE Survey. XX. A Triaxial Stellar Dynamical Measurement of the Supermassive Black Hole Mass and Intrinsic Galaxy Shape of Giant Radio Galaxy NGC 315</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole mass and intrinsic shape of the stellar halo of the massive radio galaxy NGC 315 as part of the MASSIVE survey. High signal-to-noise ratio spectra from integral-field spectrographs at the Gemini and McDonald Observatories provide stellar kinematic measurements in $304$ spatial bins from the central ${\sim}0.3''$ out to $30''$. Using ${\sim} 2300$ kinematic constraints, we perform triaxial stellar orbit modeling with the TriOS code and search over ${\sim}$15,000 galaxy models with a Bayesian scheme to simultaneously measure six mass and intrinsic shape parameters. NGC 315 is triaxial and highly prolate, with middle-to-long and short-to-long axis ratios of $p=0.854$ and $q=0.833$ and a triaxiality parameter of $T=0.89$. The black hole mass inferred from our stellar kinematics is $M_\mathrm{BH} = \left(3.0 {\pm} 0.3\right) {\times} 10^{9}\ M_\odot$, which is higher than $M_\mathrm{BH}=(1.96^{+0.30}_{-0.13}) {\times} 10^{9} M_\odot$ inferred from CO kinematics (scaled to our distance). When the seven galaxies with $M_\mathrm{BH}$ measurements from both stellar and CO kinematics are compared, we find an intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex in $M_\mathrm{BH}$ from the two tracers and do not detect statistically significant biases between the two methods in the current data. The implied black hole shadow size (${\approx} 4.7\, \mu{\rm as}$) and the relatively high millimeter flux of NGC 315 makes this galaxy a prime candidate for future horizon-size imaging studies.</description>

      <title>Recovering the pattern speeds of edge-on barred galaxies via an orbit-superposition method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies and evaluated its capability to recover the bar pattern speed $\rm\Omega_p$. We selected three simulated galaxies (Au-18, Au-23, and Au-28) with known pattern speeds from the Auriga simulations and created MUSE-like mock data sets with edge-on views (inclination angles $\theta_{\rm T}\ge85^\circ$) and various bar azimuthal angles $\varphi_{\rm T}$. For mock data sets with side-on bars ($\varphi_{\rm T}\ge50^\circ$), the model-recovered pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_p$ encompass the true pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_T$ within the model uncertainties ($1\sigma$ confidence levels, $68\%$) for 10 of 12 cases. The average model uncertainty within the $1\sigma$ confidence levels is equal to $10\%$. For mock data sets with end-on bars ($\varphi_{\rm T}\le30^\circ$), the model uncertainties of $\rm\Omega_p$ depend significantly on the bar azimuthal angles $\varphi_{\rm T}$, with the uncertainties of cases with $\varphi_{\rm T}=10^\circ$ approaching $\sim30\%$. However, by imposing a stricter constraint on the bar morphology ($p_{\rm bar}\le0.50$), the average uncertainties are reduced to $14\%$ , and $\rm\Omega_p$ still encompass $\rm\Omega_T$ within the model uncertainties for three of four cases. For all the models that we create in this paper, the $2\sigma$ ($95\%$) confidence levels of the model-recovered pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_p$ always cover the true values $\rm\Omega_T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of stars is governed by the intricate interplay of nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects, gravity, and turbulence. Computational challenges have hindered a comprehensive 3D exploration of this interplay, posing a longstanding challenge in our understanding of clouds and cores. Our objective was to study the spatial features and time evolution of the neutral-ion drift velocity and the mass-to-flux ratio in a 3D nonideal MHD chemo-dynamical simulation of a supercritical turbulent collapsing molecular cloud. The resistivities of the cloud were computed self-consistently from a vast non-equilibrium chemical network containing 115 species. To compute the resistivities we used different mean collisional rates for each charged species in our network. We additionally developed a new generalized method for measuring the true mass-to-flux ratio in 3D simulations. Despite the cloud's turbulent nature, at early times, the neutral-ion drift velocity follows the expected structure from 2D axisymmetric non-ideal MHD simulations with an hourglass magnetic field. At later times, however, the neutral-ion drift velocity becomes increasingly complex, with many vectors pointing outward from the cloud's center. Specifically, we find that the drift velocity above and below the cloud's ``midplane'' is in ``antiphase''. We explain these features on the basis of magnetic helical loops and the correlation of the drift velocity with the magnetic tension force per unit volume. Despite the complex structure of the neutral-ion drift velocity, we demonstrate that, when averaged over a region, the true mass-to-flux ratio monotonically increases as a function of time and decreases as a function of the radius from the center of the cloud. In contrast, the ``observed'' mass-to-flux ratio shows poor correlation with the true mass-to-flux ratio and the density structure of the cloud.</description>

      <title>Gas-Poor Hosts and Gas-Rich Companions of $z\approx$3.5 Radio Active Galactic Nuclei: ALMA Insights into Jet Triggering and Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold gaseous systems play important roles in galaxy evolution by possibly providing fuel to ignite active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and star-formation. In this work, we analyze [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ and continuum observations from ALMA for a sample of four radio AGN at $z \approx 3.5$, focusing on eight associated companion cloud systems discovered within projected distances of tens of kiloparsecs or less. The spatial distribution of these companions indicates that the majority of cold gas is not located at the AGN position, i.e., not in their host galaxies. With the assistance of [CII] at $0.2"$ resolution, we further confirm the gas-poor nature of the hosts by re-analyzing archival [CI] (a tracer of H$_{2}$) at $\sim2"$ resolution. Our sample has [CII] luminosities in a range of $2.8\times10^{8}&lt;L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\odot}&lt;4.2\times10^{9}$. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm IR}$ ratio, $\sim 9.4\times10^{-4}$, is consistent with sources discussed in the literature. Our findings show the gas-poor radio AGN hosts have nearby gas-rich companions. We propose that these companions may be stripped clouds resulting from merger processes, which could be a trigger of radio-loud AGN. They may also be a signature of negative AGN feedback (e.g., shock heating) on these infalling companions and on the host galaxy. In general, our analysis shows that powerful AGN at and before Cosmic Noon are impacting and being impacted by cold gaseous clouds in their circumgalactic or protointracluster media.</description>

      <title>Direct Collapse Pre-supermassive Black Hole Objects as Ly$\alpha$ Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Direct Collapse scenario to form the supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds offers the most promising way to explain the origin of quasars at $z&gt;7$. Assuming atomic primordial gas, can Ly$\alpha$ photons escape from the central regions of the collapse and serve as a diagnostic for the detection of these pre-SMBH objects? Models of spherical collapse have found these photons to be trapped and destroyed. We use Ly$\alpha$ radiation transfer within the inflow-outflow geometry, based on earlier zoom-in cosmological modeling involving radiation transfer and magnetic forces. Adopting geometry that includes ongoing disk and spherical accretion, and formation of a biconical outflow funnel, we obtain the formation of a dense radiatively driven expanding shell. The Ly$\alpha$ transfer is performed using a Monte Carlo algorithm, accounting for the destruction of Ly$\alpha$ photons and the emergence of two-photon emission. We find that a substantial fraction of Ly$\alpha$ photons can escape through the funnel and calculate the line profiles, the line peak velocity shift, asymmetry, and cuspiness, by varying basic model parameters. The escaping Ly$\alpha$ emission is anisotropic and sensitive to the overall inflow-outflow geometry. The escaping fraction of Ly$\alpha$ radiation exceeds 95% from a $z=10$ pre-SMBH object -- in principle detectable by the JWST NIRSpec in the MOS mode, during $\sim 10^4$ seconds for a $10\sigma$ signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, comparisons with line shapes from high-$z$ galaxies and quasars allow us to separate them from pre-SMBH objects based on the line shape: the pre-SMBH lines show a profound asymmetry and extended red tail.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Torques from a Lopsided Young Stellar Component Sustain High Black Hole Accretion Rates in NGC 4593</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow primarily through gas accretion, observed as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While mergers can drive luminous AGN episodes, secular processes may fuel a substantial portion of cosmic BH growth. Whether these mechanisms can sustain high BH accretion rates remains uncertain. This study aims to identify the secular mechanism driving high BH accretion rates, by targeting a galaxy with moderately massive SMBH, high central gas densities, accretion rates of a few percent of the Eddington limit, and gas kinematics resolved close to black hole-dominated scales. A blind search led to the identification of NGC 4593, which is representative of the AGN population driving BH mass density growth since $z=1$. A prominent single-arm ("$m=1$") molecular gas spiral with ${\rm log}\,M_{\rm mol}/{\rm M}_\odot=8.1\pm0.3$ extends from 1.3$\,$kpc down to the SMBH's sphere of influence ($1.7^{+0.5}_{-0.2}\,{\rm pc}$). Star formation in the spiral is inefficient (${\rm SFR} = 4.9 \times 10^{-2} \,{\rm M}_\odot {\rm /yr}$, $\langle t_{\rm dep}\rangle=3.9 \pm 0.6\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas inflow rate exceeds the SFR by two orders of magnitude and is sufficient to sustain the current BH accretion rate for $\geq$35$\,$Myr, enabling $\sim$10% SMBH growth. A young, lopsided stellar component (${\rm log}\,M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot=7.5-9.3$) exerts torques on the molecular gas, likely driving the gas inflow. This young stellar component may serve as both a cause and a product of sustained gas funnelling towards the SMBH. These findings provide evidence for the sustained secular $m=1$ feeding mode at high BH accretion rates, linking kpc-scale gas dynamics to the black hole's sphere of influence. This mechanism, consistent with simulation predictions, may represent a key contributor to SMBH growth in luminous AGNs since cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Open cluster members in APOGEE DR17 I. Dynamics and star members</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Open clusters (OCs) are groups of stars formed from the same cloud of gas and cosmic dust. They play an important role in studies of star formation and evolution and our understanding of galaxy structure and dynamics. Aims. The main objective of this work is to identify stars that belong to OCs using astrometric data from Gaia EDR3 and spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17. Furthermore, we investigate the metallicity gradients and orbital properties of the OCs in our sample. Methods. By applying the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to these data, we identified observed stars in our galaxy with similar dynamics, chemical compositions, and ages. The orbits of the OCs were also calculated using the GravPot16 code. Results. We find 1,987 stars that tentatively belong to 49 OCs; 941 of these stars have probabilities above 80 \% of belonging to OCs. Our metallicity gradient presents a two-slope shape for two measures of different Galactic center distances -- the projected Galactocentric distance and the guiding center radius to the Galactic center -- as already reported in previous work. However, when we separate the OCs by age, we observe no significant difference in the metallicity gradient slope beyond a certain distance from the Galactic center. Our results show a shallower gradient for clusters younger than 2 Gyr than those older than 2 Gyr. All our OCs dynamically assemble the disk-like population very well, and they are in prograde orbits, which is typical for disk-like populations. Some OCs resonate with the Galactic bar at the Lagrange points L4 and L5.</description>

      <title>The JWST Spectroscopic Properties of Galaxies at $z=9-14$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the JWST spectra of $61$ galaxies at $z=9-14$, including $30$ newly-confirmed galaxies. We directly compare the $z&gt;9$ spectroscopic properties against $401$ galaxies at $6&lt;z&lt;9$, with the goal of identifying evolution in the star formation histories and ISM. We measure rest-UV emission line properties and UV continuum slopes, while also investigating the rest-optical emission lines for the subset of galaxies at $9.0&lt;z&lt;9.6$. With these spectra, we constrain the stellar masses, specific star formation rates, dust attenuation, and the average metallicity and abundance pattern of $z&gt;9$ galaxies. Our dataset indicates that the emission lines undergo a marked change at $z&gt;9$, with extremely large CIII], H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$ EWs becoming $2-3\times$ more common at $z&gt;9$ relative to $6&lt;z&lt;9$. Using the spectra, we infer the distribution of SFRs on short (SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$) and medium (SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$) timescales, finding that rapid SFR upturns (large SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$ ratios) are significantly more likely among $z&gt;9$ galaxies. These results may reflect a larger dispersion in UV luminosity at fixed halo mass and larger baryon accretion rates at $z&gt;9$, although other physical effects may also contribute. We suggest that the shift in star formation conditions explains the prevalence of extreme nebular spectra that have been detected at $z&gt;9$, with hard ionizing sources and nitrogen-enhancements becoming more typical at the highest redshifts. Finally, we identify five $z&gt;9$ spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with red UV colors ($\beta\gtrsim-1.5$), either revealing a small population with moderate dust attenuation ($\tau_V=0.23-0.35$) or very high density nebular-dominated galaxies with hot stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of relativistic charged particles and field lines in isotropic turbulence: I. Numerical simulations</title>

Abstract: The transport of non-thermal particles across a large-scale magnetic field in the presence of magnetised turbulence has been a long-standing issue in high-energy astrophysics. Of particular interest is the dependence of the parallel and perpendicular mean free paths $\lambda_{\parallel}$ and $\lambda_{\perp}$ on rigidity $\mathcal{R}$. We have revisited this important issue with a view to applications from the transport of Galactic cosmic rays to acceleration at astrophysical shocks. We have run test particle simulations of cosmic ray transport in synthetic, isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence at unprecedentedly low reduced rigidities $\rg/\Lc \simeq 10^{-4}$, corresponding to $\mathcal{R} \simeq 10 \, \text{TV}$ for a turbulent magnetic field of $\Brms = 4 \, \mu\text{G}$ and correlation length $\Lc = 30 \, \text{pc}$. Extracting the (asymptotic) parallel and perpendicular mean free paths $\lambda_{\parallel}$ and $\lambda_{\perp}$, we have found $\lambda_{\parallel} \propto (\rg/\Lc)^{1/3}$ as expected for a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum. In contrast, $\lambda_{\perp}$ has a faster dependence on $\rg/\Lc$ for $10^{-2} \lesssim \rg/\Lc \lesssim 1$, but for $\rg/\Lc \ll 10^{-2}$, also $\lambda_{\perp} \propto (\rg/\Lc)^{1/3}$. Our results have important implications for the transport of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of high-energy particles in the presence of small-scale, turbulent magnetic fields is a long-standing issue in astrophysics. Analytical theories on transport perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field disagree with numerical simulations at rigidities where the particles' gyroradii are slightly smaller than the correlation length of turbulence. At the same time, extending the numerical simulations to lower rigidities has proven computationally prohibitive. We present an analytical model for the perpendicular transport, based on (1) initial particle transport along field lines, (2) the transport of field lines and (3) the eventual decorrelation of particles from field lines. Transport parallel to the large-scale field is governed by pitch-angle scattering and so for times larger than the inverse pitch-angle diffusion coefficient, particles spatially diffuse in the parallel direction. Our results suggest that perpendicular diffusion occurs when particles have displaced in the perpendicular direction by a few correlation lengths of turbulence. We have tested the analytical theory by running a large suite of test particle simulations at unprecedentedly low rigidities, making extensive use of graphical processing units (GPUs). Our numerical results exhibit a non-standard rigidity-dependence for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient at intermediate rigidities. At the lowest rigidities, the standard rigidity-dependence is recovered. The simulated diffusion coefficients are nicely reproduced by our analytical model. We have traced the non-standard rigidity-dependence to a subdiffusive phase in the field line transport. Our study confirms our understanding of the escape of cosmic rays from the Galactic halo and its rigidity-dependence. [abridged]</description>

      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional data into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python/Cython implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask and weighting scheme. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed" estimators and their idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration using JAX. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization structures
  in the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$ decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend. Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. \textbf{We obtained B,V, R, I, g, r, i, and z photometry with the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory 1.88-m telescope, the Palomar 200-inch telescope, and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope on 2024 July 2, 3, and 6. We measured colour indices B-V=0.98$\pm$0.23, V-R=0.71$\pm$0.09, R-I=0.14$\pm$0.10, g-r=0.84$\pm$0.05 mag, r-i=0.16$\pm$0.03 mag, i-z=-0.02$\pm$0.07 mag, and g-i=1.00$\pm$0.05 mag and a spectral slope of 16.0$\pm$1.9 $\%$/100 nm.} We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 184.6$\pm$4.6 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. 3I/ATLAS's coma has FWHM$\simeq$2.2 arcsec and A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$=280.8$\pm$3.2 cm. \textbf{We estimate that 3I/ATLAS's \textmu m-scale to mm-scale dust is ejected at $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying a dust production of $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution, broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data reduction and flux calibration were applied. Although the object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.</description>

      <title>Imaging-spectroscopy diagnosis of the giant sloshing spiral in the Virgo cluster with the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks. Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT, the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.</description>
