      <title>On linguistic subsets of groups and monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study subsets of groups and monoids defined by language-theoretic means, generalizing the classical approach to the word problem. We expand on results by Herbst from 1991 to a more general setting, and for a class of languages $\mathbf{C}$ we define the classes of $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat and $\mathbf{C}^\exists$-flat groups. We prove several closure results for these classes of groups, prove a connection with the word problem, and characterize $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat groups for several classes of languages. In general, we prove that the class of $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat groups is a strict subclass of the class of groups with word problem in $\mathbf{C}$, including for the class $\mathrm{REC}$ of recursive languages, for which $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flatness for a group resp. monoid is proved to be equivalent to the decidability of the subgroup membership problem resp. the submonoid membership problem. We provide a number of examples, including the Tarski monsters of Ol'shanskii, showing the difficulty of characterizing $\mathbf{C}^\exists$-flat groups. As an application of our general methods, we also prove in passing that if $\mathbf{C}$ is a full semi-$\mathrm{AFL}$, then the class of epi-$\mathbf{C}$ groups is closed under taking finite index subgroups. This answers a question recently posed by Al Kohli, Bleak &amp; Elliot.</description>

      <title>Groups with 5 nontrivial conjugacy classes of non self-normalizing subgroups are solvable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $n$ nonnegative integer a family of groups, denoted by $ \mathcal{D}_n $, was introduce by Bianchi et al., as the collection of all finite groups with exactly $n$ conjugacy classes of nontrivial, non self-normalizing subgroups. It was conjectured that $\mathcal{D}_5$ consists of solvable groups with derived length at most $3$. In this note we verify their conjecture.</description>

      <title>A note on finiteness properties of vertex stabilisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a criterion for the geometric and algebraic finiteness properties of vertex stabilisers of $G$-CW-complexes, given the finiteness properties of the group $G$ and of the stabilisers of positive dimensional cells. This generalises a result of Haglund--Wise for groups acting on trees to higher dimensions. As an application, for $n\ge 2$, we deduce the existence of uncountably many quasi-isometry classes of one-ended groups that are of type $\mathsf{FP}_n$ and not of type $\mathsf{FP}_{n+1}$.</description>

      <title>New classes of IYB groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proven that every finite group of odd order with all Sylow subgroups of nilpotency class at most two is an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB group for short), i.e. it admits a structure of left brace. It is also proven that every finite solvable group of even order with all Sylow subgroups of nilpotency class at most two and abelian Sylow 2-subgroups is an IYB group. These results contribute to the open problem asking which finite solvable groups are IYB, in particular they generalize a result of Ben David and Ginosar concerned with finite solvable groups with abelian Sylow subgroups.</description>

      <title>The R$_{\infty}$-property for braid groups over orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,p}$ be an orientable surface of genus $g$ and of finite type without boundary (i.e. an orientable closed surface with a finite number $p$ of points removed). In this paper we study the R$_{\infty}$-property for the surface pure braid groups $P_n(\Sigma_{g,p})$ as well as for the full surface braid groups $B_n(\Sigma_{g,p})$. We show that, with few exceptions, these groups have the R$_{\infty}$-property.</description>

      <title>Division rings for group algebras of virtually compact special groups and $3$-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08165v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a division ring and let $G$ be either a torsion-free virtually compact special group or a finitely generated torsion-free $3$-manifold group. We embed the group algebra $kG$ in a division ring and prove that the embedding is Hughes-free whenever $G$ is locally indicable. In particular, we prove that Kaplansky's Zero Divisor Conjecture holds for all group algebras of torsion-free $3$-manifold groups. The embedding is also used to confirm a conjecture of Kielak and Linton. Thanks to the work of Jaikin-Zapirain and Linton, another consequence of the embedding is that $kG$ is coherent whenever $G$ is a virtually compact special one-relator group.
  If $G$ is a torsion-free one-relator group, let $\overline{kG}$ be the division ring containing $kG$ constructed by Lewin and Lewin. We prove that $\overline{kG}$ is Hughes-free whenever a Hughes-free $kG$-division ring exists. This is always the case when $k$ is of characteristic zero; in positive characteristic, our previous result implies that this happens when $G$ is virtually compact special.</description>

      <title>Liouville property for groups and conformal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal dimension is a fundamental invariant of metric spaces, particularly suited to the study of self-similar spaces, such as spaces with an expanding self-covering (e.g. Julia sets of complex rational functions). The dynamics of these systems are encoded by the associated iterated monodromy groups, which are examples of contracting self-similar groups. Their amenability is a well-known open question. We show that if $G$ is an iterated monodromy group, and if the (Alfhors-regular) conformal dimension of the underlying space is strictly less than 2, then every symmetric random walk with finite second moment on $G$ has the Liouville property. As a corollary, every such group is amenable. This criterion applies to all examples of contracting groups previously known to be amenable, and to many new ones. In particular, it implies that for every sub-hyperbolic complex rational function $f$ whose Julia set is not the whole sphere, the iterated monodromy group of $f$ is amenable.</description>

      <title>Letter-braiding: bridging combinatorial group theory and topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define invariants of words in arbitrary groups, measuring how letters in a word are interleaving, perfectly detecting the dimension series of a group. These are the letter-braiding invariants. On free groups, braiding invariants coincide with coefficients in the Magnus expansion. In contrast with Magnus' coefficients, our invariants are defined on all groups and over any PID. They respect products in the group and are a complete invariant of the dimension series, so they are the coefficients of a universal multiplicative finite-type invariant, depending functorially on the group.
  Letter-braiding invariants arise from the bar construction on a cochain model of a space with a prescribed fundamental group. This approach specializes to simplicial presentations of a group as well as to more geometric contexts, which we illustrate in examples. As an application, we define variants of the Johnson filtration and the Johnson homomorphism on the automorphisms of arbitrary groups, and use them to constrain automorphisms of finite p-groups.</description>

      <title>The Hanna Neumann Conjecture for graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hanna Neumann Conjecture (HNC) for a free group $G$ predicts that $\overline{\chi}(U\cap V)\leq \overline{\chi} (U)\overline{\chi}(V)$ for all finitely generated subgroups $U$ and $V$, where $\overline{\chi}(H) = \max\{-\chi(H),0\}$ denotes the reduced Euler characteristic of $H$. A strengthened version of the HNC was proved independently by Friedman and Mineyev in 2011. Recently, Antol\'in and Jaikin-Zapirain introduced the $L^2$-Hall property and showed that if $G$ is a hyperbolic limit group that satisfies this property, then $G$ satisfies the HNC. Antol\'in and Jaikin-Zapirain established the $L^2$-Hall property for free and surface groups, which Brown and Kharlampovich extended to all limit groups. In this article, we prove the $L^2$-Hall property for graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups that are hyperbolic relative to virtually abelian subgroups. We also give another proof of the $L^2$-Hall property for limit groups. As a corollary, we show that all these groups satisfy a strengthened version of the HNC.</description>

      <title>Top-degree rational cohomology in the symplectic group of a number ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $R = \mathcal{O}_K$. We show that if $R$ is not a principal ideal domain, then the symplectic group $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(R)$ has non-trivial rational cohomology in its virtual cohomological dimension. This demonstrates a sharp contrast to the situation where $R$ is Euclidean. To prove our result, we study the symplectic Steinberg module, i.e. the top-dimensional homology group of the spherical building associated to $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(K)$. We show that this module is not generated by integral apartment classes.</description>
