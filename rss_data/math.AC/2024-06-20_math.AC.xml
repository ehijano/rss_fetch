      <title>Wilf's question in numerical semigroups $S_3$ revisited and inequalities for higher genera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider numerical semigroups $S_3 = \langle d_1,d_2,d_3
\rangle$, minimally generated by three positive integers. We revisit the Wilf question in $S_3$ and, making use of identities for degrees of syzygies of such semigroups, give a short proof of existence of an affirmative answer. We find also the lower bound for Frobenius numbers of $S_3$ and upper and lower bounds for higher genera.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hamming weights and symbolic powers of Stanley-Reisner ideals of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the first generalized Hamming weight of a code, more commonly called \textit{the minimum distance} of the code, corresponds to the initial degree of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the matroid of the dual code. Our starting point in this paper is a generalization of this fact -- namely, the $r$-th generalized Hamming weight of a code is the smallest degree of a squarefree monomial in the $r$-th symbolic power of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the matroid of the dual code (in the appropriate range for $r$). It turns out that the squarefree monomials in successive symbolic powers of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a matroid suffice to describe all symbolic powers of the Stanley-Reisner ideal. This implies that generalized Hamming weights -- which can be defined in a natural way for matroids -- are fundamentally tied to the structure of symbolic powers of Stanley-Reisner ideals of matroids. We illustrate this by studying initial degree statistics of symbolic powers of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a matroid in terms of generalized Hamming weights and working out many examples that are meaningful from a coding-theoretic perspective. Our results also apply to projective varieties known as matroid configurations introduced by Geramita-Harbourne-Migliore-Nagel.</description>

      <title>On squarefree powers of simplicial trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the squarefree powers of facet ideals associated with simplicial trees. Specifically, we examine the linearity of their minimal free resolution and their regularity. Additionally, we investigate when the first syzygy module of squarefree powers of a simplicial tree is linearly related. Finally, we provide a combinatorial formula for the regularity of the squarefree powers of $t$-path ideals of path graphs.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Symbolic Powers of Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the structure of the symbolic powers $I^{(\ell)}$ of the Stanley-Reisner ideals, and cover ideals, $I$, of matroids. We (a) prove a structure theorem describing a minimal generating set for every $I^{(\ell)}$; (b) describe the (non--standard graded) symbolic Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}_s(I)$ of $I$ and show its minimal algebra generators have degree at most ht $I$; (c) provide an explicit, simple formula to compute the largest degree of a minimal algebra generator of $\mathcal{R}_s(I)$; (d) provide algebraic applications, including formulas for the symbolic defects of $I$, the initial degree of $I^{(\ell)}$, and the Waldschmidt constant of $I$; (e) provide a new algorithm allowing fast computations of very large symbolic powers of $I$.
  One of the by-products is a new characterization of matroids in terms of minimal generators of $I^{(\ell)}$ for some $\ell\geq 2$. In particular, it yields a new, simple characterization of matroids in terms of the minimal generators of $I^{(2)}$. This is the first characterization of matroids in terms of $I^{(2)}$, and it complements a celebrated theorem by Minh-Trung, Varbaro, and Terai-Trung which requires the investigation of homological properties of $I^{(\ell)}$ for some $\ell\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Attached Primes of Local Cohomology Modules of Binomial Edge Ideals of Block Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the minimal attached primes of the local cohomology modules of the binomial edge ideals of block graphs. In particular, we obtain a combinatorial characterisation of which of these modules are non-vanishing.
  We further conjecture that every attached prime of these modules is minimal, and, more strongly, that the binomial edge ideals of block graphs are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Invariant rings of the special orthogonal group have nonunimodal $h$-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $K$ an infinite field of characteristic other than two, consider the action of the special orthogonal group $\operatorname{SO}_t(K)$ on a polynomial ring via copies of the regular representation. When $K$ has characteristic zero, Boutot's theorem implies that the invariant ring has rational singularities; when $K$ has positive characteristic, the invariant ring is $F$-regular, as proven by Hashimoto using good filtrations. We give a new proof of this, viewing the invariant ring for $\operatorname{SO}_t(K)$ as a cyclic cover of the invariant ring for the corresponding orthogonal group; this point of view has a number of useful consequences, for example it readily yields the $a$-invariant and information on the Hilbert series. Indeed, we use this to show that the $h$-vector of the invariant ring for $\operatorname{SO}_t(K)$ need not be unimodal.</description>

      <title>Frobenius-Poincar\'e function and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of a graded triple $(M,R,I)$ in characteristic $p&gt;0$ by proving that for any complex number $y$, the limit
  $$\underset{n \to \infty}{\lim}(\frac{1}{p^n})^{\text{dim}(M)}\sum \limits_{j= -\infty}^{\infty}\lambda \left( (\frac{M}{I^{[p^n]}M})_j\right)e^{-iyj/p^n}$$ exists. We prove that the limiting function in the complex variable $y$ is entire and name this function the \textit{Frobenius-Poincar\'e function}. We establish various properties of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions including its relation with the tight closure of the defining ideal $I$; and relate the study Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions to the behaviour of graded Betti numbers of $\frac{R}{I^{[p^n]}} $ as $n$ varies. Our description of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions in dimension one and two and other examples raises questions on the structure of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions in general.</description>

      <title>Resolutions as directed colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the structures of a monoid of triangular vector-permutation polynomials, its group of units and its induced group of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n&gt;1$ and let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity $1\ne 0$ and $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]^n$ the set of all $n$-tuples of polynomials of the form $(f_1,\ldots,f_n),$ where $f_1,\ldots,f_n\in R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. We call these $n$-tuples vector-polynomials. We define composition on $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]^n$ by $$\vec{g}\circ \vec{f}=(g_1(f_1, \ldots ,f_n), \ldots ,g_n (f_1, \ldots ,f_n)), \text{ where }\vec{f}=(f_1, \ldots ,f_n), \vec{g}=(g_1, \ldots ,g_n).$$
  In this paper, we investigate vector-polynomials of the form $$ \vec{f}=(f_0,f_1 +x_2g_1,\ldots, f_{n-1} +x_n g_{n-1}),$$ where $f_0\in R[x_1]$ permutes the elements of $R$ and $f_i ,g_i\in R[x_1,\ldots,x_i]$ such that each $g_i$ maps $R^i$ into the units of $R$ ($i=1,\ldots, n-1$). We show that each such vector-polynomial permutes the elements of $R^n$ and that the set of all such vector-polynomials $\mathcal{MT}_n$ is a monoid with respect to composition. We also show that $ \vec{f} $ is invertible in $\mathcal{MT}_n$ if and only if $f_0$ is an $R$-automorphism of $R[x_1]$ and $g_i$ is invertible in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_i]$ for $i=1,\ldots, n-1$.
  When $R$ is finite, the monoid $\mathcal{MT}_n$ induces a finite group of permutations of $R^n$. Moreover, we decompose the monoid $\mathcal{MT}_n$ into an iterated semi-direct product of $n$ monoids. Such a decomposition allows us to obtain similar decompositions of its group of units and, when $R$ is finite, of its induced group of permutations. Furthermore, the decomposition of the induced group helps us to characterize some of its properties.</description>

      <title>Higher multiplier ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16763v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate a family of ideal sheaves to any Q-effective divisor on a complex manifold, called the higher multiplier ideals, using the theory of mixed Hodge modules and V-filtrations. This family is indexed by two parameters, an integer indicating the Hodge level and a rational number, and these ideals admit a weight filtration. When the Hodge level is zero, they recover the usual multiplier ideals. We study the local and global properties of higher multiplier ideals systematically. In particular, we prove vanishing theorems and restriction theorems, and provide criteria for the nontriviality of the new ideals. The main idea is to exploit the global structure of the V-filtration along an effective divisor using the notion of twisted Hodge modules. In the local theory, we introduce the notion of the center of minimal exponent, which generalizes the notion of minimal log canonical center. As applications, we prove some cases of conjectures by Debarre, Casalaina-Martin and Grushevsky on singularities of theta divisors on principally polarized abelian varieties and the geometric Riemann-Schottky problem.</description>

      <title>Hulls of projective Reed-Muller codes over the projective plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By solving a problem regarding polynomials in a quotient ring, we obtain the relative hull and the Hermitian hull of projective Reed-Muller codes over the projective plane. The dimension of the hull determines the minimum number of maximally entangled pairs required for the corresponding entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code. Hence, by computing the dimension of the hull we now have all the parameters of the symmetric and asymmetric entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes constructed with projective Reed-Muller codes over the projective plane. As a byproduct, we also compute the dimension of the Hermitian hull for affine Reed-Muller codes in 2 variables.</description>
