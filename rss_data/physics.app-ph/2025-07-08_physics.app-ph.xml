      <title>Unraveling Quantum Size-Dependent Optoelectrical Phenomena in Hot Carrier Quantum Well Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement of power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of single-junction solar cells is a key objective in the advancement of hot carrier solar cells. Recent findings indicate that quantum wells (QWs) can effectively generate hot carriers by confining charged carriers within their potential wells and by optimizing material properties. Here, we investigate the impact of quantum confinement on the thermodynamic properties of photogenerated hot carriers in p-i-n InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructure diodes, utilizing QW thicknesses of 4 nm, 5.5 nm, and 7.5 nm. The optical properties of these nanostructures reveal significant hot carrier effects at various lattice temperatures, with a pronounced effect noted at lower temperatures. The experimental results indicate that the widest QW exhibits stronger hot carrier effects than the thinner QWs. Additionally, the open-circuit voltage of the samples demonstrates a correlation with the degree of quantum confinement, mirroring trends observed in the quasi-Fermi level splitting of hot carriers. However, the magnitudes recorded exceed the bandgap of the quantum structures, suggesting that this behavior may be influenced by the barrier layer. Furthermore, the short-circuit current of the samples reveals a strong dependence on excitation power, but not on the degree of quantum confinement. This indicates that the majority of the photocurrent is generated in the barrier, with negligible contributions from photogenerated carriers within the QWs. This study provides insights into the role of quantum confinement on the opto-electrical properties of non-equilibrium hot carrier populations in QW structures.</description>

      <title>Novel 1-bit Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel 1-bit hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) designed to sense the incident signal's angle of arrival (AoA) and redirect it toward desired directions. This device consists of independently tunable resonant patch elements loaded with PIN diodes. To introduce sensing capabilities, a portion of the signal incident on each element is coupled to a parallel plate waveguide (PPWG) through small rectangular slots. Two coaxial connectors are then used to collect the signal coupled to the PPWG. We use compressive sensing techniques and a multi-layer perceptron to analyze this signal and detect AoA. Further, pre-coded phase randomization is implemented by varying slot sizes to suppress undesired quantization lobes. The proposed HRIS is simple, low-cost, and can pave the way for intelligent wireless communication, power transfer, and sensing without needing feedback loops.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux threading a planar holed superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically evaluate the currents in a planar-holed ideal (perfect magnetic shielding) superconductor when an axial dipole is located along the system's axis, obtaining a simple relation between the fluxoid (in this geometry, it equals the flux) threading the hole, the net current circling it, and the magnitude and position of the dipole. This expression has to be added to the basic screening equations describing the superconductor to understand the different physical situations that can appear. Thus several scenarios are studied: field and zero-field cooling cases, where the flux threading the hole is fixed; superconductors with a slit where the net current circling the hole is zero; and self-inductance case, where the flux threading the hole is only due to the screening currents. All the presented results are analytical for the axial dipole and are given as a function of the distance of the dipole from the plane of the superconductor. The obtained results can serve as a benchmark for recent and ongoing micromechanical experiments aimed at developing ultrasensitive gravimeters or applications searching for exotic spin-dependent interactions and dark matter, for example.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Metallic NbS2 one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the experimental realization of metallic NbS2-based one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures applying a modified NaCl-assisted chemical vapor deposition approach. By employing a "remote salt" strategy, precise control over NaCl supply was achieved, enabling the growth of high-quality coaxial NbS2 nanotubes on single-walled carbon nanotube-boron nitride nanotube (SWCNT-BNNT) templates. With the remote salt strategy, the morphologies of as synthesized NbS2 could be controlled from 1D nanotubes to suspended 2D flakes. Structural characterization via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirms the formation of crystalline NbS2 nanotubes, revealing a distinct bi-layer preference compared to monolayer-dominated semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide analogs. Optical analyses using UV-vis-NIR and FTIR spectroscopy highlight the metallic nature of NbS2. With Raman analysis, oxidation studies demonstrate relative higher degradation rate of 1D NbS2 under ambient conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the stabilization mechanism of bi-layer NbS2 nanotubes, emphasizing interlayer charge transfer and Coulomb interactions. This work establishes a robust framework for synthesizing metallic 1D vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications in optoelectronics and nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Optimising germanium hole spin qubits with a room-temperature magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative. Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds, and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance. Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Implantation studies of low-energy positive muons in niobium thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we study the range of keV positive muons $\mu^+$ implanted in Nb$_2$O$_5$($x$ nm)/Nb($y$ nm)/SiO$_2$(300 nm)/Si [$x$ = 3.6 nm, 3.3 nm; $y$ = 42.0 nm, 60.1 nm] thin films using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR). At implantation energies 1.3 keV $\leq E \leq$ 23.3 keV, we compare the measured diamagnetic $\mu^+$ signal fraction $f_{\mathrm{dia.}}$ against predictions derived from implantation profile simulations using the TRIM.SP Monte Carlo code. Treating the implanted $\mu^+$ as light protons, we find that simulations making use of updated stopping cross section data are in good agreement with the LE-$\mu$SR measurements, in contrast to parameterizations found in earlier tabulations. Implications for other studies relying on accurate $\mu^+$ stopping information are discussed.</description>

      <title>On-Device Control of Electronic Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction causes mechanical energy dissipation and material degradation in machinery and devices. While phononic friction is well understood via anharmonic lattice dynamics, the physics of electronic friction remains unclear due to challenges in separating electronic degrees of freedom from phononic ones in experiments and analyzing the non-equilibrium interactions between ionic movement and electronic dynamics in theory. To tackle this problem, we construct a sliding device featuring 2D crystalline interfaces that possess ultra-smooth and minimally interacting surfaces, achieving the state of structural superlubricity with no wear and minimal friction. Using electrical and mechanical controls, we tuned the nature of interfacial electronic coupling and charge densities in materials in an on-device setting, which allows us to disentangle the electron and phonon contributions to friction. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis supported by first-principles calculations demonstrate that electronic friction can well surpass phononic contributions and dominate energy dissipation at structural superlubricity contacts. These findings offer fresh insights into the mechanism of electronic friction and promising opportunities for friction control in device applications.</description>

      <title>Disorder-enabled Synthetic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces have catalyzed transformative advances across imaging, optoelectronics, quantum information processing, sensing, energy conversion, and optical computing. Yet, despite this rapid progress, most research remains focused on optimizing single functionalities, constrained by the persistent challenge of integrating multiple functions within a single device. Here, we demonstrate that engineered structural disorder of metapixels, used to implement a photonic function, can significantly reduce the area required across the entire aperture without compromising optical performance. The unallocated space can then be repurposed to encode functionally distinct metapixels without increasing the design complexity, each independently addressable via various optical degrees of freedom. As a proof of concept, we present a synthetic achromatic metalens featuring 11 spectrally distinct lens profiles encoded through nonlocal metapixels engineered to support sharp resonances via quasi bound states in the continuum. This large-scale metalens with 8.1 mm aperture achieves diffraction-limited achromatic focusing across the 1200 to 1400 nm spectral window. We further incorporate polarization-selective metapixels to implement momentum-space distinct gratings, enabling single-shot, high spatial resolution polarimetric imaging of arbitrarily structured light fields, including radial and azimuthal vector beams and optical skyrmions. Altogether, this disorder-enabled synthetic metasurface platform establishes a versatile foundation for unifying diverse photonic functionalities within a single optical element, marking a substantial step toward compact, high-density, multifunctional optical devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the mechanisms of crystal nucleation in metal melts, in dependence on the influence of their shape and volume. Investigations were conducted on both thin flat and bulk samples prepared of low-temperature Wood's metal alloy and transparent organic media (camphene and diphenylamine). The study revealed that in flat samples, the nucleation rate is primarily influenced by the activity of the mold wall surface, which is affected by melt overheating and subcooling, while in bulk samples, supercooling and nucleation are additionally influenced by factors such as impurity activity, temperature, and density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</description>

      <title>Unlocking high coercivity at room temperature in phase modified MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials showing room-temperature magnetism and high coercivity are desired for combining magnetism with semiconducting properties useful for spintronics. In this work, the magnetic properties of the 1T phase of MoS$_2$ have been studied at room temperature. We observe ferromagnetism with a coercivity of ~0.3 T and a maximum saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu/g at room temperature. This is the highest among coercivities reported so far in 2D magnets at room temperature. MoS$_2$ nanosheets are prepared using a single-step hydrothermal synthesis with a relative 1T-phase reaching up to 77%. We report a correlation between the structural and magnetic characteristics via interplanar distance and coercivity. The increase in interplanar distance is also accompanied by an increase in the 1T phase. Our results pave a useful way of controlling the coercivity and saturation magnetization in a 2D magnet with applications in spintronics and low-power quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning to Automate Parameter Extraction and Model Fitting of Two-Dimensional Transistors</title>

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g., mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional (2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500 devices, a factor &gt;40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently, fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models, including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination ($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets online.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Structural Light Absorbers</title>

Abstract: The interaction of light with optical and mechanical systems is influenced by material properties, geometrical configurations, and surface topographies. Designing these systems necessitates a careful balance of conflicting requirements, such as minimising size and weight while simultaneously improving heat transfer and reducing stray light from illuminated peripheral mounting surfaces. Stray light is typically mitigated by apertures, coatings, and microscopic structures, alongside maintaining cleanliness. However, using apertures may not always be feasible, and effective optical absorber coatings or microscopic light absorbing structures can be costly and sensitive to environmental factors such as abrasion, radiation heating, or cleaning agents.
  In a proof-of-concept investigation, we design and analyse macroscopic structural light absorbers realised as periodic minimal surface approximations and quasi-stochastic lattices. The term "macroscopic" refers to minimal structural dimensions of approximately 100 micrometres. By increasing the number of reflections before residual reflected light reaches a hemispherical receiver, we achieve reductions in received peak intensities by factors of less than 0.39 and average intensities by factors of less than 0.65, without altering the surface properties.
  Macroscopic structural light absorbers support cost-effective and robust light-absorbing materials, such as black anodised aluminium or ABS polymers, while still achieving satisfactory stray light suppression. This approach is applicable to aerospace optical systems (such as telescopes and imaging spectrometers), as well as general scientific and industrial optical instruments and commercial products (including projectors and luminaires). The demonstrated structures can be sustainably fabricated through additive manufacturing processes like laser powder bed fusion.</description>

      <title>Signatures of valley drift in the diversified band dispersions of bright, gray, and dark excitons in MoS2 monolayers under uni-axial strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the strain-modulated excitonic properties of uni-axially strained transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers (TMD-MLs) by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) established on the basis of first principles. We show that imposing an uni-axial strain onto a MoS_$2$ monolayers leads to the diversified band dispersions of the bright exciton (BX), gray exciton (GX), and dark exciton (DX) states, as a consequence of the competitive interplay between strain-induced valley drift (VD) and momentum-dependent electron-hole exchange interaction (EHEI). While the band dispersions of BX doublet in the light-accessible small reciprocal area remain almost unchanged against strain, the band dispersion of DX is reshaped by an increasing uni-axial strain from a parabola to a Mexican-hat-like profile, featured with unusual sign-reversal of the heavy effective mass and strain-activated brightness. In contrast, the effective mass of GX is drastically lightened by uni-axial strain and remains always positive. We show that the strain-diversified exciton band dispersions leads to the distinct exciton diffusivities and angle-resolved optical patterns of BX, GX, and DX in a strained TMD-ML, suggesting the feasibility of {\it spatially} resolving spinallowed and -forbidden excitons in exciton transport experiments and angle-resolved optical spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Propagation of Flexural Elastic Waves With Ceramic Metatiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the application of phononic metamaterials for elastic impact noise insulation in tiled flooring, through the development of an innovative ceramic metatile that incorporates phononic crystals with optimized joint configurations. First, we optimize the geometrical and material parameters of the proposed metatile, which is composed of small ceramic subtiles connected by silicon joints, in order to reduce longitudinal and flexural wave propagation on tiled floors, which are responsible for noise vibrations in tiled environments. A bandgap is achieved that effectively suppresses the transmission of impact noise through the periodic structural configuration. For flexural waves, the ceramic metatile exhibits a pronounced attenuation of wave transmission in the range of $500$-$1900$ Hz along the $[100]$ direction, and $500$-$1400$ Hz along the $[110]$ direction. For longitudinal waves, a broad bandgap is observed, spanning from $400$ Hz to $1950$ Hz in both the $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. Additionally, the bandgaps shift toward lower frequencies with increasing width of the subtiles and silicon joints, or with a decrease in the Young's modulus of the silicon. In both experimental and numerical tests, it is demonstrated that the integration of silicon joints inside the ceramic metatile improves the acoustic insulation performance, as measured by the reduction of impact noise levels across a wide range of low frequencies. The findings highlight the potential of metamaterials in architectural acoustics, offering innovative solutions for elastic wave control in tiled environments.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum current source on commercial CMOS process technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many quantum technologies require a precise electrical current standard that can only be achieved with expensive cryogenics, or through the secondary standards, such as resistance or voltage. Silicon-based charge pumps could provide such a standard in an inherently scalable way, through their compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication methods. However, coherent quantized charge transfer has so far been demonstrated only in nanoscale devices that are custom-fabricated in academic cleanrooms or research technology foundries. Here, we show that a CMOS device manufactured with commercial 22-nm process node can be used to define a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure an accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A at 50 MHz with reference to SI voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. We then propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This chip could be operated as a table-top primary standard that can be easily integrated with CMOS electronics, generating quantum currents of up to microampere levels.</description>

      <title>Clay metaBrick-based motif to enhance thermal and acoustic insulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials have gained popularity as promising materials for enhancing noise reduction. Here, we explore the use of metamaterials, based on Helmholtz resonators (HRs), to enhance the performance of standard clay hollow brick. By incorporating HRs in the upper and lower hollows, we transform the standard brick into metaBrick, which is essentially designed based on metamaterial principles. We evaluate the acoustic and thermal performance of walls constructed with clay metaBricks, focusing on sound transmission loss and heat resistance. Both the finite element method and experimental analysis were employed to highlight the performance of metaBricks compared to standard clay bricks. Results show that metaBricks significantly enhance acoustic and thermal insulation, achieving an attenuation of $20$ \si{dB} across a broad frequency range from $500$ to $2500$ \si{Hz} and an $8$\% increase in thermal resistance. However, compressive strength is reduced by $33$\%, though it remains above the standard requirements for building materials. These findings indicate that metaBrick is a promising building material, offering improved sound and thermal insulation.</description>

      <title>Phase-change materials for volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal device applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal oscillations in phase-change materials, specifically those undergoing metal-to-insulator transitions, offer unique attributes such as fast and low-field volatile switching, tunability, and stochastic dynamics. These characteristics are particularly promising for emulating neuronal behaviors and solving complex computational problems. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of volatile resistive switching devices and neuronal oscillators based on three representative materials with coincident electronic and structural phase transitions, at different levels of technological readiness: the well-studied correlated oxide VO2, the charge-density-wave transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, and the emerging phase-change chalcogenide perovskite BaTiS3. We discuss progresses from the perspective of materials development and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Wafer scale reactive sputtering of highly oriented and ferroelectric Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N from 300 mm AlSc Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents progress towards the large-scale manufacturability of piezo- and ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films with very high Sc content. Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N layers were deposited by reactive sputtering from a 300 mm diameter Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N target on standard 200 mm Si wafers with Pt bottom- and Mo top-electrodes. The deposited films were analyzed in depth with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) showing well oriented c-axis growth over the full wafer with slight variation in the film thickness and Sc content over the wafer radius. An overall low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOG) was found. Further wafer mapping for piezoelectric and dielectric properties showed a piezoelectric performance increase by 40 % in comparison to Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N while only moderately increasing the permittivity and loss factor. Switching measurements revealed ferroelectric behavior of the film on all measured positions with an average remanent polarization of 88.36 uC/cm$^2$ and an average coercive field of 244 V/um. This successful demonstration opens new opportunities for MEMS applications with demands for high forces like microspeakers or quasi static micromirrors.</description>

      <title>Broadband Two-Dimensional Far-Field Beam Profiling of Commercial CW Terahertz Photomixers from 0.2 to 1.5 THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic far-field characterization of four commercial PIN diode terahertz photomixers over the 0.2-1.5 THz frequency range using a two-dimensional (2D) raster scanning method. The emission pattern of each transmitter, equipped with an integrated hyper-hemispherical silicon lens, was characterized using a broadband Schottky diode receiver over a 35 mm x 35 mm grid grid. The results reveal consistent frequency-dependent beam divergence and the emergence of distinct Airy diffraction patterns at intermediate frequencies, attributed to lens-induced aperture effects. In addition to qualitative mapping, we extract quantitative metrics -- including divergence slope, beam asymmetry, ellipticity, and centroid variability -- that enable objective comparison of beam profiles across devices and frequencies. This comprehensive mapping underscores the importance of full 2D beam profiling for understanding THz propagation and offers insights into lens design and photomixer packaging for optimized system performance.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic static/dynamic triboelectric pressure sensor for continuous and event-triggered control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional pressure sensors often integrate two distinct mechanisms to detect static and dynamic stimuli, hindering the development of high fidelity human-machine interfaces. Here, we present an intrinsic static/dynamic triboelectric sensor (iSD Sensor) capable of reliably perceiving both continuous static pressure and transient mechanical shocks through a DC/AC signal decoupling strategy. By pairing hydrophobic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) with elastic conductive sponge, a pressure-adaptive triboelectric interface is formed, where microscale and large-scale separations enable static and dynamic pressure sensing, respectively. Furthermore, by employing a charge excitation strategy, the device delivers enhanced voltage outputs over 25X in static and 15X in dynamic modes. Combined with a 3D gradient conductive sponge structure, the sensor achieves multi-region sensitivities of 34.7 V/kPa (static) and 48.4 V/kPa (dynamic) under low pressure (less than 1.8 kPa), and a detection limit as low as 6.13 Pa. By perceiving continuous static pressure and transient shocks applied by the human hand, the iSD Sensor enables robotic arm control via proportional grasping and dynamic, trigger-based sign language communication. This work advances high-sensitivity, self-powered pressure sensors toward intelligent, closed-loop human-machine interaction.</description>
