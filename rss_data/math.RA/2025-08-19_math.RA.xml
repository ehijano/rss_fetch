      <title>An introduction to the algebra of rings and fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an introduction to rings and fields, written for a quarter-long undergraduate course. It includes the basic properties of ideals, modules, algebras and polynomials, the constructions of ring extensions and finite fields, some number-theoretical applications (such as a proof of quadratic reciprocity and Jacobsthal's formulas for $p = x^2 + y^2$), and tastes of Gr\"obner bases and the Smith normal form. Familiarity with groups and vector spaces is assumed, though no deep results from either theory are used.
  Over 200 exercises are included (mostly without solutions).</description>

      <title>Representation of partially ordered sets over Von Neumann regular algebras. More prime, non-primitive regular rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every partially ordered sets I, having a finite cofinal subset, and every field K we build a unital, locally matricial and hence unit-regular K-algebra B(I) such that the lattice of all its ideals is order isomorphic to the lattice of all lower subsets of I. We show that the Grothendieck group of B(I), with its natural partial order, is order isomorphic to the restricted Hahn power of Z by I; this gives a contribution to solve the Realization Problem for Dimension Groups with order-unit. Finally we show that the algebra B(I) has the following features: (a) B(I) is prime if and only if I is lower directed; (b) B(I) is primitive if and only if I has a coinitial chain; (c) B(I) is semiartinian if and only if I is artinian, in which the case I is order isomorphic to the primitive spectrum of B(I).</description>

      <title>Valuations, bijections, and bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to build a theory of commutative and noncommutative {\it injective} valuations of various algebras (including algebras with zero divisors). The targets of our valuations are (well-)ordered commutative and noncommutative (partial and entire) semigroups including any sub-semigroups of the free monoid $F_n$ on $n$ generators and various quotients. When the range of a valuation of an algebra $A$ is a finitely generated (partial) semigroup, we construct a generalization of the standard monomial bases in $A$, which seems to be new in noncommutative case. Quite remarkably, for any pair of well-ordered valuations one has a canonical bijection between the valuation semigroups, which serves as an analog of the celebrated Jordan-H\"older correspondences and these bijections are ``almost" homomorphisms of the involved semigroups. A spectacular demonstration of this remarkable property of JH-bijections for quantum Schubert cells $A=U_q(w)$ results in mysterious "symplectomorphisms" of involved skew symmetric forms.</description>
