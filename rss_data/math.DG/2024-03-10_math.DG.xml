      <title>Gears and pulleys in non-Euclidean space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study, in their non-Euclidean versions, two important mechanical systems that are very common in numerous devices. More precisely, we study the laws governing the movement of pulley and gear systems in spherical and hyperbolic geometries. And curiously, we were able to see an interesting similarity between the determined laws.</description>

      <title>On discrete Routh reduction and structures on the reduced space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we work, first, with forced discrete mechanical systems on the configuration space $Q$ and construct closed $2$-forms $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ on $Q \times Q$, that are symplectic if and only if the system is regular. For a special type of discrete force, we prove that $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ are invariant by the flow of the system. We also consider the Lagrangian reduction of a discrete mechanical system by a symmetry group (using an affine discrete connection derived from the discrete momentum) and prove that, under some conditions on the action, the trajectories of the reduced system (with discrete momentum $\mu$) can be seen as trajectories of a forced discrete mechanical system, where the discrete force is of the type analyzed before. Therefore, we prove that there is a symplectic structure that is invariant by the flow of the forced reduced system; the symplectic structure can be seen as a pullback of a canonical cotangent structure plus a magnetic term. This discrete reduction process is the (discrete) Routh reduction and the behavior obtained runs parallel to the well known case for (continuous) Routh reduction.</description>

      <title>All paths admit trajectoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper published in Nature, Y.I. Sobolev et al. introduced the concept of trajectoids: convex, rigid objects, which roll without slip or spin on a flat plane along a prescribed periodic, unbounded planar path. A geometric construction method applicable to many paths was introduced, and the theory was experimentally verified using objects rolling downwards on slightly inclined planes. The construction method was applicable to many but not all curves. A possible extension of the method (referred to as period-n trajectoids) was also proposed, but the limits of applicability were not clarified. Here, a geometric proof is given for the existence of period-n trajectoids for any sufficiently smooth prescribed curve. A somewhat different proof was recently proposed by O. Muller independently from this work. We also highlight some related geometry problems.</description>

      <title>Geometric inverse problems on gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On gas giant planets the speed of sound is isotropic and goes to zero at the surface. Geometrically, this corresponds to a Riemannian manifold whose metric tensor has a conformal blow-up near the boundary. The blow-up is tamer than in asymptotically hyperbolic geometry: the boundary is at a finite distance.
  We study the differential geometry of such manifolds, especially the asymptotic behavior of geodesics near the boundary. We relate the geometry to the propagation of singularities of a hydrodynamic PDE and we give the basic properties of the Laplace--Beltrami operator. We solve two inverse problems, showing that the interior structure of a gas giant is uniquely determined by different types of boundary data.</description>

      <title>A universal phase-field mixture representation of thermodynamics and shock wave mechanics in porous soft biologic continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuum mixture theory is formulated for large deformations, thermal effects, phase interactions, and degradation of soft biologic tissues. Such tissues consist of one or more solid and fluid phases and can demonstrate nonlinear anisotropic elastic, viscoelastic, thermoelastic, and poroelastic physics. Under extremely large or rapid deformations, for example impact or shock loading, tissues may fracture, tear, or rupture. Mechanisms are encompassed in a universal, thermodynamically consistent formulation that combines the continuum theory of mixtures with phase-field mechanics of fracture. A metric tensor of generalized Finsler space supplies geometric insight on effects rearrangements of microstructure, for example degrading collagen fibers. Governing equations are derived, and energy potentials and kinetic laws posited, for generic soft porous tissues with solid and liquid or gas phases. Shock waves are modeled as singular surfaces; Hugoniot states and shock decay are studied analytically. Suitability of the framework for representing blood, skeletal muscle, and liver is demonstrated. Insight into physics presently unresolved by experiments is obtained.</description>

      <title>Fibrations on the 6-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Z$ be a compact, connected $3$-dimensional complex manifold with vanishing first and second Betti numbers and non-vanishing Euler characteristic. We prove that there is no holomorphic mapping from $Z$ onto any $2$-dimensional complex space. Combining this with a result of Campana-Demailly-Peternell, a corollary is that any holomorphic mapping from the $6$-dimensional sphere $S^6$, endowed with any hypothetical complex structure, to a strictly lower-dimensional complex space must be constant. In other words, there does not exist any holomorphic fibration on $S^6$.</description>

      <title>HKT manifolds: Hodge theory, formality and balanced metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,I,J,K,\Omega)$ be a compact HKT manifold and denote with $\partial$ the conjugate Dolbeault operator with respect to $I$, $\partial_J:=J^{-1}\overline\partial J$, $\partial^\Lambda:=[\partial,\Lambda]$ where $\Lambda$ is the adjoint of $L:=\Omega\wedge-$. Under suitable assumptions, we study Hodge theory for the complexes $(A^{\bullet,0},\partial,\partial_J)$ and $(A^{\bullet,0},\partial,\partial^\Lambda)$ showing a similar behavior to K\"ahler manifolds. In particular, several relations among the Laplacians, the spaces of harmonic forms and the associated cohomology groups, together with Hard Lefschetz properties, are proved. Moreover, we show that for a compact HKT $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{H})$-manifold the differential graded algebra $(A^{\bullet,0},\partial)$ is formal and this will lead to an obstruction for the existence of an HKT $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{H})$-structure $(I,J,K,\Omega)$ on a compact complex manifold $(M,I)$. Finally, balanced HKT structures on solvmanifolds are studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, generalizing the techniques of Bour's theorem, we prove that every generic cuspidal edge, more generally, generic $n$-type edge, which is invariant under a helicoidal motion in Euclidean $3$-space admits non-trivial isometric deformations. As a corollary, several geometric invariants, such as the limiting normal curvature, the cusp-directional torsion, the higher order cuspidal curvature and the bias, are proved to be extrinsic invariants.</description>

      <title>The ultimate upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit conjugate points on the Stiefel manifold endowed with any member of the family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\"uper et al. (2021). This family contains the well-known canonical and Euclidean metrics. An upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold in the considered metric is then obtained as the minimum between the length of the geodesic along which the points are conjugate and the length of certain geodesic loops. Numerical experiments support the conjecture that the obtained upper bound is in fact equal to the injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Regularity of minimizing $p$-harmonic maps into spheres and sharp Kato inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study regularity of minimizing $p$-harmonic maps $u \colon B^3 \to \mathbb{S}^3$ for $p$ in the interval $[2,3]$. For a long time, regularity was known only for $p = 3$ (essentially due to Morrey) and $p = 2$ (Schoen-Uhlenbeck), but recently Gastel extended the latter result to $p \in [2,2+\frac{2}{15}]$ using a version of Kato inequality. Here, we establish regularity for a small interval $p\in [2.961,3]$ by combining Morrey's methods with Hardt and Lin's Extension Theorem. We also improve on the other result by obtaining regularity for $p \in [2,p_0]$ with $p_0 = \frac{3+\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 2.366$. In relation to this, we address a question posed by Gastel and prove a sharp Kato inequality for $p$-harmonic maps in two-dimensional domains, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Convex Hull of the Image of a Set with Smooth Boundary: Error Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the convex hull of the image $f(X)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of a compact set $X\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ with smooth boundary through a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming that $f$ is a submersion, we derive a new bound on the Hausdorff distance between the convex hull of $f(X)$ and the convex hull of the images $f(x_i)$ of $M$ sampled inputs $x_i$ on the boundary of $X$. When applied to the problem of geometric inference from a random sample, our results give error bounds that are tighter and more general than in previous work. We present applications to the problems of robust optimization, of reachability analysis of dynamical systems, and of robust trajectory optimization under bounded uncertainty.</description>
