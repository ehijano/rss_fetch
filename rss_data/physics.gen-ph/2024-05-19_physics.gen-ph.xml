      <title>Newtonian Gravitational Waves from a Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are being shown to derive directly from Newtonian dynamics for a continuous mass distribution, e g compressible fluids or equivalent. It is shown that the equations governing a continuous mass distribution, i e the inviscid Navier Stokes equations for a general variable gravitational field g(t,x), are equivalent to a form identical to Maxwell equations from electromagnetism, subject to a specified condition. The consequence of this equivalence is the creation of gravity waves that propagate at finite speed. The latter implies that Newtonian gravitation as presented in this paper is not spooky action at a distance but rather is similar to electromagnetic waves propagating at finite speed, despite the apparent form appearing in the integrated field formula. In addition, this proves that in analogy to Maxwell equations the Newtonian gravitation equations are Lorentz invariant for waves propagating at the speed of light.</description>

      <title>A heuristic sketch how it could fit all together with time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a scientific meta-level, it is discussed how an overall understanding of the physical universe can be built on the basis of well-proven theories and recent experiments and observations. In the light of almost a century of struggle to make (common) sense of Quantum Mechanics and to reconcile it with General Relativity, it is proposed to (for some time) forget about quantizing gravity or striving for one Theory of Everything or 'Weltformel', which would describe the whole of reality seamlessly without any joints or suture marks. Instead of one single monolithic formalism, a three-legged compound approach is argued for. Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and Thermodynamics are proposed as the main pillars of reality, each with its well-defined realm, specific features, and clearly marked interfaces between the three of them. Not only classical reality, which is rather directly accessible to us, is then comprehensively modelled by their encompassing combination. Quantum phenomena are understood as undoubtedly lying at the bottom of classical physics and at the same time, they become 'fully real' only when embedded in classical frames between preparation and measurement in time. It is then where thermodynamics steps in and provides the mediating glue as it does at interfaces towards gravity. The aim of this short contribution is not to deliver novel quantitative results but rather to propose a comprehensive research program and to coarsely lay out a very roughly coherent self-referential sketch starting from the beginning of the one universe, which we inhabit.</description>

      <title>Conformal theory of central surface density for galactic dark halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous dark matter studies of galactic halo gravitation depend on models with core radius $r_0$ and central density $\rho_0$. Central surface density product $\rho_0 r_0$ is found to be nearly a universal constant for a large range of galaxies. Standard variational field theory with Weyl conformal symmetry postulated for gravitation and the Higgs scalar field, without dark matter, implies nonclassical centripetal acceleration $\Delta a$, for $a=a_N+\Delta a$, where Newtonian acceleration $a_N$ is due to observable baryonic matter. Neglecting a halo cutoff at very large galactic radius, conformal $\Delta a$ is constant over the entire halo and $a=a_N+\Delta a$ is a universal function, consistent with a recent study of galaxies that constrains acceleration due to dark matter or to alternative theory. An equivalent dark matter source is a pure cusp distribution with cutoff parameter determined by a halo boundary radius. This is shown here to imply universal central surface density for any dark matter core model.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Number Systems for Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac talked about q-numbers versus c-numbers. Quantum observables are q-number variables that generally do not commute among themselves. He was proposing to have a generalized form of numbers as elements of a noncommutative algebra. That was Dirac's appreciation of the mathematical properties of the physical quantities as presented in Heisenberg's new quantum theory. After all, the familiar real, or complex, number system only came into existence through the history of mathematics. Values of physical quantities having a commutative product is an assumption that is not compatible with quantum physics. The revolutionary idea of Heisenberg and Dirac was pulled back to a much more conservative setting by the work of Schr\"odinger, followed by Born and Bohr. What Bohr missed is that the real number values we obtained from our measurements are only a consequence of the design of the kind of experiments and our using real numbers to calibrate the output scales of our apparatus. It is only our modeling of the information obtained about the physical quantities rather than what Nature dictates. We have proposed an explicit notion of definite noncommutative values of observables that gives a picture of quantum mechanics as realistic as the classical theory. In this article, we illustrate how matrices can be taken as noncommutative (q-)numbers serving as the values of physical quantities, each to be seen as a piece of quantum information. Our main task is to clarify the subtle issues involved in setting up a conventional scheme assigning matrices as values to the physical quantities.</description>
