      <title>Bound states of $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He with $\phi$+$\alpha$+$\alpha$ and $\phi$+$\phi$+$\alpha$ cluster models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He hypernuclei within the framework of the three-body cluster model %specifically as the $\phi$+$\alpha$+$\alpha$ and $\phi$+$\phi$+$\alpha$ systems, using the Faddeev formalism in configuration space. The $\phi$-$\alpha$ potential is determined through a folding procedure of the HAL QCD $\phi$-$N$ interaction in the $^4S_{3/2}$ channel with the matter distribution of $^4$He. The phenomenological $\alpha$-$\alpha$ and $\phi$-$\phi$ potentials are taken from the literature. Additionally, we construct a Wood-Saxon (WS) type interaction to simulate the $\phi$-$\alpha$ potential, also taken from the literature, based on an effective Lagrangian approach that includes $K\bar{K}$ meson loops in the $\phi$-meson self-energy. A comparison of binding energies obtained for both types of the $\phi$-$\alpha$ interactions reveals qualitative agreement. %between the obtained approaches. We predict the binding energy for the $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He hypernuclei as the mirror $\phi$+$\alpha$+$\alpha$ and $\phi$+$\phi$+$\alpha$ systems in the range of 1-11 MeV and 3-10 MeV, respectively. The range of values of the binding energies relies on the choice of the WS $\phi$-$\alpha$ interaction parameters.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of fission fragment moments of inertia for spontaneous fission of Cf-252</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current work discusses methods for estimating the moments of inertia of fission fragments for spontaneous fission of the isotope Cf-252, in particular, two main approaches are mentioned: statistical and microscopic. In addition, the methods of the classical and superfluid approaches to the calculation of the moments of inertia are discussed, as well as their application to different models of nuclei. Within this framework, the influence of different oscillation modes and nucleon exchange on the moments of inertia and spin distributions of fission fragments is evaluated. The authors emphasizes the need for a comparative analysis of theoretical predictions with experimental data for a deeper understanding of the internal structure of nuclei and fission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Bubble $^{36}$Ar and Its New Breathing Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bubble nuclei are important components of exotic nuclear structures characterized by special depletions of central densities. Focusing on bubble structures of $^{36}$Ar, the characterizations of bubble nuclei were explored with the framework of the extended quantum molecular dynamics model. Three density distribution modes were uncovered for the first time, i.e. micro-bubble, bubble, and cluster resonances, which show unique spectral signature compared to the monopole resonance spectrum as the excitation intensity was increased in bubbles. Of pivotal importance is the revelation that the bubble mode's oscillation frequency closely resembles macroscopic bubble dynamics, building a connection between classical macroscopic phenomena and the quantum complexity of the nuclear structure. The discovery marks a crucial step forward in deciphering the relationship between classical and quantum domains within the enigmatic world of atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that, in any relativistic kinetic theory whose non-hydrodynamic sector has a finite gap, the Taylor series of all hydrodynamic dispersion relations has a finite radius of convergence. Furthermore, we prove that, for shear waves, such radius of convergence cannot be smaller than $1/2$ times the gap size. Finally, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapped whenever the total scattering cross-section (expressed as a function of the energy) is bounded below by a positive non-zero constant. These results, combined with well-established covariant stability criteria, allow us to derive a rigorous upper bound on the shear viscosity of relativistic dilute gases.</description>

      <title>An MLE-based analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to explore factorization and event-plane correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our analyses incorporate both numerical simulations and publicly available data from the CMS Collaboration. We focus on Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The differential flows obtained for various centrality windows and momentum cuts are consistent with conventional methodologies such as multi-particle cumulants and event-plane methods. Leveraging these findings, we proceed to undertake further analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations. These quantities are relevant because of their sensitivity to initial-state fluctuations. While higher-order correlators might provide different implementations of factorization ratio, the MLE estimator is readily applied to these scenarios. Moreover, MLE's unique capabilities allow us to compute specific correlators that are typically inaccessible by other means. As an asymptotically normal and unbiased estimator, MLE provides a valuable alternative tool for flow and correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>Collisional and Radiative Energy Loss in Small Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an energy loss model which includes small system size corrections to both the radiative and elastic energy loss. Our model is used to compute the nuclear modification factor $R_{AB}$ of light and heavy flavor hadrons, averaged over realistic collision geometries for central and peripheral $A+A$ and central $p / d / {}^3\text{He} + A$ collisions at LHC and RHIC. We find that the predicted suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to elastic energy loss. Our results are keenly sensitive to the crossover between elastic energy loss calculated with Hard Thermal Loop propagators and vacuum propagators, respectively, which leads to a large theoretical uncertainty. We find that the $R_{AB}$ is largely insensitive to the form of the elastic energy loss distribution - Gaussian or Poisson - surprisingly so in small systems where the central limit theorem is inapplicable. We present an expansion of the $R_{AB}$ in terms of the moments of the energy loss probability distribution, which allows for a rigorous understanding of the dependence of the $R_{AB}$ on the underlying energy loss distribution.</description>

      <title>Neutral pion polarizabilities from four-point functions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle lattice QCD simulation of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities for a neutral pion in the four-point function method. The results are based on the same quenched Wilson ensembles on a $24^3\times 48$ lattice at $\beta=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV previously used for a charged pion. For electric polarizability, the results are largely consistent with those from the background field method and ChPT. In contrast, there are significant differences for magnetic polarizability among the four-point function method, the background field method, and ChPT. The situation points to the potentially important role of disconnected diagrams for a neutral pion. We elucidate a transparent quark decomposition in the four-point function method that can be used to shed light on the issue.</description>

      <title>The effect of vorticity on the dynamical magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14077v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions are pivotal and subject to diverse factors. In this study, we quantitatively investigate the impact of fluid vorticity on the evolution of magnetic fields in the 20-50\% centrality class in Au+Au collisions, with collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=(7.7, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 200)$ GeV. Our results indicate that fluid vorticity leads to a delay in the evolution of the magnetic field, in which this effect becomes more pronounced as the collision energy decreases. Additionally, we have calculated the mean magnetic field values on the freeze-out hypersurface for various collision energies. Our simulation results align with the values inferred from experimental data of $\bar{\Lambda}-\Lambda$, within the error margins.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and nuclear-physics implications of a subsolar gravitational-wave event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.</description>

      <title>Relativistic spin hydrodynamics with momentum and spin-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the extended relaxation time approximation (ERTA) along with the theory of semi-classical spin, we develop a framework of relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics such that the relaxation time can depend on the momenta and spin of the constituent spin-1/2 particles. We also consider a general definition of the fluid four-velocity allowing the theory to be valid in a general frame and matching conditions. Consequently, we construct the frame-invariant bulk, shear, particle diffusion, and spin transport coefficients, showing that the evolution of fluid remains unaffected by spin in the limit of small polarization as was the case where the relaxation time was independent of spin or momentum.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits that contain only gates respecting a symmetry. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on the set of realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. Generically, such constraints include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while in the case of Z_2, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries, 2-qubit gates are semi-universal on qubit systems, in the case of SU(d) symmetry with d\ge 3, semi-universality can be achieved only with 3-qudit gates. The failure of semi-universality implies that the distribution generated by the circuit is not even a 2-design for the Haar (uniform) distribution over the group of all unitaries respecting the symmetry. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions on the gate set, which hold, e.g., in the case of U(1) and SU(2), the distribution of unitaries generated by the random circuit becomes a t-design for t growing polynomially with the number of qudits with a degree that is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum value of the integer t, for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a t-design, and solve this equation for various examples.</description>

      <title>Effects of Phi and $\sigma^{*}$-meson on properties of hyperon stars including $\Delta$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of neutron stars using the linear Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory and consider multiple degrees of freedom inside neutron stars, including hyperons and $\Delta$ resonances. We investigate different coupling parameters $x_{\sigma \Delta}$ between $\Delta$ resonances and nucleons and compare the differences between neutron stars with and without strange mesons $\sigma^*$ and $\phi$. These effects include particle number distributions, equations of state (EOS), mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. To overcome the "hyperon puzzle," we employ the $\sigma-cut$ scheme to obtain neutron stars with masses up to $2M_{\odot}$. We find that strange mesons appear at around 3$\rho_0$ and reduce the critical density of baryons in the high-density region. With increasing coupling parameter $x_{\sigma \Delta}$, the $\Delta$ resonances suppress hyperons, leading to a shift of the critical density towards lower values. The early appearance of $\Delta$ resonances may play a crucial role in the stability of neutron stars. Strange mesons soften the EOS slightly, while $\Delta$ resonances predominantly soften the EOS in the low-density region. By calculating tidal deformabilities and comparing with astronomical observation GW170817, we find that the inclusion of $\Delta$ resonances decreases the radius of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Frame transformation and stable-causal hydrodynamic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing formulations of relativistic hydrodynamic theories, which, in order to be causal and stable, (i) either requires `non-fluid' variables apart from velocity and temperature to be promoted to new degrees of freedom, or, (ii) needs to be in a generalized hydrodynamic frame other than those given by Landau or Eckart. The BDNK stress tensor (originally in a general frame) has been rewritten in the Landau frame using linearized all-order gradient-corrected redefinitions of the temperature and velocity fields. The redefinitions indicate that, while the BDNK formalism has a finite number of derivatives in the general frame, when written in the Landau frame, it either has an infinite number of derivatives, or one has to introduce MIS-like `non-fluid' variables by summing the infinite number of derivatives in the field redefinitions. There can be non-unique ways of performing these infinite-order summations. Finally, the dispersion relations and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Single-channel, single-energy partial-wave analysis with continuity improved through minimal phase constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-energy partial-wave analysis has often been applied as a way to fit data with minimal model dependence. However, remaining unconstrained, partial waves at neighboring energies will vary discontinuously because the overall amplitude phase cannot be determined through single-channel measurements. This problem can be mitigated through the use of a constraining penalty function based on an associated energy-dependent fit. However, the weight given to this constraint results in a biased fit to the data. In this paper, for the first time, we explore a constraining function which does not influence the fit to data. The constraint comes from the overall phase found in multi-channel fits which, in the present study, are the Bonn-Gatchina and J\"ulich-Bonn multi-channel analyses. The data are well reproduced and weighting of the penalty function does not influence the result. The method is applied to $K \Lambda$ photoproduction data and all observables can be maximally well reproduced. While the employed multi-channel analyses display very different multipole amplitudes, we show that the major difference between two sets of multipoles can be related to the different overall phases.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory suggests, on geometric grounds and with a physically-reasoned assumption that the excluded-volume size of neutrons is 20\% larger than that of protons, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$. This new ``geometric'' random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>

      <title>Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. The Bayesian analysis yields the NMEs 4.33(5) for $^{136}$Xe and 5.51(14) for $^{150}$Nd. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>The Smile of Cheshire Cat At High Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryons in finite nuclei, nuclear matter and dense compact-star matter are described in terms of Cheshire Cat for QCD. A potential conceptual link, admittedly short in mathematical rigor, between their manifestations is made by what's called Cheshire Cat Principle. Put in terms taken ``dual" to QCD variables, going to very high density exposes quantum Hall droplets -- or pancakes -- at which the dilaton-limit fixed point with $g_A\to 1$, $f_\pi\to f_\chi$ -- where $f_\pi$ and $f_\chi$ are respectively the pion and dilaton decay constants -- and the baryon parity-doubling are reached. This scenario suggests a thus-far totally unexplored structure of dual baryonic matter at high density which does neither require nor rule out (rapid) first-order phase transitions from hadrons to quarks in the core of compact stars on the verge of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Multiboson Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations for partially coherent sources in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model to study multi-pion and multi-kaon Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) correlations for the partially coherent particle-emitting sources in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A density-dependent longitudinal coherent emission length and density-dependent transverse coherent emission length are introduced in calculating the multi-boson HBT correlation functions of the partially coherent sources. We compare the model results of three- and four-pion HBT correlation functions with experimental data in Pb-Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV, and investigate the influences of boson coherent emissions on the multi-pion and multi-kaon correlation functions, respectively. We find that all of the three- and four-pion correlation functions of the partially coherent sources are consistent with experimental data. Coherent emission leads to the intercept decreases of the multi-boson correlation functions. The intercepts of the multi-kaon correlation functions of the partially coherent source are higher than those of the multi-pion correlation functions, because low kaon densities lead to smaller kaon coherent emission lengths than pion emission lengths. The intercepts of multi-boson correlation functions of partially coherent sources in high transverse momentum intervals are higher than those in low transverse momentum intervals because particle de Broglie wavelengths are small at high momenta.</description>

      <title>Practical Dirac Majorana confusion theorem: Issues and Applicability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05654v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We inspect the model-independent study of practical Dirac Majorana confusion theorem (pDMCT) -- a wide spread belief that the difference between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos via any kinematical observable would be practically impossible to determine because of the difference only being proportional to the square of neutrino mass -- in context of processes that have at least a neutrino antineutrino pair in their final state. We scrutinize the domain of applicability of pDMCT and also highlight those aspects that are often misunderstood. We try to clarify some of the frequently used concepts that are used to assert pDMCT as a generic feature irrespective of the process, or observable, such as the existence of any analytic continuity between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in the limit mass(neutrino) -&gt; 0. In summary, we illustrate that pDMCT is not any fundamental property of neutrinos, instead, it is a phenomenological feature of neutrino non-observation, depending on models and processes.</description>

      <title>Exotic Stable Branches with Efficient TOV Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern inference schemes for the neutron star equation of state (EoS) require large numbers of stellar models constructed with different EoS, and these stellar models must capture all the behavior of stable stars. I introduce termination conditions for sequences of stellar models for cold, non-rotating neutron stars that can identify all stable stellar configurations up to arbitrarily large central pressures along with an efficient algorithm to build accurate interpolators for macroscopic properties. I explore the behavior of stars with both high- and low-central pressures. Interestingly, I find that EoS with monotonically increasing sound-speed can produce multiple stable branches (twin stars) and that large phase transitions at high densities can produce stable branches at nearly any mass scale, including sub-solar masses, while still supporting stars with $M &gt; 2\,M_\odot$. I conclude with some speculation about the astrophysical implications of this behavior.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>
