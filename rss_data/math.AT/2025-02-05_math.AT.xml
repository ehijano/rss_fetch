      <title>The Induced Matching Distance: A Novel Topological Metric with Applications in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the induced matching distance, a novel topological metric designed to compare discrete structures represented by a symmetric non-negative function. We apply this notion to analyze agent trajectories over time. We use dynamic time warping to measure trajectory similarity and compute the 0-dimensional persistent homology to identify relevant connected components, which, in our context, correspond to groups of similar trajectories. To track the evolution of these components across time, we compute induced matching distances, which preserve the coherence of their dynamic behavior. We then obtain a 1-dimensional signal that quantifies the consistency of trajectory groups over time. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively differentiates between various agent behaviors, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for topological analysis in robotics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology on a lattice of multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multicomplex structure is defined from an ordered lattice of multigraphs. This structure will help us to observe the features of Persistent Homology in this context, its interaction with the ordering and the repercussions of the process of merging multigraphs in the calculation of the Betti numbers. For the latter, an extended version of the incremental algorithm is provided. The ideas here developed are mainly oriented to the original example described in [10] and used more extensively in [11] in the context of the formalization of the notion of embodiment in Neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Inferring Ambient Cycles of Point Samples on Manifolds with Universal Coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central objective of topological data analysis is to identify topologically significant features in data represented as a finite point cloud. We consider the setting where the ambient space of the point sample is a compact Riemannian manifold. Given a simplicial complex constructed on the point set, we can relate the first homology of the complex with that of the ambient manifold by matching edges in the complex with minimising geodesics between points. Provided the universal covering of the manifold is known, we give a constructive method for identifying whether a given edge loop (or representative first homology cycle) on the complex corresponds to a non-trivial loop (or first homology class) of the ambient manifold. We show that metric data on the point cloud and its fibre in the covering suffices for the construction, and formalise our approach in the framework of groupoids and monodromy of coverings.</description>

      <title>Some topological genera and Jacobi forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02432v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit and elucidate the $\widehat{A}$-genus, Hirzebruch's $L$-genus and Witten's $W$-genus, cobordism invariants of special classes of manifolds. After slight modification, involving Hecke's trick, we find that the $\widehat{A}$-genus and $L$-genus arise directly from Jacobi's theta function. In this way, for every $k\geq 0,$ we obtain exact formulas for the quasimodular expressions of $\widehat{A}_k$ and $L_k$ as ``traces'' of partition Eisenstein series \[\widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)= \operatorname{Tr}_k(\phi_{\widehat{A}};\tau)\ \ \ \ \ \ {\text {\rm and}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \mathcal{L}_k(\tau)= \operatorname{Tr}_k(\phi_L;\tau). \] Surprisingly, Ramanujan defined twists of the $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}_k(\tau)$ in his ``lost notebook'' in his study of derivatives of theta functions, decades before Borel and Hirzebruch rediscovered them in the context of spin manifolds. In addition, we show that the nonholomorphic $G_2^{\star}$-completion of the characteristic series of the Witten genus is the Jacobi theta function avatar of the $\widehat{A}$-genus.</description>

      <title>Quadratically Enriched Plane Curve Counting via Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the quadratically enriched count of rational curves in a smooth toric del Pezzo surface passing through $k$-rational points and pairs of conjugate points in quadratic field extensions $k\subset k(\sqrt{d_i})$ can be determined by counting certain tropical stable maps through vertically stretched point conditions with a suitable multiplicity. Building on the floor diagram technique in tropical geometry, we provide an algorithm to compute these numbers.
  Our tropical algorithm computes not only these new quadratically enriched enumerative invariants, but simultaneously also the complex Gromov-Witten invariant, the real Welschinger invariant counting curves satisfying real point conditions only, the real Welschinger invariant of curves satisfying pairs of complex conjugate and real point conditions, and the quadratically enriched count of curves satisfying $k$-rational point conditions.</description>

      <title>A model for framed configuration spaces of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.08319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study configuration spaces of framed points on oriented closed smooth manifolds. Such configuration spaces admit natural actions of the framed little discs operads, that play an important role in the study of embedding spaces of manifolds and in factorization homology. We construct real combinatorial models for these operadic modules, for orientable closed smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>Point-Level Topological Representation Learning on Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) allows us to extract powerful topological and higher-order information on the global shape of a data set or point cloud. Tools like Persistent Homology or the Euler Transform give a single complex description of the global structure of the point cloud. However, common machine learning applications like classification require point-level information and features to be available. In this paper, we bridge this gap and propose a novel method to extract node-level topological features from complex point clouds using discrete variants of concepts from algebraic topology and differential geometry. We verify the effectiveness of these topological point features (TOPF) on both synthetic and real-world data and study their robustness under noise and heterogeneous sampling.</description>
