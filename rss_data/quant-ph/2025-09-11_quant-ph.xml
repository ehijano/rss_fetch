      <title>Circuit-Efficient Randomized Quantum Simulation of Non-Unitary Dynamics with Observable-Driven and Symmetry-Aware Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce random-LCHS, a circuit-efficient randomized-compilation framework for simulating linear non-unitary dynamics of the form $\partial_t u(t) = -A(t) u(t) + b(t)$ built on the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS). We propose three related settings: the general random-LCHS for time-dependent inhomogeneous linear dynamics; the observable-driven random-LCHS, which targets estimation of an observable's expectation at the final time; and the symmetric random-LCHS, a time-independent, homogeneous reduction that can exploit physical symmetries. Our contributions are threefold: first, by randomizing the outer linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) layer as well as the deterministic inner Hamiltonian simulation layer, random-LCHS attains favorable resource overheads in the circuit design for early fault-tolerant devices; second, the observable-driven variant employs an unbiased Monte-Carlo estimator to target expectation values directly, reducing sample complexity; and third, integrating the physical symmetry in the model with the sampling scheme yields further empirical improvements, demonstrating tighter error bounds in realistic numerics. We illustrate these techniques with theoretical guarantees as well as numerical verifications and discuss implementation trade-offs for near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity of topological phases. Or lack thereof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</description>

      <title>Cloning Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of deterministically cloning quantum channels with respect to the best attainable rate and the highest quality, so-called optimal cloning. We demonstrate that cloning quantum states is, in-fact, equivalent to cloning the trash-and-replace channel and therefore the former is a special case of the more general problem. By appealing to higher-order quantum operations (quantum processes) we construct a unified framework to deal with the most general cloning tasks and establish necessary conditions for a family of channels to exhibit super-replication -- a quadratic cloning rate with vanishing error. We find that noisy phase-gate channels satisfy these conditions, and we construct the explicit super-replicating process for the task. Conversely, we find that the criteria are not met by the full set of noisy unitary gates; classical noise channels; or amplitude damping channels, whose respective cloning rates are at most linear. In this paradigm, we not only derive new results, but also refigure known ones. We derive a strong converse for state cloning, and for unitary channels we construct an alternative super-replication process to that of D\"ur et al. [PRL 114, 120503 (2015)] and Chiribella et al. [PRL 114, 120504 (2015)] based on a measure-and-prepare process, which allows us to establish a direct connection between optimal channel cloning and Bayesian channel estimation. Finally we give an SDP algorithm to search for optimal cloning processes and study the advantage of coherent vs measure-and-prepare protocols on concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Free Cumulants and Full Eigenstate Thermalization from Boundary Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary-Based Circuit Optimization for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we evaluate an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to optimize a given circuit in such a way that it reduces the required communication when executed in the Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) paradigm. We evaluate our approach for a state preparation task using Grover circuits and show that it is able to reduce the required global gates by more than 89% while still achieving high fidelity as well as the ability to extract the correct solution to the given problem. We also apply the approach to reduce circuit depth and number of CX gates. Additionally, we run experiments in which a circuit is optimized for a given network topology after each qubit has been assigned to specific nodes in the network. In these experiments, the algorithm is able to reduce the communication cost (i.e., number of hops between QPUs) by up to 19%.</description>

      <title>Entanglement distribution modeling with quantum memories in a global and local clock system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an innovative model for predicting entanglement distribution between end parties of a quantum network using our in-house simulation algorithm. Our implementation is based on stochastic methods that are built upon a unique global and local clock system for monitoring expectations with finite quantum memory (QM) parameters. This allows us to tabulate rates with independently operating quantum repeater nodes in a distribution chain. The numerical simulations presented utilize a stochastic modeling of QM efficiency and storage lifetime. The findings presented reveal the translation of the effects of QM lifetime on the spread of time needed for successful entanglement distribution between end parties. Our model based on this transformative clock scheme will make an impactful addition to quantum network simulators platforms.</description>

      <title>RAPID Quantum Detection and Demodulation of Covert Communications: Breaking the Noise Limit with Solid-State Spin Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for the detection and demodulation of covert electromagnetic signals using solid-state spin sensors. Our approach, named RAPID, is a two-stage hybrid strategy that leverages nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to operate below the classical noise floor employing a robust adaptive policy via imitation and distillation. We first formulate the joint detection and estimation task as a unified stochastic optimal control problem, optimizing a composite Bayesian risk objective under realistic physical constraints. The RAPID algorithm solves this by first computing a robust, non-adaptive baseline protocol grounded in the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), and then using this baseline to warm-start an online, adaptive policy learned via deep reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic). This method dynamically optimizes control pulses, interrogation times, and measurement bases to maximize information gain while actively suppressing non-Markovian noise and decoherence. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the protocol achieves a significant sensitivity gain over static methods, maintains high estimation precision in correlated noise environments, and, when applied to sensor arrays, enables coherent quantum beamforming that achieves Heisenberg-like scaling in precision. This work establishes a theoretically rigorous and practically viable pathway for deploying quantum sensors in security-critical applications such as electronic warfare and covert surveillance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrix via its classical counterpart from random measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preconditioning with the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is a popular approach in quantum variational algorithms. Yet the QFIM is costly to obtain directly, usually requiring more state preparation than its classical counterpart: the classical Fisher information matrix (CFIM). We rigorously prove that averaging the classical Fisher information matrix over Haar-random measurement bases yields $\mathbb{E}_{U\sim\mu_H}[F^U(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = \frac{1}{2}Q(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ for pure states in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Furthermore, we obtain the variance of CFIM ($O(N^{-1})$) and establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds ($\exp(-\Theta(N)t^2)$), demonstrating that using few random measurement bases is sufficient to approximate the QFIM accurately, especially in high-dimensional settings. This work establishes a solid theoretical foundation for efficient quantum natural gradient methods via randomized measurements.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sum Capacity via Quantum and No-Signaling Cooperation Between Transmitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a communication scenario over a discrete memoryless interference channel or multiple access channel without feedback, where transmitters exploit classical, quantum, or no-signaling cooperation. In this scenario, several previous works have shown that the sum capacities of channels involving pseudo-telepathy games can be enhanced by quantum or no-signaling cooperation. However, a full characterization of which channels admit such an improvement remains open. By focusing on the common characteristics of previously studied channels, we propose a broader class of channels for which quantum or no-signaling cooperation increases the sum capacity. Channels in this class are associated with a pseudo-telepathy game, with channel inputs specified as tuples of questions and answers from the game. In addition, when the channel inputs satisfy the winning condition of the game, the channel decomposes into parallel weakly symmetric sub-channels and is less noisy compared to the case when the inputs do not meet the winning condition.</description>

      <title>Scalable Network of Mach-Zehnder Interferometers with a Single Entangled Resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing exploits entanglement to enhance the estimation of multiple parameters across a network of spatially-separated sensors, achieving sensitivities beyond the classical limit. Potential applications cover a plethora of technologies, from precision navigation to biomedical imaging and environmental monitoring. However, practical implementations are challenged by the complex optimal distribution of entanglement throughout the sensing nodes, which affects scalability and robustness. Here we demonstrate a reconfigurable network of Mach-Zehnder interferometers entangled via a single shared squeezed-vacuum resource. We achieve joint noise suppression of $4.36 \pm 0.35$ dB below the standard quantum limit at the phase-uncertainty level of $10^{-9}$ . Furthermore, after full optimization in the low-intensity regime, we demonstrate a crossover from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. The network estimates arbitrary linear combinations of phases, saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound in the ideal case, remains robust under realistic photon losses, and scales favorably with the number of sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of decision diagrams in quantum circuit analysis have been an active research area. Our work introduces FeynmanDD, a new method utilizing standard and multi-terminal decision diagrams for quantum circuit simulation and equivalence checking. Unlike previous approaches that exploit patterns in quantum states and operators, our method explores useful structures in the path integral formulation, essentially transforming the analysis into a counting problem. The method then employs efficient counting algorithms using decision diagrams as its underlying computational engine. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate FeynmanDD's capabilities and limitations in quantum circuit analysis, highlighting the value of this new BDD-based approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively utilize quantum incompatibility as a resource in quantum information processing, it is crucial to evaluate how incompatible a set of devices is. In this study, we propose an ordering to compare incompatibility and reveal its various properties based on the operational intuition that larger incompatibility can be detected with fewer states. We especially focus on typical class of incompatibility exhibited by mutually unbiased qubit observables and numerically demonstrate that the ordering yields new classifications among sets of devices. Moreover, the equivalence relation induced by this ordering is proved to uniquely characterize mutually unbiased qubit observables among all pairs of unbiased qubit observables. The operational ordering also has a direct implication for a specific protocol called distributed sampling.</description>

      <title>On the CQC Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CQC conjecture by Schneeloch et al. (Physical Review A 90.6, 2014) asserts that the sum of classical mutual information between two parties obtained by measuring individual systems in two mutually unbiased bases can not exceed their shared quantum mutual information. This remarkable conjecture, which deserves more work, still remains open. In this article, using a result by Coles and Piani (Physical Review A 89.2, 2014), we derive a sufficient condition for which the CQC conjecture holds. We show that this condition validates the conjecture for a wider class of states compared to the states that was mentioned in the original work. Furthermore, we extend this conjecture to higher number of mutually unbiased bases and prime dimensions. We prove this extended CQC conjecture on isotropic states of arbitrary prime dimensions and simulate it extensively for dimension 3 and 5 for random bipartite states, observing no contradiction.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Spectroscopy via Symmetry-Protected Destructive Many-Body Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramsey spectroscopy, a fundamental tool in both basic science and practical applications, is inevitably subject to several detrimental effects. %
Here we propose a symmetry-protected destructive many-body interferometry (SPDMBI) for Ramsey spectroscopy, which successfully mitigates the spectral shift caused by interparticle interaction, noise, decoherence and experimental imperfection. %
Through matching the symmetry of the input states and the Hamiltonian, the SPDMBI-based Ramsey spectroscopy yields an antisymmetric spectrum, whose antisymmetric point exactly determines the resonance frequency. %
In such a Ramsey spectroscopy, the population difference under resonance is always zero, which is a result of destructive quantum interferometry. %
To demonstrate its versatility, we showcase successful applications of symmetry-protected Ramsey spectroscopy in measuring both time-independent and time-dependent signals. %
Our protocol can improve the performance of Ramsey spectroscopy, which offers a pathway for various high-precision quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected many-body Ramsey spectroscopy: precision scaling and robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a powerful quantum resource for enhancing measurement precision beyond classical limit. %
Here we propose an entanglement-enhanced symmetry-protected destructive many-body Ramsey interferometry for precise parameter estimation. %
Through matching the symmetry of input states and Hamiltonian, the spectral shift of Ramsey spectroscopy caused by interparticle interaction, noise, decoherence and experimental imperfection can be mitigated for both time-independent and time-dependent signals, as explored in the companion Letter [S. Chen, et al., Ramsey Spectroscopy via Symmetry-Protected Destructive Many-Body Interferometry (submitted)]. %
In this work, we show that symmetric entangled input states can further improve the measurement precision of symmetry-protected Ramsey spectroscopy without affecting the measurement accuracy. %
Through inputting spin cat states and applying suitable interaction-based readout operations, the measurement precisions of time-independent and time-dependent signals can both approach the Heisenberg limit. %
In particular, we systematically analyze how precision scaling and robustness depend on the input states, parameters, experimental imperfection and decoherence. %
This work establishes a practical pathway to Heisenberg-limited quantum metrology with many-body Ramsey interferometry, offering resilience against realistic noise and imperfections.</description>

Abstract: Spin-squeezed states constitute a valuable entanglement resource capable of surpassing the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, spin-squeezed states only enable sub-SQL uncertainty within a narrow parametric window near some specific points. Identifying optimal measurement protocols for spin-squeezed states remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present an adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation protocol that achieves optimal measurement precision with spin-squeezed states under noises. Our protocol operates by maintaining measurements near the optimal point and employing Bayesian inference to sequentially perform phase estimation, enabling robust high-precision measurement. To account for realistic experimental conditions, we explicitly incorporate phase noises into the Bayesian likelihood function for more accurate estimation. Our protocol can be applied to various scenarios, such as quantum gravimeters and atomic clocks, achieving precision enhancement over conventional fitting methods under noises. Our approach offers superior precision and enhanced robustness against noises, making it highly promising for squeezing-enhanced quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>The Born rule as a natural transformation of functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the quantum mechanical notions of density operator, positive operator-valued measure (POVM), and the Born rule, are all simultaneously encoded in the categorical notion of a natural transformation of functors. In particular, we show that given a fixed quantum system, there exists an explicit bijection from the set of density operators on the associated Hilbert space to the set of natural transformations between the canonical measurement and probability functors associated with the system, which formalize the way in which quantum effects (i.e., POVM elements) and their associated probabilities are additive with respect to a coarse-graining of measurements.</description>

      <title>Towards solving industrial integer linear programs with Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization via decoded quantum interferometry (DQI) has recently gained a great deal of attention as a promising avenue for solving optimization problems using quantum computers. In this paper, we apply DQI to an industrial optimization problem in the automotive industry: the vehicle option-package pricing problem. Our main contributions are 1) formulating the industrial problem as an integer linear program (ILP), 2) converting the ILP into instances of max-XORSAT, and 3) developing a detailed quantum circuit implementation for belief propagation, a heuristic algorithm for decoding LDPC codes. Thus, we provide a full implementation of the DQI algorithm using Belief Propagation, which can be applied to any industrially relevant ILP by first transforming it into a max-XORSAT instance. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our implementation by benchmarking it against both Gurobi and a random sampling baseline.</description>

      <title>Atomic diffraction by patterned holes in hexagonal boron nitride: a comparison between semi-classical and quantum computational models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffraction of atoms and molecules through tiny, sub-nanometre holes in atomically thin membranes is a promising approach for advancing atom interferometry sensing and atomic holography. However, dispersion interactions, such as the Casimir-Polder force, pose a significant challenge by attracting diffracting particles to the membrane, limiting the minimum hole size. This paper presents a numerical simulation of helium matter-wave diffraction through sub-nanometre holes in hexagonal boron nitride by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Our results show that the transmission rates in the quantum approach are significantly higher than those predicted by the commonly used semi-classical approach. This suggests that significantly smaller holes can be used in the design of diffractive masks, provided that fabrication techniques can meet the atomic-level precision to realise such holes. Furthermore, we observe notable differences in diffraction patterns, even for atom velocities that are much greater than the expected convergence threshold between semi-classical and quantum computational models.</description>

      <title>Persistent-DPO: A novel loss function and hybrid learning for generative quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generative quantum eigensolver (GQE)~\cite{nakaji2024generative}, which trains a classical generative model to produce quantum circuits with desired properties such as describing molecular ground states. We introduce two methods to improve GQE. First, we identify a limitation of direct preference optimization (DPO) when used as the loss function in GQE, and propose Persistent-DPO (P-DPO) as a solution to this limitation. Second, as a method to improve the online learning during the training phase of GQE, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines online and offline learning. Using a transformer decoder implementation of GQE, we evaluate our methods through ground state search experiments on the $\mathrm{BeH_2^{}}$ molecule and observe that P-DPO achieves lower energies than DPO. The hybrid approach further improves convergence and final energy values, particularly with P-DPO.</description>

      <title>From Physical to Logical: Graph-State-Based Connectivity in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in quantum communication, but bipartite schemes are often insufficient for advanced protocols like quantum secret sharing or distributed computing. Graph states offer a flexible way to represent and manage multipartite entanglement in quantum networks, enabling logical connectivity through local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In this work, we extend existing approaches based on bi-star configurations to more complex multi-star topologies. We analyze the maximum connectivity that can be achieved in networks of $m$ switches, each connected to $n$ clients, including asymmetric cases where the number of clients varies per switch. We also propose methods to enable logical communication between distant nodes. Our results support the development of scalable quantum networks with rich connectivity beyond traditional bipartite structures.</description>

      <title>LLM-Guided Ans\"atze Design for Quantum Circuit Born Machines in Financial Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum generative modeling using quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) shows promising potential for practical quantum advantage. However, discovering ans\"atze that are both expressive and hardware-efficient remains a key challenge, particularly on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce a prompt-based framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware-aware QCBM architectures. Prompts are conditioned on qubit connectivity, gate error rates, and hardware topology, while iterative feedback, including Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, circuit depth, and validity, is used to refine the circuits. We evaluate our method on a financial modeling task involving daily changes in Japanese government bond (JGB) interest rates. Our results show that the LLM-generated ans\"atze are significantly shallower and achieve superior generative performance compared to the standard baseline when executed on real IBM quantum hardware using 12 qubits. These findings demonstrate the practical utility of LLM-driven quantum architecture search and highlight a promising path toward robust, deployable generative models for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Addressing requirements for crosstalk-free quantum-gate operation in many-body nanofiber cavity QED systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed network architecture in which flying photons connect individual modules containing stationary atomic qubits is a promising approach for scaling up neutral-atom based quantum-computing platforms. We consider an all-fiber based platform consisting of nanofiber cavity QED systems interconnected via conventional optical fibers. Each nanofiber cavity is strongly coupled to multiple atoms through its evanescent field, and atom pairs within one cavity (local) or two distant cavities (remote) are addressed for performing photon-mediated quantum logic gates on them by controlling the effective light-matter coupling via local AC Stark shifts and atom-fiber distance. We numerically evaluate the required parameters for achieving nearly crosstalk-free gate operation using these targeting methods by calculating average gate fidelities, success probabilities, and Pauli error rates for both local and remote controlled-Z gates. For the case of perfect addressing, we also analytically determine the theoretical optimum gate performance as limited by cavity reflectivity, cooperativity, and qubit level-splitting.</description>

      <title>Realizing the Haldane Model in Thermal Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials hold great promise for developing next-generation devices with transport properties that remain resilient in the presence of local imperfections. However, their susceptibility to thermal noise has posed a major challenge. In particular, the Haldane model, a cornerstone in topological physics, generally requires cryogenic temperatures for experimental realization, limiting both the investigation of topologically robust quantum phenomena and their practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature realization of the Haldane model using atomic ensembles in momentum-space superradiance lattices, a platform intrinsically resistant to thermal noise. The topological phase transition is revealed through the superradiant emission contrast between two timed Dicke states in the lattice. Crucially, the thermal resilience of this platform allows us to access a deep modulation regime, where topological transitions to high Chern number phases emerge -- going beyond the traditional Haldane model. Our results not only deepen the understanding of exotic topological phases, but also offer a robust, reconfigurable, and room-temperature-compatible platform that connects quantum simulation to real-world quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Frequency drift corrected ultra-stable laser through phase-coherent fiber producing a quantum channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase coherent fibers (PCF) are essential to distribute nearly monochromatic photons, ultra-stable in their frequency and phases, which have demanding requirements for state-of-the-art networked experiments, quantum as well as very high-speed communications. We report the development of a novel system that produces PCF links, also actively corrects the unavoidable slow frequency drift of the source laser. The PCF follows white phase noise limited $\sigma_o \times \tau^{-1}$ stability behavior having $\sigma_o$ values $1.9(2) \times 10^{-16}$ and $2.6(1) \times 10^{-16}$ for a 3.3 km field-deployed and 71 km spool fibers, respectively, with up to 47.5 dB suppression of the phase noise compared to a normal fiber. Additionally, the system is featured to correct the source laser's 33.8 mHz/s frequency drift to as low as $\simeq 0.05$ mHz/s. Therefore, this all-in-one solution producing a quantum link can potentially enhance the effectiveness of the twin field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) by nearly a 73-fold reduction of the QBER that arises from using unstabilized fiber links, as well as relaxes the laser frequency drift correction constraints by severalfold.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum algorithms: Worst-case fidelity bounds and implications for design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Errors occurring on noisy hardware pose a key challenge to reliable quantum computing. Existing techniques such as error correction, mitigation, or suppression typically separate the error handling from the algorithm analysis and design. In this paper, we develop an alternative, algorithm-centered framework for understanding and improving the robustness against errors. For a given quantum algorithm and error model, we derive worst-case fidelity bounds which can be explicitly computed to certify the robustness. We consider general error models including coherent and (Markovian) incoherent errors and allowing for set-based error descriptions to address uncertainty or time-dependence in the errors. Our results give rise to guidelines for robust algorithm design and compilation by optimizing our theoretical robustness measure. Numerical results on algorithm analysis and robust optimization demonstrate the practicality of the framework.</description>

      <title>A relational critique of Bell locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic analysis of Bell experiments from the relational perspective, demonstrating that the apparent ``nonlocality'' of quantum mechanics stems from a problematic application of relativistic principles rather than mysterious space-like influences. We show that when Bell experiments are properly analysed through individual observer accounts, all measurements remain strictly local. Alice's and Bob's local measurements can be fully understood in terms of variables from their backward light cones, satisfying relativistic causality. Correlations emerge only in the global perspective of an external observer Charlie when analyzing joint measurement statistics -- a physical situation different from the individual space-like separated measurements to which Bell's locality condition was originally applied.
  Our central contribution is identifying a conceptual shortcoming in Bell's argument, namely, the illegitimate extension of local independence principles from individual measurements to correlation measurements. The fact that space-like separated events cannot causally influence each other does not justify requiring statistical independence in global correlation analyses. Motivated by the formalism developed in the companion paper \cite{NeeWaa-indisc}, we arrive at the construction of an explicit classical probability model that reproduces all the experimental results of the Bell experiment, including the violation of the CHSH inequality $S\leq2$.</description>

      <title>Parametric resonance and nonlinear dynamics in a coupled double-pendulum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics plays a significant role in interdisciplinary fields spanning biology, engineering, mathematics, and physics. Under small-amplitude approximations, certain nonlinear systems can be effectively described by the linear Mathieu equation, which is widely recognized for modeling the response of systems with periodically modulated parameters. Here we investigated a collision-coupled double pendulum system within the framework of Lagrangian mechanics, further explored the nonlinear dynamical characteristics and parametric resonance phenomena at large angular displacements-features that cannot be described by the Mathieu equation alone. Our experiments demonstrate that parametric resonance consistently occurs within a characteristic frequency ratio range ($ \omega /{{\omega }_{0}} $) starting from 2, in agreement with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. We also find, under periodic driving at moderate frequencies, the system requires initial perturbations to stabilize into periodic states. We propose a novel example in nonlinear dynamics demonstrating large-amplitude parametric resonance phenomena, which also serves as an experimental and theoretical paradigm for exploring classical-quantum correspondences in time crystal research.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Compatibility-Based Childcare Support Service using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary Japan, isolated parenting has become a serious social issue, increasing psychological stress on parents and potentially affecting children's development. Existing childcare support services tend to focus on physical assistance, while psychological support and community connections remain insufficient. To address this gap, we developed a service that connects parents with senior community members who have parenting experience, aiming to provide psychological support and foster intergenerational exchange. Achieving high-quality matching requires considering pair compatibility, balancing supporter workload, and handling scheduling constraints, which can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. We designed a matching framework using the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation and evaluated quantum annealing (QA) against simulated annealing (SA). QA achieved higher solution quality and diversity, particularly for larger problem instances. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept field experiment conducted in Sendai City, Japan, demonstrated that the framework can generate multiple high-quality matching candidates, enabling flexible scheduling in real-world operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a comprehensive study of optimization algorithms for the calibration of quantum devices. As part of our ongoing efforts to automate bring-up, tune-up, and system identification procedures, we investigate a broad range of optimizers within a simulated environment designed to closely mimic the challenges of real-world experimental conditions. Our benchmark includes widely used algorithms such as Nelder-Mead and the state-of-the-art Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). We evaluate performance in both low-dimensional settings, representing simple pulse shapes used in current optimal control protocols with a limited number of parameters, and high-dimensional regimes, which reflect the demands of complex control pulses with many parameters. Based on our findings, we recommend the CMA-ES algorithm and provide empirical evidence for its superior performance across all tested scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Having multiple Bell pairs shared by distant quantum registers provides a key resource for both quantum networks and distributed quantum computing. In this paper, we present a protocol for parallelized Bell-pair generation that uses the phase of a coherent light pulse to encode a qudit, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple Bell pairs. By encoding a qudit in a basis of light-matter Schr\"odinger's cat states, the loss of a photon in transit can be detected through an $XX$ parity syndrome, allowing the backaction due to the lost photon to be deterministically corrected through single-qubit rotations. The protocol presented here is compatible with existing technologies in both optical and microwave (circuit QED) architectures, supporting near-term implementation across diverse quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Spectral Transitions of the Entanglement Hamiltonian in Monitored Free Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored free fermions through the spectral and eigenstate properties of the entanglement Hamiltonian. By analyzing entanglement scaling, we identify three non-trivial fixed points, for which the entanglement follows exact analytical scaling forms: chaotic unitary dynamics at infinitesimal monitoring, characterized by a Gaussian Page law; a Fermi-liquid fixed point at moderate monitoring, defining a metallic phase with logarithmic entanglement growth and emergent space-time invariance; and a quantum Lifshitz fixed point marking the measurement-induced phase transition into a localized area-law phase. Adopting a random-matrix perspective on the entanglement Hamiltonian, we show that short-range spectral correlations, such as the adjacent gap ratio $\langle \tilde r\rangle$ and the Kullback-Leibler divergence $KL_1$, sharply detect an ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition at the quantum Lifshitz fixed point, and yield precise estimates of the critical point and correlation length exponent. Long-range probes, including the spectral form factor and the associated Thouless time, corroborate this picture, while the variant $KL_2$ uncovers signatures of a possible non-ergodic extended (multifractal) regime at intermediate monitoring strengths. Together, these results establish the entanglement Hamiltonian as a powerful framework for diagnosing metallic, localized, and multifractal regimes in monitored quantum dynamics, and highlight unexpected scaling structures, Fermi-liquid and Lifshitz criticality, that lie beyond current field-theoretic approaches.</description>

      <title>Computation of operator exponentials using the Dunford-Cauchy integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an n-qubit quantum system with a Hamiltonian, defined by an expansion in the Pauli basis, and propose a new algorithm for classical computing the exponential of the Hamiltonian. The algorithm is based on the representation of the exponential by the Dunford-Cauchy integral, followed by an efficient computation of the resolvent, and is suitable for Hamiltonians that are sparse in the Pauli basis. The practical efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by two illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Cat states in one- and two-mode $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate one- and two-mode variants of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric quantum Rabi model, which describe the interaction of a qutrit with one or two bosonic modes and are directly relevant for circuit-QED and spin-qudit platforms. We find a canonical transformation that allows one to obtain the spectrum of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Rabi model using perturbation theory in a magnetic field. We show that in a certain parameter regime (deep-strong-coupling and a small magnetic field) the three lowest eigenstates become $\mathbb{Z}_3$ qutrit-boson cat states. In order to characterize these states we introduce a joint qutrit-boson Wigner function and derive its closed-form expression for the qutrit-boson cat states. Numerical calculations across a wide range of coupling strengths show that the proposed Wigner function is a useful tool that allows one to unambiguously identify the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ qutrit-boson cat states.</description>

      <title>No Bound Randomness in Quantum Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it has been found that there exist maximally nonlocal quantum correlations that fail to certify randomness for any fixed input pair, rendering them useless for device-independent spot-checking randomness expansion schemes. Here we show that conversely, in DI randomness amplification protocols where all input pairs are used for randomness generation, any amount of quantum nonlocality is sufficient to certify randomness. This shows that no bound randomness exists in quantum nonlocality - any quantum nonlocal behavior is useful in a DI randomness generation task with appropriate modification of protocol structure. Secondly, we show that in contrast to the hitherto considered fixed-input guessing probability, the average guessing probability over all inputs is a faithful and monotonic measure of nonlocality. We use the average guessing probability to show that in contrast to findings in PRL 134, 090201, the detection efficiency threshold for randomness generation is never lower than that for nonlocality detection. Finally, we analytically compute the average guessing probability by a quantum adversary of a single player's measurement outputs in a standard CHSH Bell test, and use it to demonstrate an improvement in the generation rate in state-of-art amplification protocols.</description>

      <title>Construction of Kochen-Specker Sets from Mutually Unbiased Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic, constructive analysis of Kochen-Specker contextuality, emphasizing the foundational importance of complete orthogonal bases (contexts). First, in three dimensions, we generate a complete inventory of 165 rays and 130 bases from mutually unbiased bases. This unified framework reveals that several known constructions are equivalent manifestations of a minimal 69-ray, 50-context Kochen--Specker nucleus and uncovers a striking 40-4-4 generative asymmetry among the mutual unbiased bases, which we explain via the algebraic exclusivity of the Fourier basis. Second; in higher dimensions (D=4, 5), we develop explicit "forcing gadgets" that use orthogonality constraints to compel a central vector into a state of maximal unbiasedness. We demonstrate that our 20-vector gadget in D=4 and the 18-vector Cabello set are informationally equivalent subsets of the Peres--Mermin eigensystem, yet differ in their contextuality due to the choice of basis completions. Our findings establish that contexts, not merely intertwining vectors, are the crucial carriers of Kochen-Specker type logic and are indispensable for a rigorous assessment of quantum contextuality.</description>

      <title>Robust Belief-State Policy Learning for Quantum Network Routing Under Decoherence and Time-Varying Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a feature-based Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework for quantum network routing, combining belief-state planning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address partial observability, decoherence, and scalability challenges in dynamic quantum systems. Our approach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement degradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature space, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies, coupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with GNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and robustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100 nodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high decoherence and nonstationary conditions.</description>

      <title>How to simulate magic state cultivation with around $8$ Clifford terms on average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon [arXiv:2509.01224], we present a sketch on how to simulate the non-Clifford $d=5$ magic state cultivation circuits [arXiv:2409.17595] with a sum of $\approx 8$ Clifford ZX-diagrams on average, at $0.1\%$ noise. Compared to a magic cat state stabiliser decomposition of all $53$ non-Clifford spiders ($6{,}377{,}292$ terms required), this is more than $7 \times 10^{5}$ times reduction in the number of terms. Our stabiliser decomposition has the advantage of representing the final non-Clifford state (in light of circuit errors) as a sum of Clifford ZX-diagrams. This will be useful in simulating the escape stage of magic state cultivation, where one need to port the resultant state of cultivation into a larger Clifford circuit with many more qubits. Still, it's necessary to only track $\approx 8$ Clifford terms. Our result sheds light on the simulability of operationally relevant, high $T$-count quantum circuits with some internal structure.</description>

      <title>Power and limitations of distributed quantum state purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state purification, which mitigates noise by exploiting multiple noisy copies of unknown states, has applications in quantum communication and computation with imperfect devices. Despite its importance, the fundamental capabilities and limitations of purification in distributed quantum systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically study distributed quantum state purification under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We prove that no nontrivial two-to-one LOCC purification protocol exists for three fundamental sets: all pure states, all maximally entangled states, and the four Bell states. This no-go theorem demonstrates that no LOCC protocol can reduce noise for every state within these sets, even probabilistically. In stark contrast, we show that single-state purification is achievable, and we provide an explicit analytical LOCC protocol for individual target states. For arbitrary state sets, we develop an optimization-based algorithm that systematically designs LOCC purification protocols, demonstrating its efficacy through concrete examples. These results delineate the fundamental boundaries of LOCC-based purification and provide practical strategies for noise reduction in distributed quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantum Computers: decoding and state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting with a standard computer can enhance the capabilities of current quantum computers already today, particularly by offloading certain computations to the standard computer. Quantum computers that interact with standard computers to perform computations are called adaptive quantum computers. This work formalizes a model that describes these adaptive quantum computers. As quantum computers are still under development, this work focuses on computations that terminate after a fixed number of steps, as that makes their implementation likely easier in practice.
  First, we show that adaptive quantum computers are more powerful than standard computers with respect to the practical problem of retrieving information from corrupted digital data. Standard computers struggle to retrieve such information within a fixed number of computation steps. The proof uses a structure-versus-randomness approach that splits the problem in a structured and a random-like component. The potential of adaptive quantum computations follows from a specific example where information is retrieved from corrupted data. Additionally, adaptive quantum computers can even improve standard computations for this problem that are not constrained by a fixed number of computation steps.
  Next, we show how adaptive quantum computations can improve non-adaptive quantum computations when preparing specific quantum states. We present efficient adaptive quantum algorithms to prepare the uniform superposition state, the GHZ state, the W-state and the Dicke state. These states are often used in other quantum algorithms, so having efficient routines for preparing them also enhances the efficiency of other algorithms. This work concludes by comparing these adaptive quantum computations with non-adaptive ones, analyzing their performance both theoretically and through quantum hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Implementing a Universal Set of Geometric Quantum Gates through Dressed-State assisted STA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric quantum computation relies on the geometric phase that arises in adiabatic cyclic evolutions of non-degenerate quantum systems, enabling the design of robust quantum gates. However, the adiabatic condition requires long evolution times, making the system vulnerable to decoherence. In this work, we propose a scheme to realize fast and high-fidelity geometric quantum gates by applying the Superadiabatic Transitionless Driving (SATD) protocol within the dressed-state framework. We analyze the implementation of single-qubit gates in a two-level system driven by a microwave field, focusing in particular on the NV center in diamond. We show how the dynamical phase can be canceled to obtain purely geometric operations. The robustness of the gates is assessed under systematic errors and environmental decoherence, demonstrating high fidelities even in regimes with strong fluctuations. Finally, we extend the protocol to construct nontrivial two-qubit gates, highlighting its feasibility for scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A Pathway to Practical Quantum Advantage in Solving Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) promises to tackle classically intractable problems. A key milestone is solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), which has remained formidable for quantum algorithms due to their high input-output overhead and nonlinearity. Here, we establish a full-stack framework that charts a practical pathway to a quantum advantage for large-scale NSE simulation. Our approach integrates a spectral-based input/output algorithm, an explicit and synthesized quantum circuit, and a refined error-correction protocol. The algorithm achieves an end-to-end exponential speedup in asymptotic complexity, meeting the lower bound for general quantum linear system solvers. Through symmetry-based circuit synthesis and optimized error correction, we reduce the required logical and physical resources by two orders of magnitude. Our concrete resource analysis demonstrates that solving NSE on a $2^{80}$-grid is feasible with 8.71 million physical qubits (at an error rate of $5 \times 10^{-4}$) in 42.6 days -- outperforming a state-of-the-art supercomputer, which would require over a century. This work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum speedup and the practical deployment of high-performance scientific computing.</description>

      <title>QCardEst/QCardCorr: Quantum Cardinality Estimation and Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is an important part of query optimization in DBMS. We develop a Quantum Cardinality Estimation (QCardEst) approach using Quantum Machine Learning with a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Network. We define a compact encoding for turning SQL queries into a quantum state, which requires only qubits equal to the number of tables in the query. This allows the processing of a complete query with a single variational quantum circuit (VQC) on current hardware. In addition, we compare multiple classical post-processing layers to turn the probability vector output of VQC into a cardinality value. We introduce Quantum Cardinality Correction QCardCorr, which improves classical cardinality estimators by multiplying the output with a factor generated by a VQC to improve the cardinality estimation. With QCardCorr, we have an improvement over the standard PostgreSQL optimizer of 6.37 times for JOB-light and 8.66 times for STATS. For JOB-light we even outperform MSCN by a factor of 3.47.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a robotic swarm, parameters such as position and proximity to the target can be described in terms of probability amplitudes. This idea led to recent studies on a quantum approach to the definition of the swarm, including a block-matrix representation. Here, we propose an advancement of the idea, defining a swarm as a mixed quantum state, to be described with a density matrix, whose size does not change with the number of robots. We end the article with some directions for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As ultracold atom experiments become highly controlled and scalable quantum simulators, they require sophisticated control over high-dimensional parameter spaces and generate increasingly complex measurement data that need to be analyzed and interpreted efficiently. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been established as versatile tools for addressing these challenges, offering strategies for data interpretation, experimental control, and theoretical modeling. In this review, we provide a perspective on how machine learning is being applied across various aspects of quantum simulation, with a focus on cold atomic systems. Emphasis is placed on practical use cases -- from classifying many-body phases to optimizing experimental protocols and representing quantum states -- highlighting the specific contexts in which different ML approaches prove effective. Rather than presenting algorithmic details, we focus on the physical insights enabled by ML and the kinds of problems in quantum simulation where these methods offer tangible benefits.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Entanglement Signal from Multipartite Entanglement of Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a signal $\Delta^{(3)}_p$ for genuine tripartite entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum systems and $\Delta^{(3)}_w$ for holographic systems. We prove that $\Delta^{(3)}_p$ is non-negative for any tripartite entangled mixed states. Based on the conjecture, the equality between an entanglement wedge cross section $E_w$ and entanglement of purification $E_p$, i.e., $E_w = E_P$ in the semiclassical limit, we apply the tripartite entanglement measure to study the structures of tripartite entanglement in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, especially for pure AdS$_3$. We comment on a generalization to $n$-partite entanglement signals $\Delta^{(n)}_p(A_1:\cdots:A_n)$.</description>

      <title>From Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling to soliton proliferation in Josephson junction arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Josephson junction arrays as realistic platforms for observing nonequilibrium scaling laws characterizing the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, and space-time soliton proliferation. Focusing on a two-chain ladder geometry, we perform numerical simulations for the roughness function. Together with analytical arguments, our results predict KPZ scaling at intermediate time scales, extending over sufficiently long time scales to be observable, followed by a crossover to the asymptotic long-time regime governed by soliton proliferation.</description>

      <title>Release and Recapture of Silica Nanoparticles from an Optical Trap in Weightlessness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically trapped Silica nanoparticles are a promising tool for precise sensing of gravitational or inertial forces and fundamental physics, including tests of quantum mechanics at 'large' mass scales. This field, called levitated optomechanics can greatly benefit from an application in weightlessness. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of such setups in a microgravity environment for the first time. Our experiment is operated in the GraviTower Bremen that provides up to 2.5 s of free fall. System performance and first release-recapture experiments, where the particle is no longer trapped are conducted in microgravity. This demonstration should also be seen in the wider context of preparing space missions on the topic of levitated optomechanics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) holds promise for optimization problems in quantum computing, especially for combinatorial optimization. This analog framework attracts attention for its potential to address complex problems. Its gate-based homologous, QAOA with proven performance, has brought lots of attention to the NISQ era. Several numerical benchmarks try to classify these two metaheuristics however, classical computational power highly limits the performance insights. In this work, we introduce a new parametrized version of QA enabling a precise 1-local analysis of the algorithm. We develop a tight Lieb-Robinson bound for regular graphs, achieving the best-known numerical value to analyze QA locally. Studying MaxCut over cubic graph as a benchmark optimization problem, we show that a linear-schedule QA with a 1-local analysis achieves an approximation ratio over 0.7020, outperforming any known 1-local algorithms.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced counter skin-effect and linear modes in non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. Numerical simulations thoroughly validate this exact solution. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the \emph{impurity-induced counter skin-effect}. These findings offer insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. We propose a possible implementation of this system for a non-Hermitian discrete-time quantum walk, and we demonstrate that an impurity-induced counter skin-effect also exists in multi-band models.</description>

      <title>When Quantum Nonlocality Does Not Play Dice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell inequality violations are often taken as evidence that quantum nonlocality guarantees intrinsic randomness, effectively playing the role of a "dice" at the heart of many device-independent cryptographic protocols. We show that there exist nontrivial Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by quantum correlations yet fail to certify randomness for any fixed input pair, rendering them useless for a large class of standard device-independent schemes. This is achieved through a systematic construction based on symmetric deterministic extensions of nonlocal games. We further construct maximally nonlocal quantum correlations that are deterministic for every fixed input pair, in the sense that for any chosen inputs they admit a convex decomposition into strategies with fixed outputs for those inputs. In the no-signalling framework, this property corresponds to the "bound randomness" of [Ac\'in et al., PRA 93, 012319 (2016)], where an adversary-once learning the inputs-can steer the correlations into a decomposition that makes the outputs fully predictable, thereby making them useless in most existing device-independent protocols. In contrast, bound randomness is impossible in quantum theory: any quantum correlations that become deterministic once the inputs are revealed must in fact be local. Our results pinpoint the precise limits of determinism compatible with quantum nonlocality.</description>

      <title>SDP bounds on quantum codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a semidefinite programming hierarchy based on state polynomial optimization to determine the existence of quantum codes with given parameters. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that a $(\!(n, K, {\delta})\!)_2$ code exists if and only if every level of the hierarchy is feasible. It is not limited to stabilizer codes and thus is applicable generally. While the machinery is formally dimension-free, we restrict it to qubit codes through quasi-Clifford algebras. We derive the quantum analog of a range of classical results: first, from an intermediate level a Lov\'asz bound for self-dual quan- tum codes is recovered. Second, a symmetrization of a minor variation of this Lov\'asz bound recovers the quantum Delsarte bound. Third, a symmetry reduction using the Terwilliger algebra leads to semidefinite programming bounds of size $O(n^4)$. With this we give an alternative proof that there is no $(\!(7, 1, 4)\!)_2$ quantum code, and show that $(\!(8, 9, 3)\!)_2$ and $(\!(10, 5, 4)\!)_2$ codes do not exist.</description>

      <title>On classical advice, sampling advice and complexity assumptions for learning separations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13880v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between advice in the form of a training set and classical advice. We do this by analyzing the class $\mathsf{BPP/samp}$ and certain variants of it. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that $\mathsf{BPP/samp}$ is a proper subset of the class $\mathsf{P/poly}$, which implies that advice in the form of a training set is strictly weaker than classical advice. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights from our proofs, we identify both sufficient and necessary complexity-theoretic assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up. We consider both the worst-case setting, where accurate results are required for all inputs, and the average-case setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a new approach to designing both algorithms and error detection codes for preparing approximate ground states of molecules. We propose a classical algorithm to find the optimal stabilizer state by using excitations of the Hartree-Fock state, followed by constructing quantum error-detection codes based on this stabilizer state using codeword-stabilized codes. Through various numerical experiments, we confirm that our method finds the best stabilizer approximations to the true ground states of molecules up to 36 qubits in size. Additionally, we construct generalized stabilizer states that offer a better approximation to the true ground states. Furthermore, for a simple noise model, we demonstrate that both the stabilizer and (some) generalized stabilizer states can be prepared with higher fidelity using the error-detection codes we construct. Our work represents a promising step toward designing algorithms for early fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the statistics of the results of a measurement of the spreading operator in the Krylov basis generated by the Hamiltonian of a quantum system starting from a specified initial pure state. We first obtain the probability distribution of the results of measurements of this spreading operator at a certain instant of time, and compute the characteristic function of this distribution. We show that the moments of this characteristic function are related to the so-called generalised spread complexities, and obtain expressions for them in several cases when the Hamiltonian is an element of a Lie algebra. Furthermore, by considering a continuum limit of the Krylov basis, we show that the generalised spread complexities of higher orders have a peak in the time evolution for a random matrix Hamiltonian belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble. We also obtain an upper bound on the change in generalised spread complexity at an arbitrary time in terms of the operator norm of the Hamiltonian and discuss the significance of these results.</description>

      <title>From Magic State Distillation to Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic State Distillation (MSD) has been a research focus for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the need for non-Clifford resource in gaining quantum advantage. Although many of the MSD protocols so far are based on stabilizer codes with transversal $T$ gates, there exists quite several protocols that don't fall into this class. Here we propose a method to map MSD protocols to iterative dynamical systems under the framework of stabilizer reduction. With the proposed mapping, we are able to analyze the performance of MSD protocols using techniques from dynamical systems theory, easily simulate the distillation process of input states under arbitrary noise and visualize it using flow diagram. We apply our mapping to common MSD protocols for $\ket{T}$ state and find some interesting properties: The $[[15, 1, 3]]$ code may distill states corresponding to $\sqrt{T}$ gate and the $[[5, 1, 3]]$ code can distill the magic state corresponding to the $T$ gate. Besides, we examine the exotic MSD protocols that may distill into other magic states proposed in [Eur. Phys. J. D 70, 55 (2016)] and identify the condition for distillable magic states. We also study new MSD protocols generated by concatenating different codes and numerically demonstrate that concatenation can generate MSD protocols with various magic states. By concatenating efficient codes with exotic codes, we can reduce the overhead of the exotic MSD protocols. We believe our proposed method will be a useful tool for simulating and visualization MSD protocols for canonical MSD protocols on $\ket{T}$ as well as other unexplored MSD protocols for other states.</description>

Abstract: We show that one can implement the Deutsch-Josza algorithm, one of the first and simplest quantum algorithms, in a fault-tolerant manner using the smallest quantum error-detecting code -- the $[[4,2,2]]$ code -- without any ancillae. We implemented the algorithm on a trapped-ion quantum computer with and without fault-tolerant encoding and compared the results. With approximately $99 \%$ confidence, we found that the fault-tolerant implementation provided a noise reduction for all oracles. Averaged across all oracles, the reduction in error rate was nearly $90 \%$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a quantum Otto-type heat engine constructed in an optomechanical system with which the cavity is chosen as the working substance. The cavity can effectively be coupled with hot thermal baths in nonequilibrium steady-states via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical mode with parametric drive fuels the cavity, and the utilization efficiency of energy is discussed. To obtain higher efficiency in finite time evolution, we use the shortcuts-to-adiabaticity method in work generation processes. The modified thermal efficiencies are obtained by numerical simulation. Such a system provides potential applications in quantum heat transfer and energy utilization in quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a real-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that simulates the dynamics of open quantum systems by stochastically compressing and evolving the density matrix under both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations. Our algorithm uses population dynamics to continuously suppress the sign problem, preventing its accumulation throughout the evolution. We apply it to a variety of quantum circuits and demonstrate significant speedups over state-of-art quantum trajectory methods and convergence to exact solutions even in non-Markovian regimes where trajectory methods fail. Our approach improves the efficiency of classical simulation of gate-based quantum computing, quantum annealing, and general open system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the present work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding BBGKY hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the ZNE method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE we obtain an average reduction of the error by $(18.2 \pm 0.5)\%$ and $(52.8 \pm 6.3)\%$ for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics simulation via Hamilton simulation algorithms is one of the most crucial applications in the quantum computing field. While this task has been relatively considered the target in the fault-tolerance era, the experiment for demonstrating utility by an IBM team simulates the dynamics of an Ising-type quantum system with the Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation algorithm with the help of quantum error mitigation. In this study, we propose the data-efficient 1D extrapolation method to mitigate not only physical errors but also algorithmic errors of Trotterized quantum circuits in both the near-term and early fault-tolerant eras. Our proposed extrapolation method uses expectation values obtained by Trotterized circuits, where the Trotter number is selected to minimize both physical and algorithmic errors according to the circuit's physical error rate. We also propose a method that combines the data-efficient 1D extrapolation with purification QEM methods, which improves accuracy more at the expense of multiple copies of quantum states or the depth of the quantum circuit. Using the 1D transverse-field Ising model, we numerically demonstrate our proposed methods and confirm that our proposed extrapolation method suppresses both statistical and systematic errors more than the previous extrapolation method.</description>

Abstract: We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA approach outperforms the cumulant expansion method in certain models and performs comparably well in others, all while offering significantly lower computational costs and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</description>

      <title>A decision-theoretic approach to dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a decision-theoretic framework for dealing with uncertainty in quantum mechanics. This uncertainty is two-fold: on the one hand there may be uncertainty about the state the quantum system is in, and on the other hand, as is essential to quantum mechanical uncertainty, even if the quantum state is known, measurements may still produce an uncertain outcome. In our framework, measurements therefore play the role of acts with an uncertain outcome and our simple decision-theoretic postulates ensure that Born's rule is encapsulated in the utility functions associated with such acts. This approach allows us to uncouple (precise) probability theory from quantum mechanics, in the sense that it leaves room for a more general, so-called imprecise probabilities approach. We discuss the mathematical implications of our findings, which allow us to give a decision-theoretic foundation to recent seminal work by Benavoli, Facchini and Zaffalon, and we compare our approach to earlier and different approaches by Deutsch and Wallace.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the resolution of polysemy through dynamic, context-aware vector embeddings, contrasting this with a quantum-inspired framework for semantic context. We then investigate the intentional role of stochasticity in the generative process, identifying it as the core mechanism for creative and varied outputs. Finally, we explore the compelling analogy between the model's reliance on vector-space projections and the formalisms of quantum mechanics. These principles are presented within the complete training context - from pre-training to reinforcement learning - to provide a cohesive understanding of both the construction and the intrinsic behavior of these models.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Orders for Entanglement Swapping in Path Graphs: A Greedy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density matrix yields probabilistic information about the outcome of measurements on a quantum system, but it does not distinguish between classical randomness in the preparation of the system and entanglement with its environment. Here, we show that retrodiction, employing both prior and posterior knowledge, gives rise to conditional probabilities for measurements on a single system, that can witness if it is part of a larger composite system. The degree of certainty with which one can retrodict the outcomes of multiple measurements on a system can witness both the existence and the quantitative nature of its entanglement with the environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Vehicle Routing: Realizing QAOA-based Approach on Gate-Based Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge with broad applications in logistics and transportation. In this work, we present a quantum-assisted framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a link-based formulation of VRP. Our approach encodes flow conservation and subtour elimination directly into the cost Hamiltonian, preserving graph structure while avoiding ancillary qubits. We design and implement the full pipeline on a gate-based quantum computer, including problem encoding, circuit synthesis, and execution on IBM Quantum System One. Experimental results on small VRP instances highlight the effects of penalty scaling, coefficient normalization, and circuit depth on solution feasibility under hardware noise. While scalability remains constrained by circuit complexity and decoherence, the study demonstrates a practical pathway for implementing VRP on quantum hardware and identifies methodological directions for advancing near-term quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Circuit structure-preserving error mitigation for High-Fidelity Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing methods to accurately characterize and mitigate the impact of noise is crucial for enhancing the fidelity of quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a circuit structure-preserving error mitigation framework for parameterized quantum circuits. A key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to retain the original circuit architecture while effectively characterizing and mitigating gate errors, enabling robust and high-fidelity simulations. This makes it particularly well suited for small-scale circuits that require repeated execution at large sampling rates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform variational quantum simulations of a non-Hermitian ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising chain on IBM Quantum processors. The mitigated result shows excellent agreement with exact theoretical predictions across a range of noise levels. Our strategy offers a practical solution for addressing gate-induced errors and significantly broadens the scope of feasible quantum simulations on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Bridging the classical and quantum regimes in a dissipative Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of a dissipative Ising chain with varying quantum correlation. Invoking an ensemble-average formalism, and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide a qualitatively correct description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Pulse Efficiency Constraints in Atom Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently planned and constructed terrestrial detectors for gravitational waves and dark matter based on differential light-pulse atom interferometry are designed around three primary strategies to enhance their sensitivity: (i) Resonant-mode enhancement using multiple diamonds, (ii) large-momentum-transfer techniques to increase arm separation within the interferometer, and (iii) very-long baseline schemes that increase the distance between the two interferometers. Both resonant-mode enhancement and large-momentum-transfer techniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse fidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time, increasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller atomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between interferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, large-momentum-transfer pulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be carefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for multi-diamond geometries, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a single interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline dimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. We provide practical analytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be applied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers that demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum transfer techniques. As a result, the observed sensitivity falls short of expectations - an effect caused by both arm separation and atom loss per pulse - highlighting the urgent need for research aimed at improving pulse fidelities.</description>

Abstract: Despite their Nobel Prize-winning empirical falsification, the interpretation of the Bell inequality remains a subject of controversy. This article discusses and attempts to clarify the reasons John S. Bell and A. Einstein claimed that quantum entanglement implies puzzling nonlocal correlations that Einstein famously termed ``spooky action at a distance.'' The issue remains highly controversial and has roughly divided the scientific community into localists and nonlocalists. Without taking a stance for either side in the long-standing, polarized debate, we examine Bell's actual argument, highlighting the differences between his approach and the current orthodoxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistics of local measurements of joint quantum systems can sometimes be used to distinguish the spatiotemporal structure in which they were measured. We first prove that every bipartite separable density matrix is temporally compatible with direct causal influence for arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum systems and measurements of a tomographically-complete class of observables, which includes all Pauli observables in the case of multi-qubit systems. Equivalently, if a bipartite density matrix is not temporally compatible with direct causal influence, then it must be entangled. We also provide an operational meaning for the temporal evolution consistent with such correlations in terms of a generalized dephasing channel and a pretty good measurement. The two temporal evolutions are Bayesian inverses of each other, which is different from them being Petz recovery maps of each other. Finally, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary bipartite quantum state to be temporally compatible, thereby providing a temporal analogue of the positive partial transpose criterion valid for quantum systems of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Quasi-degenerate resonant eigenstate doublets of two quantum emitters in a closed waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of systems of quantum emitters in waveguide quantum electrodynamics is significantly influenced by the relation between their spatial separation and the wavelength of the emitted photons. If the distance that separates a pair of emitters meets specific resonance conditions, the photon amplitudes produced from decay may destructively interfere. In an infinite-waveguide setting, this effect gives rise to bound states in the continuum, where a photon remains confined between the emitters. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with periodic boundary conditions, there exist two such relevant distances for a given arrangement of the quantum emitters, leading to states in which a photon is confined to either the shorter or the longer path that connects the emitters. If the ratio of the shorter and the longer path is a rational number, these two kinds of resonant eigenstates are allowed to co-exist for the same Hamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the existence of quasi-degenerate resonant doublets of a pair of identical emitters coupled to a linear waveguide mode. The states that form the doublet are searched among the ones in which a single excitation tends to remain bound to the emitters. We investigate the spectrum in a finite range around degeneracy points to check whether the doublet remains well separated from the closest eigenvalues in the spectrum. The identification of quasi-degenerate doublets opens the possibility to manipulate the emitters-waveguide system as an effectively two-level system in specific energy ranges, providing an innovative tool for quantum technology tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</description>

      <title>Beyond Copenhagen: Following the Trail of Decoherence in Feynman's Light Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman's light microscope invites us to reconsider what we thought we knew about quantum reality. Rather than invoking wavefunction collapse to predict the loss of fringes in a monitored interferometer, Feynman analyzes the problem in terms of a disturbance. This approach raises the question of whether the classical world, including its localized particles and definite measurement outcomes, might emerge as the universe evolves smoothly according to Schr\"odinger's equation. Treating the particle and its environment as an entangled system, unmodified quantum mechanics shows remarkable success toward this end. This is the purview of decoherence theory. The question of wavefunction collapse then becomes one of what we want from the theory. Do we expect it to describe microscopic reality, or do we consider it to be only a tool for predicting measurement outcomes? Both options are uncomfortable. The first, when applied to unmodified quantum mechanics, implies that each moment in time branches into a vast number of divergent macroscopic realities. The second represents, for many practitioners, a weakened view of science. This article is written to be accessible to anyone with an undergraduate course in quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Linear regression is fundamental to statistical analysis and machine learning, but its application to large-scale datasets necessitates distributed computing. The problem also arises in quantum computing, where handling extensive data requires distributed approaches. This paper investigates distributed linear regression in the quantum coordinator model. Building upon the distributed quantum least squares protocol developed by Montanaro and Shao, we propose improved and extended quantum protocols for solving both ordinary (unregularized) and L2-regularized (Tikhonov) least squares problems. For ordinary least squares methods, our protocol reduces the quantum communication complexity compared to the previous protocol. In particular, this yields a quadratic improvement in the number of digits of precision required for the generated quantum states. This improvement is achieved by incorporating advanced techniques such as branch marking and branch-marked gapped phase estimation developed by Low and Su. Additionally, we introduce a quantum protocol for the L2-regularized least squares problem and derive its quantum communication complexity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR)-a fundamental trade-off between dynamical activity and current fluctuations-in two configurations of a maser heat engine. We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics. While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Compact Wavefunctions from Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent direction in quantum computing for molecular electronic structure sees the use of quantum devices as configuration sampling machines integrated within high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. This appeals to the strengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is classically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in the selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final molecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is therefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an algorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference perturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration subspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising 42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy curve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis set, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. We assess the resulting wavefunctions for compactness, a point on which QSCI has previously been criticised. At large separations, where static correlation dominates, we find a configuration space more than 200 times smaller than that obtained from a conventional SCI selection criterion yields comparable energies. We also compare against the best-in-class Heatbath Configuration Interaction algorithm and observe similar wavefunction compactness at convergence. This result is achieved with a configuration sampling scheme that uses the experimental orbital occupancies of a time-evolved quantum state to predict likely single and double excitations away from existing configurations to bias the subspace expansion procedure.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states, enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares classical shadows with "quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight $w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Axion Signal Extraction in Semiconductor Spin Qubits Via Spectral Engineering</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</description>

      <title>Simulation of one and two qubit superconducting quantum gates under the non-Markovian $1/f$ noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects, Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$ noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.</description>

Abstract: Optimizing the performance of cryogenic quantum amplifiers is a key step toward achieving high-fidelity and scalable qubit readout. In this work, we present efficient and accurate modeling of a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on electromagnetic (EM) and circuit co-simulation. In contrast to conventional simulation methods where an equivalent lumped-element circuit model of the JTWPA is required, we directly perform full EM analysis of the device to faithfully determine the linear response. The extracted S-parameters are then fed into a nonlinear harmonic balance simulator with Josephson junctions represented as circuit elements. The simulated linear and gain properties are compared with experimental results and show good agreement.</description>

Abstract: Kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers (KIPAs) have been widely studied for small-signal detection in superconducting quantum circuits. In this work, we demonstrate the modeling of a niobium nitride nanowire based KIPA using electromagnetic (EM) and circuit co-simulation, and compare the outcomes with experimental results. EM analysis is first performed on the device layout, taking into account the linear part of the kinetic inductance. The results are then integrated into a harmonic balance circuit simulator, in which the current-dependent inductance is modeled by representing the nanowire as a nonlinear inductor. Both linear and nonlinear responses of the device, including temperature-dependent resonance spectra and parametric gain, are extracted and show good agreement with experiments. We further show that when the KIPA operates as a degenerate amplifier, its phase-sensitive behavior can be accurately reproduced by the simulation. Our technique can serve as a valuable enabler for the simulation and design of quantum parametric amplifiers and superconducting kinetic inductance devices.</description>

      <title>Holographic Non-Hermitian Lattices and Junctions and their RG Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogeneous non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. By tuning a complex external gauge field, we find a non-Hermitian model which can be mapped to a Hermitian one via a complexified U(1) gauge transformation. On the other hand, in the absence of the gauge field we find non-Hermitian solutions with a purely imaginary current. Despite this, all expectation values respect PT symmetry and thus we expect the system to feature unitary time evolution. Nonetheless, we have not found a map bringing these solutions to a Hermitian description. We study the RG flows of solutions with imaginary current finding that in the IR they can be mapped to a Hermitian conformal fixed point via a complexified U(1) transformation. Remarkably, we also obtain solutions where the null energy condition is violated near the boundary of the dual geometry.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. Using a symmetric superposition of the antipodal triplet states, we construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. These states exhibit non-thermal correlations, hence, are genuine quantum many-body scars. By tuning the distribution of triplets we induce extensive, logarithmic, or area-law entanglement, and can observe a second-order entanglement phase transition. Quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and quantum state constructions.</description>

      <title>Making the quantum world accessible to young learners through Quantum Picturalism: An experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The educational value of a fully diagrammatic approach in a scientific field has never been explored. We present Quantum Picturalism (QPic), an entirely diagrammatic formalism for all of qubit quantum mechanics. This framework is particularly advantageous for young learners as a novel way to teach key concepts such as entanglement, measurement, and mixed-state quantum mechanics in a math-intensive subject. This eliminates traditional obstacles without compromising mathematical correctness - removing the need for matrices, vectors, tensors, complex numbers, and trigonometry as prerequisites to learning. Its significance lies in that a field as complex as Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST), for which educational opportunities are typically exclusive to the university level and higher, can be introduced at high school level. In this study, we tested this hypothesis, examining whether QPic reduces cognitive load by lowering complex mathematical barriers while enhancing mental computation and conceptual understanding. The data was collected from an experiment conducted in 2023, whereby 54 high school students (aged 16-18) underwent 16 hours of training spread over eight weeks. The post-assessments illustrated promising outcomes in all three specific areas of focus: (1) whether QPic can alleviate technical barriers in learning QIST, (2) ensures that the content and teaching method are age appropriate, (3) increases confidence and motivation in science and STEM fields. There was a notable success rate in terms of teaching outcomes, with 82% of participants successfully passing an end-of-training exam and 48% achieving a distinction, indicating a high level of performance. The unique testing and training regime effectively reduced the technical barriers typically associated with traditional approaches, as hypothesized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.</description>

      <title>Observation of average topological phase in disordered Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06286</link>

Abstract: Topological phases have been extensively studied over the past two decades, primarily in quantum pure states, where they are protected by exact symmetries. Recently, numerous studies have theoretically demonstrated the existence of average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed quantum states, which naturally arise in real systems due to decoherence or disorder. Despite extensive experimental observations of exact SPT phases in various systems, ranging from solid-state materials to synthetic matters, average SPT phases are yet to be observed until this work. Here we report direct observations of disorder-induced many-body interacting average SPT phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, resulting in fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The induced topological phase is vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice without disorder. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric processes of quantum normal-superconductor interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting interfaces have recently been demonstrated to contain a rich variety of effects that give rise to sizable thermoelectric responses and unexpected thermal properties, despite traditionally being considered poor thermoelectrics due to their intrinsic electron-hole symmetry. We review different mechanisms driving this response in hybrid normal-superconducting junctions, depending on the dimensionality of the mesoscopic interface. In addition to discussing heat to power conversion, cooling and heat transport, special emphasis is put on physical properties of hybrid devices that can be revealed by the thermoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of an extension of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.</description>

      <title>Bosonization in $R$-paraparticle Luttinger models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of $R$-parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.</description>
