      <title>Boomerang effect in classical stochastic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Anderson localization, occurring in a disordered medium, significantly influences the dynamics of quantum particles. A fascinating manifestation of this is the "quantum boomerang effect" (QBE), observed when a quantum particle, propelled with a finite initial velocity, reverses its average trajectory, eventually halting at its starting point. This effect has recently been demonstrated in an experiment replicating the quantum kicked-rotor model. This research delves into the classical analog of QBE. We uncover evidence of a similar effect in classical systems, characterized by the absence of typical diffusion processes. Our investigation encompasses both simplified probabilistic models and more complex phenomenological models that link classical with quantum mechanics. The results indicate that the boomerang effect is not confined to the quantum realm and may also be present in diverse systems exhibiting subdiffusive behavior.</description>

      <title>K-core attack, equilibrium K-core, and kinetically constrained spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin systems are toy models of supercooled liquids and amorphous solids. In this Perspective, we revisit the prototypical Fredrickson-Andersen (FA) kinetically constrained model from the viewpoint of K-core combinatorial optimization. Each kinetic cluster of the FA system, containing all the mutually visitable microscopic occupation configurations, is exactly the solution space of a specific instance of the K-core attack problem. The whole set of different jammed occupation patterns of the FA system is the configuration space of an equilibrium K-core problem. Based on recent theoretical results achieved on the K-core attack and equilibrium K-core problems, we discuss the thermodynamic spin glass phase transitions and the maximum occupation density of the fully unfrozen FA kinetic cluster, and the minimum occupation density and extreme vulnerability of the partially frozen (jammed) kinetic clusters. The equivalence between K-core attack and the fully unfrozen FA kinetic cluster also implies a new way of sampling K-core attack solutions.</description>

      <title>Fidelity and criticality in the nonreciprocal Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical behaviors of the ground and first excited states in the one-dimensional nonreciprocal Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper model using both the self-normal and biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities. We demonstrate that fidelity susceptibilities serve as a probe for the phase transition in the nonreciprocal AAH model. For ground states, characterized by real eigenenergies across the entire regime, both fidelity susceptibilities near the critical points scale as $N^{2}$, akin to the Hermitian AAH model. However, for the first-excited states, where $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions occur, the fidelity susceptibilities exhibit distinct scaling laws, contingent upon whether the lattice consists of even or odd sites. For even lattices, the self-normal fidelity susceptibilities near the critical points continue to scale as $N^{2}$. For odd lattices, the biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities diverge, while the self-normal fidelity susceptibilities exhibit linear behavior, indicating a novel scaling law.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Stochastic Quantum Control: $d$-adic R\'enyi Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum information in many-body systems with large onsite Hilbert space dimension admits an enlightening description in terms of effective statistical mechanics models. Motivated by this fact, we reveal a connection between three separate models: the classically chaotic $d$-adic R\'{e}nyi map with stochastic control, a quantum analog of this map for qudits, and a Potts model on a random graph. The classical model and its quantum analog share a transition between chaotic and controlled phases, driven by a randomly applied control map that attempts to order the system. In the quantum model, the control map necessitates measurements that concurrently drive a phase transition in the entanglement content of the late-time steady state. To explore the interplay of the control and entanglement transitions, we derive an effective Potts model from the quantum model and use it to probe information-theoretic quantities that witness both transitions. The entanglement transition is found to be in the bond-percolation universality class, consistent with other measurement-induced phase transitions, while the control transition is governed by a classical random walk. These two phase transitions merge as a function of model parameters, consistent with behavior observed in previous small-size numerical studies of the quantum model.</description>

      <title>Long-range multipartite entanglement near measurement-induced transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create new states of matter out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. The 2- and 4-party cases are also covered with examples. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04473</link>

Abstract: Unraveling the relation between structural information and the dynamic properties of supercooled liquids is one of the grand challenges of physics. Dynamic heterogeneity, characterized by the propensity of particles, is often used as a proxy for the dynamic slowing down. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach based on a time-lagged autoencoder (TAE) to elucidate the effect of structural features on the long-time dynamic heterogeneity of supercooled liquids. The TAE uses an autoencoder to reconstruct features at time $t + \Delta t$ from input features at time $t$ for individual particles, and the resulting latent space variables are considered as order parameters. In the Kob-Andersen system, with a $\Delta t$ about a thousand times smaller than the relaxation time, the TAE order parameter exhibits a remarkable correlation with the long-time propensity. We find that radial features on all length-scales are required to capture the long-time dynamics, consistent with recent simulations. This shows that fluctuations of structural features contain sufficient information about the long-time dynamic heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>A replica analysis of under-bagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under-bagging (UB), which combines under sampling and bagging, is a popular ensemble learning method for training classifiers on an imbalanced data. Using bagging to reduce the increased variance caused by the reduction in sample size due to under sampling is a natural approach. However, it has recently been pointed out that in generalized linear models, naive bagging, which does not consider the class imbalance structure, and ridge regularization can produce the same results. Therefore, it is not obvious whether it is better to use UB, which requires an increased computational cost proportional to the number of under-sampled data sets, when training linear models. Given such a situation, in this study, we heuristically derive a sharp asymptotics of UB and use it to compare with several other standard methods for learning from imbalanced data, in the scenario where a linear classifier is trained from a two-component mixture data. The methods compared include the under-sampling (US) method, which trains a model using a single realization of the subsampled data, and the simple weighting (SW) method, which trains a model with a weighted loss on the entire data. It is shown that the performance of UB is improved by increasing the size of the majority class while keeping the size of the minority fixed, even though the class imbalance can be large, especially when the size of the minority class is small. This is in contrast to US, whose performance does not change as the size of the majority class increases, and SW, whose performance decreases as the imbalance increases. These results are different from the case of the naive bagging when training generalized linear models without considering the structure of the class imbalance, indicating the intrinsic difference between the ensembling and the direct regularization on the parameters.</description>
