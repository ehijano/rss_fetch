      <title>Enhanced Battery Capacity Estimation in Data-Limited Scenarios through Swarm Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased, feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are available.</description>

      <title>Robust Visual Servoing under Human Supervision for Assembly Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework enabling mobile manipulators to reliably complete pick-and-place tasks for assembling structures from construction blocks. The picking uses an eye-in-hand visual servoing controller for object tracking with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure fiducial markers in the blocks remain visible. An additional robot with an eye-to-hand setup ensures precise placement, critical for structural stability. We integrate human-in-the-loop capabilities for flexibility and fault correction and analyze robustness to camera pose errors, proposing adapted barrier functions to handle them. Lastly, experiments validate the framework on 6-DoF mobile arms.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Utility-Scale Solar Siting for Local Economic Benefits and Regional Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Midwest, with its vast agricultural lands, is rapidly emerging as a key region for utility-scale solar expansion. However, traditional power planning has yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to guide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to emphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting productive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by endogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning model to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for the cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great Lakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that are embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at minimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our findings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland productivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of installed solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to $34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller counties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced agricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland quality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher economic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by 2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by 39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5% in system-wide costs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating economic considerations into utility-scale solar planning to better align decarbonization goals with regional and local economic development.</description>

      <title>Spike-Kal: A Spiking Neuron Network Assisted Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kalman filtering can provide an optimal estimation of the system state from noisy observation data. This algorithm's performance depends on the accuracy of system modeling and noise statistical characteristics, which are usually challenging to obtain in practical applications. The powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep learning, combined with its ability to extract features from large amounts of data automatically, offer new opportunities for improving the Kalman filter. This paper proposes a novel method that leverages the Spiking Neural Network to optimize the Kalman filter. Our approach aims to reduce the reliance on prior knowledge of system and observation noises, allowing for adaptation to varying statistical characteristics of time-varying noise. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of SNNs in improving the computational efficiency of the Kalman filter. In our method, we design an integration strategy between the SNN and the Kalman filter. The SNN is trained to directly approximate the optimal gain matrix from observation data, thereby alleviating the computational burden of complex matrix operations inherent in traditional Kalman filtering while maintaining the accuracy and robustness of state estimation. Its average error has been reduced by 18\%-65\% compared with other methods.</description>

      <title>Incorporating a Deep Neural Network into Moving Horizon Estimation for Embedded Thermal Torque Derating of an Electric Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel state estimation framework that incorporates Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE), shifting from traditional physics-based models to rapidly developed data-driven techniques. A DNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) nodes is trained on synthetic data generated by a high-fidelity thermal model of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM), which undergoes thermal derating as part of the torque control strategy in a battery electric vehicle. The MHE is constructed by integrating the trained DNN with a simplified driving dynamics model in a discrete-time formulation, incorporating the LSTM hidden and cell states in the state vector to retain system dynamics. The resulting optimal control problem (OCP) is formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) and implemented using the acados framework. Model-in-the-loop (MiL) simulations demonstrate accurate temperature estimation, even under noisy sensor conditions or failures. Achieving threefold real-time capability on embedded hardware confirms the feasibility of the approach for practical deployment. The primary focus of this study is to assess the feasibility of the MHE framework using a DNN-based plant model instead of focusing on quantitative comparisons of vehicle performance. Overall, this research highlights the potential of DNN-based MHE for real-time, safety-critical applications by combining the strengths of model-based and data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Market-Driven Flexibility Provision: A Tri-Level Optimization Approach for Carbon Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources (RES) in the power grid can reduce carbon intensity, but also presents certain challenges. The uncertainty and intermittent nature of RES emphasize the need for flexibility in power systems. Moreover, there are noticeable mismatches between real-time electricity prices and carbon intensity patterns throughout the day. These discrepancies may lead customers to schedule energy-intensive tasks during the early hours of the day, a period characterized by lower electricity prices but higher carbon intensity. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive framework aimed at encouraging customer participation in electricity markets and aligning their flexibility with carbon intensity trends. The proposed approach integrates an incentive-based tariff with a tri-level optimization model, where customers are motivated to submit flexibility bids and, in return, receive financial rewards based on their contributions. The tri-level model ensures a dynamic interaction between the market operation platform (MOP) and end-users. Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE-33 bus system, supported by two scenarios with different RES generations and customer behaviors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in guiding the customers' consumption behaviors towards low carbon intensity.</description>

      <title>Safe Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Dynamics and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial paper focuses on safe physics-informed machine learning in the context of dynamics and control, providing a comprehensive overview of how to integrate physical models and safety guarantees. As machine learning techniques enhance the modeling and control of complex dynamical systems, ensuring safety and stability remains a critical challenge, especially in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, medical decision-making, and energy systems. We explore various approaches for embedding and ensuring safety constraints, such as structural priors, Lyapunov functions, Control Barrier Functions, predictive control, projections, and robust optimization techniques, ensuring that the learned models respect stability and safety criteria. Additionally, we delve into methods for uncertainty quantification and safety verification, including reachability analysis and neural network verification tools, which help validate that control policies remain within safe operating bounds even in uncertain environments. The paper includes illustrative examples demonstrating the implementation aspects of safe learning frameworks that combine the strengths of data-driven approaches with the rigor of physical principles, offering a path toward the safe control of complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new task-space Non-singular Terminal Super-Twisting Sliding Mode (NT-STSM) controller with adaptive gains for robust trajectory tracking of a 7-DOF robotic manipulator. The proposed approach addresses the challenges of chattering, unknown disturbances, and rotational motion tracking, making it suited for high-DOF manipulators in dexterous manipulation tasks. A rigorous boundedness proof is provided, offering gain selection guidelines for practical implementation. Simulations and hardware experiments with external disturbances demonstrate the proposed controller's robust, accurate tracking with reduced control effort under unknown disturbances compared to other NT-STSM and conventional controllers. The results demonstrated that the proposed NT-STSM controller mitigates chattering and instability in complex motions, making it a viable solution for dexterous robotic manipulations and various industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Delay Compensation for Enhanced Control of Assistive Soft Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots are increasingly used in healthcare, especially for assistive care, due to their inherent safety and adaptability. Controlling soft robots is challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics and the presence of time delays, especially in applications like a soft robotic arm for patient care. This paper presents a learning-based approach to approximate the nonlinear state predictor (Smith Predictor), aiming to improve tracking performance in a two-module soft robot arm with a short inherent input delay. The method uses Kernel Recursive Least Squares Tracker (KRLST) for online learning of the system dynamics and a Legendre Delay Network (LDN) to compress past input history for efficient delay compensation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in tracking performance compared to a baseline model-based non-linear controller. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of the improvements. The method is computationally efficient and adaptable online, making it suitable for real-world scenarios and highlighting its potential for enabling safer and more accurate control of soft robots in assistive care applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Transferable Friction Models and LuGre Identification via Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially, we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks, offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap in robotics and control.</description>

      <title>Practical Insights on Grasp Strategies for Mobile Manipulation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile manipulation robots are continuously advancing, with their grasping capabilities rapidly progressing. However, there are still significant gaps preventing state-of-the-art mobile manipulators from widespread real-world deployments, including their ability to reliably grasp items in unstructured environments. To help bridge this gap, we developed SHOPPER, a mobile manipulation robot platform designed to push the boundaries of reliable and generalizable grasp strategies. We develop these grasp strategies and deploy them in a real-world grocery store -- an exceptionally challenging setting chosen for its vast diversity of manipulable items, fixtures, and layouts. In this work, we present our detailed approach to designing general grasp strategies towards picking any item in a real grocery store. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of our latest real-world field test, discussing key findings related to fundamental failure modes over hundreds of distinct pick attempts. Through our detailed analysis, we aim to offer valuable practical insights and identify key grasping challenges, which can guide the robotics community towards pressing open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Parking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and dynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when compared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking situations.</description>

      <title>Biasing the Driving Style of an Artificial Race Driver for Online Time-Optimal Maneuver Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to bias the driving style of an artificial race driver (ARD) for online time-optimal trajectory planning. Our method leverages a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that combines time minimization with exit speed maximization at the end of the planning horizon. We introduce a new MPC terminal cost formulation based on the trajectory planned in the previous MPC step, enabling ARD to adapt its driving style from early to late apex maneuvers in real-time. Our approach is computationally efficient, allowing for low replan times and long planning horizons. We validate our method through simulations, comparing the results against offline minimum-lap-time (MLT) optimal control and online minimum-time MPC solutions. The results demonstrate that our new terminal cost enables ARD to bias its driving style, and achieve online lap times close to the MLT solution and faster than the minimum-time MPC solution. Our approach paves the way for a better understanding of the reasons behind human drivers' choice of early or late apex maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Integral control of the proximal gradient method for unbiased sparse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximal gradient methods are popular in sparse optimization as they are straightforward to implement. Nevertheless, they achieve biased solutions, requiring many iterations to converge. This work addresses these issues through a suitable feedback control of the algorithm's hyperparameter. Specifically, by designing an integral control that does not substantially impact the computational complexity, we can reach an unbiased solution in a reasonable number of iterations. In the paper, we develop and analyze the convergence of the proposed approach for strongly-convex problems. Moreover, numerical simulations validate and extend the theoretical results to the non-strongly convex framework.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Beamfocusing in Near-Field IoT Communication Systems: A Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massive number of antennas in extremely large aperture array (ELAA) systems shifts the propagation regime of signals in internet of things (IoT) communication systems towards near-field spherical wave propagation. We propose a reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted beamfocusing mechanism, where the design of the two-dimensional beam codebook that contains both the angular and distance domains is challenging. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Transformer-based two-stage beam training algorithm, which includes the coarse and fine search phases. The proposed mechanism provides a fine-grained codebook with enhanced spatial resolution, enabling precise beamfocusing. Specifically, in the first stage, the beam training is performed to estimate the approximate location of the device by using a simple codebook, determining whether it is within the beamfocusing range (BFR) or the none-beamfocusing range (NBFR). In the second stage, by using a more precise codebook, a fine-grained beam search strategy is conducted. Experimental results unveil that the precision of the RIS-assisted beamfocusing is greatly improved. The proposed method achieves beam selection accuracy up to 97% at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB, and improves 10% to 50% over the baseline method at different SNRs.</description>

      <title>Imperative MPC: An End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning with Differentiable MPC for UAV Attitude Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics are critical in robotics, especially in scenarios with unpredictable external influences and complex dynamics. Traditional cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal performance due to conservative assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure data-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample efficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid methods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an end-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a self-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry (IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and predicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in a bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control actions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and predicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based perception with the interpretable model-based control. Results show the effectiveness even under strong wind. It can simultaneously enhance both the MPC parameter learning and IMU prediction performance.</description>

      <title>A New Semidefinite Relaxation for Linear and Piecewise-Affine Optimal Control with Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a semidefinite relaxation for optimal control of linear systems with time scaling. These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints, but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the computational load light. We further extend our method to handle piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS, different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single semidefinite program.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic navigation offers wireless control over magnetic objects, which has important medical applications, such as targeted drug delivery and minimally invasive surgery. Magnetic navigation systems are categorized into systems using permanent magnets and systems based on electromagnets. Electromagnetic Navigation Systems (eMNSs) are believed to have a superior actuation bandwidth, facilitating trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. This greatly expands the range of potential medical applications and includes even dynamic environments as encountered in cardiovascular interventions. To showcase the dynamic capabilities of eMNSs, we successfully stabilize a (non-magnetic) inverted pendulum on the tip of a magnetically driven arm. Our approach employs a model-based framework that leverages Lagrangian mechanics to capture the interaction between the mechanical dynamics and the magnetic field. Using system identification, we estimate unknown parameters, the actuation bandwidth, and characterize the system's nonlinearity. To explore the limits of electromagnetic navigation and evaluate its scalability, we characterize the electrical system dynamics and perform reference measurements on a clinical-scale eMNS, affirming that the proposed dynamic control methodologies effectively translate to larger coil configurations. A state-feedback controller stabilizes the inherently unstable pendulum, and an iterative learning control scheme enables accurate tracking of non-equilibrium trajectories. Furthermore, to understand structural limitations of our control strategy, we analyze the influence of magnetic field gradients on the motion of the system. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration to stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum through electromagnetic navigation.</description>

      <title>Robust Data-Driven Tube-Based Zonotopic Predictive Control with Closed-Loop Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a robust data-driven tube-based zonotopic predictive control (TZPC) approach for discrete-time linear systems, designed to ensure stability and recursive feasibility in the presence of bounded noise. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In an initial learning phase, we provide an over-approximation of all models consistent with past input and noisy state data using zonotope properties. Subsequently, in a control phase, we formulate an optimization problem, which by integrating terminal ingredients is proven to be recursively feasible. Moreover, we prove that implementing this data-driven predictive control approach guarantees robust exponential stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness and competitive performance of the proposed control strategy, compared to recent data-driven predictive control methods, are illustrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Effect of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels on low-voltage feeders: Evidence from smart meter profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and solar panels are low-carbon technologies (LCTs) that are being connected to the low-voltage grid (LVG) at a rapid pace. One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the distribution system operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modelled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Publishing Accurate Imbalance Prices Using Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing reliance on renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has introduced challenges due to their uncontrollable production. This complicates maintaining the electrical grid balance, prompting some transmission system operators in Western Europe to implement imbalance tariffs that penalize unsustainable power deviations. These tariffs create an implicit demand response framework to mitigate grid instability. Yet, several challenges limit active participation. In Belgium, for example, imbalance prices are only calculated at the end of each 15-minute settlement period, creating high risk due to price uncertainty. This risk is further amplified by the inherent volatility of imbalance prices, discouraging participation. Although transmission system operators provide minute-based price predictions, the system imbalance volatility makes accurate price predictions challenging to obtain and requires sophisticated techniques. Moreover, publishing price estimates can prompt participants to adjust their schedules, potentially affecting the system balance and the final price, adding further complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search method that publishes accurate imbalance prices while accounting for potential response actions. Our approach models the system dynamics using a neural network forecaster and a cluster of virtual batteries controlled by reinforcement learning agents. Compared to Belgium's current publication method, our technique improves price accuracy by 20.4% under ideal conditions and by 12.8% in more realistic scenarios. This research addresses an unexplored, yet crucial problem, positioning this paper as a pioneering work in analyzing the potential of more advanced imbalance price publishing techniques.</description>

      <title>Balancing Passenger Transport and Power Distribution: A Distributed Dispatch Policy for Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared autonomous electric vehicles can provide on-demand transportation for passengers while also interacting extensively with the electric distribution system. This interaction is especially beneficial after a disaster when the large battery capacity of the fleet can be used to restore critical electric loads. We develop a dispatch policy that balances the need to continue serving passengers (especially critical workers) and the ability to transfer energy across the network. The model predictive control policy tracks both passenger and energy flows and provides maximum passenger throughput if any policy can. The resulting mixed integer linear programming problem is difficult to solve for large-scale problems, so a distributed solution approach is developed to improve scalability, privacy, and resilience. We demonstrate that the proposed heuristic, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, is effective in achieving near-optimal solutions quickly. The dispatch policy is examined in simulation to demonstrate the ability of vehicles to balance these competing objectives with benefits to both systems. Finally, we compare several dispatch behaviors, demonstrating the importance of including operational constraints and objectives from both the transportation and electric systems in the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing carbon capture technology on-board ships holds promise as a solution to facilitate the reduction of carbon intensity in international shipping, as mandated by the International Maritime Organization. In this work, we address the energy-efficient operation of shipboard carbon capture processes by proposing a hybrid modeling-based economic predictive control scheme. Specifically, we consider a comprehensive shipboard carbon capture process that encompasses the ship engine system and the shipboard post-combustion carbon capture plant. To accurately and robustly characterize the dynamic behaviors of this shipboard plant, we develop a hybrid dynamic process model that integrates available imperfect physical knowledge with neural networks trained using process operation data. An economic model predictive control approach is proposed based on the hybrid model to ensure carbon capture efficiency while minimizing energy consumption required for the carbon capture process operation. The cross-entropy method is employed to efficiently solve the complex non-convex optimization problem associated with the proposed hybrid model-based economic model predictive control method. Extensive simulations, analyses, and comparisons are conducted to verify the effectiveness and illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Principles and Framework for the Operationalisation of Meaningful Human Control over Autonomous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an alignment for the operationalisation of Meaningful Human Control (MHC) for autonomous systems by proposing operational principles for MHC and introducing a generic framework for its application. With a plethora of different seemingly diverging expansions for use of MHC in practice, this work aims to bring alignment and convergence use in practice. The increasing integration of autonomous systems in various domains emphasises a critical need to maintain human control to ensure responsible safety, accountability, and ethical operation of these systems. The concept of MHC offers an ideal concept for the design and evaluation of human control over autonomous systems, while considering human and technology capabilities. Through analysis of existing literature and investigation across various domains and related concepts, principles for the operationalisation of MHC are set out to provide tangible guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to implement MHC in their systems. The proposed framework dissects generic components of systems and their subsystems aligned with different agents, stakeholders and processes at different levels of proximity to an autonomous technology. The framework is domain-agnostic, emphasizing the universal applicability of the MHC principles irrespective of the technological context, paving the way for safer and more responsible autonomous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) represents a novel antenna architecture that enhances wireless communication system performance by independently or collectively adjusting each antenna's boresight/orientation. In this demonstration, we develop a prototype of radar sensing-aided rotatable antenna that integrates radar sensing with dynamic antenna orientation to enhance wireless communication performance while maintaining low hardware costs. The proposed prototype consists of a transmitter (TX) module and a receiver (RX) module, both of which employ universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for transmitting and receiving signals. Specifically, the TX utilizes a laser radar to detect the RX's location and conveys the angle of arrival (AoA) information to its antenna servo, which enables the RA to align its boresight direction with the identified RX. Experimental results examine the effectiveness of the proposed prototype and indicate that the RA significantly outperforms the traditional fixed-antenna system in terms of increasing received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Driven Movable-Antenna-assisted Full-Duplex RSMA for Multi-User Communication: Performance and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) radios at base station (BS) have gained significant interest because of their ability to simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band. However, FD communication is hindered by self-interference (SI) and intra-cell interference caused by simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions affecting downlink (DL) reception. These interferences significantly limit the ability to fully exploit FD's potential. Recently, movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, offering an effective way to mitigate interference by adjusting the position of each MA within the transmitter or receiver region. This dynamic repositioning allows MAs to move away from high-interference zones to areas with minimal interference, thereby enhancing multiplexing gain and improving spectral efficiency (SE). In light of this, in this paper, we investigate an FD communication system by integrating it with MAs to evaluate and investigate its effectiveness in handling SI and intra-cell interference. Moreover, we utilize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) as our multiple access technique in both UL and DL transmission. To achieve the full potential of the system, we evaluated three different scenarios with FD-BS-RSMA with MAs where our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing the transmitting and receiving beamforming vectors, UL user equipment (UE) transmission power, MA positions, and common stream split ratio of RSMA while satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of all UEs, common stream constraint, power budget requirements of BS and UL UEs, and inter-MA distance. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex in nature, and hence, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach which can handle the non-convexity in a discrete manner by optimizing each variable in a different neural network.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Boresight Control of Spacecraft Under Pointing Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes an integrated boresight guidance and control (IBGC) scheme to address the boresight reorientation problem of spacecraft under temporal and pointing constraints. A $C^1$ continuous, saturated prescribed-time adjustment (PPTA) function is presented, along with the establishment of a practical prescribed-time stability criterion. Utilizing the time scale transformation technique and the PPTA function, we propose a prescribed-time guidance law that guides the boresight vector from almost any initial orientation in free space to a small neighborhood of the goal orientation within a preassigned time, while avoiding all forbidden zones augmented with safety margins. Subsequently, a prescribed-time disturbance observer (PTDO) is derived to reconstruct the external disturbances. By leveraging barrier and PPTA functions, a PTDO-based reduced-attitude tracking controller is developed, which ensures prescribed-time boresight tracking within a ``safe tube''. By judiciously setting the safety margins, settling times, and safe tube for the guidance and control laws, the proposed IBGC scheme achieves pointing-constrained boresight reorientation within a required task completion time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IBGC scheme.</description>

      <title>Perceive With Confidence: Statistical Safety Assurances for Navigation with Learning-Based Perception</title>

Abstract: Rapid advances in perception have enabled large pre-trained models to be used out of the box for transforming high-dimensional, noisy, and partial observations of the world into rich occupancy representations. However, the reliability of these models and consequently their safe integration onto robots remains unknown when deployed in environments unseen during training. To provide safety guarantees, we rigorously quantify the uncertainty of pre-trained perception systems for object detection and scene completion via a novel calibration technique based on conformal prediction. Crucially, this procedure guarantees robustness to distribution shifts in states when perception outputs are used in conjunction with a planner. As a result, the calibrated perception system can be used in combination with any safe planner to provide an end-to-end statistical assurance on safety in unseen environments. We evaluate the resulting approach, Perceive with Confidence (PwC), in simulation and on hardware where a quadruped robot navigates through previously unseen indoor, static environments. These experiments validate the safety assurances for obstacle avoidance provided by PwC. In simulation, our method reduces obstacle misdetection by $70\%$ compared to uncalibrated perception models. While misdetections lead to collisions for baseline methods, our approach consistently achieves $100\%$ safety. We further demonstrate reducing the conservatism of our method without sacrificing safety, achieving a $46\%$ increase in success rates in challenging environments while maintaining $100\%$ safety. In hardware experiments, our method improves empirical safety by $40\%$ over baselines and reduces obstacle misdetection by $93.3\%$. The safety gap widens to $46.7\%$ when navigation speed increases, highlighting our approach's robustness under more demanding conditions.</description>

      <title>What Are the Odds? Improving the foundations of Statistical Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05424</link>

Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model for decision making under uncertainty. They exhibit non-deterministic choice as well as probabilistic uncertainty. Traditionally, verification algorithms assume exact knowledge of the probabilities that govern the behaviour of an MDP. As this assumption is often unrealistic in practice, statistical model checking (SMC) was developed in the past two decades. It allows to analyse MDPs with unknown transition probabilities and provide probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the result. Model-based SMC algorithms sample the MDP and build a model of it by estimating all transition probabilities, essentially for every transition answering the question: ``What are the odds?'' However, so far the statistical methods employed by the state of the art SMC algorithms are quite naive. Our contribution are several fundamental improvements to those methods: On the one hand, we survey statistics literature for better concentration inequalities; on the other hand, we propose specialised approaches that exploit our knowledge of the MDP. Our improvements are generally applicable to many kinds of problem statements because they are largely independent of the setting. Moreover, our experimental evaluation shows that they lead to significant gains, reducing the number of samples that the SMC algorithm has to collect by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Holographic Surface-aided Distributed MIMO Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (phased-MIMO) radar systems have attracted wide attention in target detection and tracking. However, the phase-shifting circuits in phased subarrays contribute to high power consumption and hardware cost. To address this issue, an energy-efficient and cost-efficient metamaterial antenna array, i.e., reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS), has been developed. In this letter, we propose RHS-aided distributed MIMO radar systems to achieve more accurate multi-target detection under equivalent power consumption and hardware cost as that of distributed phased-MIMO radar systems. Different from phased arrays, the RHS achieves beam steering by regulating the radiation amplitude of its elements, and thus conventional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays are no longer applicable. Aiming to maximize detection accuracy, we design an amplitude-controlled beamforming scheme for multiple RHS transceiver subarrays. The simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the distributed phased-MIMO radar scheme and reveal the optimal allocation of spatial diversity and coherent processing gain that leads to the best system performance when hardware resources are fixed.</description>

      <title>SemML: Enhancing Automata-Theoretic LTL Synthesis with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing a reactive system from specifications given in linear temporal logic (LTL) is a classical problem, finding its applications in safety-critical systems design. We present our tool SemML, which won this year's LTL realizability tracks of SYNTCOMP, after years of domination by Strix. While both tools are based on the automata-theoretic approach, ours relies heavily on (i) Semantic labelling, additional information of logical nature, coming from recent LTL-to-automata translations and decorating the resulting parity game, and (ii) Machine Learning approaches turning this information into a guidance oracle for on-the-fly exploration of the parity game (whence the name SemML). Our tool fills the missing gaps of previous suggestions to use such an oracle and provides an efficeint implementation with additional algorithmic improvements. We evaluate SemML both on the entire set of SYNTCOMP as well as a synthetic data set, compare it to Strix, and analyze the advantages and limitations. As SemML solves more instances on SYNTCOMP and does so significantly faster on larger instances, this demonstrates for the first time that machine-learning-aided approaches can out-perform state-of-the-art tools in real LTL synthesis.</description>

      <title>A Centralized Planning and Distributed Execution Method for Shape Filling with Homogeneous Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pattern formation task is commonly seen in a multi-robot system. In this paper, we study the problem of forming complex shapes with functionally limited mobile robots, which have to rely on other robots to precisely locate themselves. The goal is to decide whether a given shape can be filled by a given set of robots; in case the answer is yes, to complete a shape formation process as fast as possible with a minimum amount of communication. Traditional approaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to failure when attempting to form complex shapes beyond the capability of given approaches - the latter calls for a decision procedure that can tell whether a target shape can be formed before the actual shape-forming process starts. In this paper, we develop a method that does not require global coordinate information during the execution process and can effectively decide whether it is feasible to form the desired shape. The latter is achieved via a planning procedure that is capable of handling a variety of complex shapes, in particular, those with holes, and assigning a simple piece of scheduling information to each robot, facilitating subsequent distributed execution, which does not rely on the coordinates of all robots but only those of neighboring ones. The effectiveness of our shape-forming approach is vividly illustrated in several simulation case studies.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</description>

      <title>Safety with Agency: Human-Centered Safety Filter with Application to AI-Assisted Motorsports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel state-action control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in "driving on the edge" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.</description>
