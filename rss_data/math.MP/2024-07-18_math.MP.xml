      <title>Moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda_X(s)=\det(I-sX^{\dagger})$ be the characteristic polynomial of the unitary matrix $X$. It is believed that the distribution of values of $\Lambda_X(s)$ model the distribution of values of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. This principle motivates many avenues of study. Of particular interest is the behavior of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ and the distribution of its zeros (all of which lie inside or on the unit circle). In this article we present several identities for the moments of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ averaged over $U(N)$, for $x \in \mathbb{C}$ as well as specialized to $|x|=1$. Additionally, we prove, for positive integer $k$, that the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X(1)|^{2k} dX$ of degree $k^2$ in $N$ divides the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X'(1)|^{2k} dX$ which is of degree $k^2+2k$ in $N$ and that the ratio, $f(N,k)$, of these moments factors into linear factors modulo $4k-1$ if $4k-1$ is prime. We also discuss the relationship of these moments to a solution of a second order non-linear Painl\'{e}ve differential equation. Finally we give some formulas in terms of the $_3F_2$ hypergeometric series for the moments in the simplest case when $N=2$, and also study the radial distribution of the zeros of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ in that case.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Emulations in Classical Spin Models: Modularity and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of spin models intersects with complex systems, graph theory, combinatorial optimization, computational complexity and neural networks. Many ensuing applications rely on the fact that complicated spin models can be transformed to simpler ones. What is the structure of such transformations? Here, we provide a framework to study and construct emulations between spin models. A spin model is a set of spin systems, and emulations are efficiently computable simulations with arbitrary energy cut-off, where a source spin system simulates a target system if, below the cut-off, the target Hamiltonian is encoded in the source Hamiltonian. We prove that emulations preserve important properties, as they induce reductions between computational problems such as computing ground states, approximating partition functions and approximate sampling from Boltzmann distributions. Emulations are modular (they can be added, scaled and composed), and allow for universality, i.e. certain spin models have maximal reach. We prove that a spin model is universal if and only if it is scalable, closed and functional complete. Because the characterization is constructive, it provides a step-by-step guide to construct emulations. We prove that the 2d Ising model with fields is universal, for which we also provide two new crossing gadgets. Finally, we show that simulations can be computed by linear programs. While some ideas of this work are contained in [1], we provide new definitions and theorems. This framework provides a toolbox for applications involving emulations of spin models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the family $H_{\gamma \lambda \mu}(K)$, $K\in \mathbb{T}^2,$ of discrete Schr\"odinger operators, associated to the Hamiltonian of a system of two identical bosons on the two-dimen\-sional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2,$ interacting through on one site, nearest-neighbour sites and next-nearest-neighbour sites with interaction magnitudes $\gamma,\lambda$ and $\mu,$ respectively. We prove there existence an important invariant subspace of operator $H_{\gamma \lambda \mu}(0)$ such that the restriction of the operator $H_{\gamma \lambda \mu}(0)$ on this subspace has at most two eigenvalues lying both as below the essential spectrum as well as above it, depending on the interaction magnitude $\lambda,\mu\in \mathbb{R}$ (only). We also give a sharp lower bound for the number of eigenvalues of $H_{\gamma\lambda\mu}(K)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Groups of causal and conformal automorphisms of globally hyperbolic spacetimes were studied.
  In two dimensions, we prove that all globally hyperbolic spacetimes that are directed and connected are causally isomorphic. We work out the consequences of this fact and obtain a (partial) classification of the causal automorphism and conformal groups of a two-dimensional globally hyperbolic space.
  Finally, we present a generalization for locally conformally flat globally hyperbolic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow in initial data sets and applications to General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich. Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau, we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the ST-CMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the KPZ equation with non-integrable spatial correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large scale fluctuations of the KPZ equation in dimensions $d \geq 3$ driven by Gaussian noise that is white in time Gaussian but features non-integrable spatial correlation with decay rate $\kappa \in (2, d)$ and a suitable limiting profile. We show that its scaling limit is described by the corresponding additive stochastic heat equation. In contrast to the case of compactly supported covariance, the noise in the stochastic heat equation retains spatial correlation with covariance $|x|^{-\kappa}$. Surprisingly, the noise driving the limiting equation turns out to be the scaling limit of the noise driving the KPZ equation so that, under a suitable coupling, one has convergence in probability, unlike in the case of integrable correlations where fluctuations are enhanced in the limit and convergence is necessarily weak.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The defect-type solutions of a deformed $O(2N+1)$ linear sigma model with a real and $N$ complex fields in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime are studied. All the solutions are analytically found for the $N=2$ case. Two types of solitons have been determined: (a) Simple solutions formed by a topological kink with or without the presence of a $Q$-ball. (b) Composite solutions. They are constituted by some one-parameter families of solutions which can be understood as a non-linear combination of simple solutions. The properties of all of those solutions and the analysis of their linear stability, as well as decay channels, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitation as a Statistical Theory on the Light Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will explore Padmanabhan's mesoscopic, statistical approach to gravity [62] with a twist. The general picture of his approach is that spacetime is made of large numbers of localized quantum degrees of freedom. Padmanabhan assumed that the degrees of freedom of a given quantum state of geometry contribute, after averaging over fluctuations, a vector degree of freedom for space-time at a point. For null vectors, this can be regarded as corresponding to one single vector, i.e. a pure state, for the statistical ensemble on the light cone at every point. In the present paper, we consider instead the case where the states of the gravitational degrees of freedom are spread out and overlap, with only probabilistic information on which of them determines the actual spacetime at a point. In the continuum limit, this corresponds to a mixed state for the statistical ensemble on the light cone at every point. This change in assumptions leads to some interesting observations. When we define a statistical ensemble on the light cone, its variance "knows" about the interior of the light cone. As an intriguing consequence, we find that the cosmological constant can be related to the variance over the light cone. With a mixed state, we can no longer derive the gravitational field equations from an entropy functional. Here, instead, we show that a naive implementation of the measure of a mixed state on the light cone in the variation principle leads to modified measure theories (MMT) as the grand canonical ensemble and allows one to reframe unimodular gravity as the canonical ensemble of a statistical theory on the light cone.</description>

      <title>On entropy and complexity of coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consanguinity of entropy and complexity is pointed out through the example of coherent states of the $SL(2,\C)$ group. Both are obtained from the K\"ahler potential of the underlying geometry of the sphere corresponding to the Fubini-Study metric. Entropy is shown to be equal to the K\"ahler potential written in terms of dual symplectic variables as the Guillemin potential for toric manifolds. The logarithm of complexity relating two states is shown to be equal to Calabi's diastasis function. Optimality of the Fubini-Study metric is indicated by considering its deformation.</description>

      <title>The integration problem for principal connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Integration Problem for principal connections. Just as a principal connection on a principal bundle $\phi:Q\rightarrow M$ may be used to split $TQ$ into horizontal and vertical subbundles, a discrete connection may be used to split $Q\times Q$ into horizontal and vertical submanifolds. All discrete connections induce a connection on the same principal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The Integration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection $\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection is $\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \emph{flat} principal connections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the \emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition on the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\phi$, we prove that the existence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be unique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and discrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained by those curvatures.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional forest fires with boundary ignitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classical Drossel-Schwabl forest fire process, vertices of a lattice become occupied at rate $1$, and they are hit by lightning at some tiny rate $\zeta &gt; 0$, which causes entire connected components to burn. In this paper, we study a variant where fires are coming from the boundary of the forest instead.
  In particular we prove that, for the case without recoveries where the forest is an $N \times N$ box in the triangular lattice, the probability that the center of the box gets burnt tends to $0$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$ (but substantially slower than the one-arm probability of critical Bernoulli percolation). And, for the case where the forest is the upper-half plane, we show (still for the version without recoveries) that no infinite occupied cluster emerges. We also discuss analogs of some of these results for the corresponding models with recoveries, and explain how our results and proofs give valuable insight on a process considered earlier by Graf.</description>

      <title>Barycentric bounds on the error exponents of quantum hypothesis exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a nonadaptive strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the dynamical symmetries of classical supersymmetric oscillators, in one and two spatial (bosonic) dimensions. Our main ingredient is a generalized Poisson bracket, which is defined as a suitable classical counterpart to commutators and anticommutators. In one dimension, i.e., in the presence of one bosonic and one fermionic coordinate, the Hamiltonian admits a $U(1,1)$ symmetry, for which we explicitly compute the first integrals. It is found that suitable forms of the supercharges emerge in a natural way as fermionic conserved quantities. Following this, we describe classical supercharge operators based on the generalized Poisson bracket, and subsequently define supersymmetry transformations. We perform a straightforward generalization to two spatial dimensions, where the Hamiltonian has an overall $U(2,2)$ symmetry. We comment on plausible supersymmetric generalizations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck and isotonic oscillators, and also present the possibility of defining a generalized Nambu bracket within the classical formalism.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the atomistic spin system in $\rm CrCl_{3}$, which exhibits topologically nontrivial meron structures within its layered hexagonal lattice framework. We analyze the complete model of discrete spin dynamics on a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice and demonstrate its convergence to the continuum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the weak sense. The primary challenge lies in defining appropriate difference quotient and interpolation operators for the hexagonal lattice since the loss of symmetry. To address these, we utilized a one-step difference quotient for the 2nd nearest neighbors and introduced novel multi-step difference quotients for the 1st and 3rd nearest neighbors, enabling the integration by parts formula. Additionally, we generalized Ladysenskaya's interpolation operator for hexagonal lattices and provided an alternative strategy for the convergence procedure by applying an isometric mapping property. This work provides necessary tools for analyzing weak convergence in other atomistic nonlinear problems on hexagonal lattices towards the continuum limit.</description>

Abstract: The theory of Poisson-Lie groups and Lie bialgebras plays a major role in the study of one dimensional integrable systems; many families of integrable systems can be recovered from a Lax pair which is constructed from a Lie bialgebra associated to a Poisson-Lie group. A higher homotopy notion of Poisson-Lie groups and Lie bialgebras has been studied using Lie algebra crossed-modules and $L_2$-algebras, which gave rise to the notion of (strict) Lie 2-bialgebras and Poisson-Lie 2-groups . In this paper, we use these structures to generalize the construction of a Lax pairs and introduce an appropriate notion of {higher homotopy integrability}. Within this framework, we introduce a higher homotopy version of the Kac-Moody algebra, with which the 2-Lax equation can be rewritten as a zero 2-curvature condition in 2+1d. An explicit characterization of our higher Kac-Moody algebra will be given, and we also demonstrate how it governs the 2-Lax pairs and the symmetries of a 3d topological-holomorphic field theory studied recently. This 3d theory thus serves as an example of a physical system that exhibits the sort of 2-graded integrability that we have defined here.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description and macroscopic limit of swarming dynamics with continuous leader-follower transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a kinetic description of swarming particle dynamics in an interacting multi-agent system featuring emerging leaders and followers. Agents are classically characterized by their position and velocity plus a continuous parameter quantifying their degree of leadership. The microscopic processes ruling the change of velocity and degree of leadership are independent, non-conservative and non-local in the physical space, so as to account for long-range interactions. Out of the kinetic description, we obtain then a macroscopic model under a hydrodynamic limit reminiscent of that used to tackle the hydrodynamics of weakly dissipative granular gases, thus relying in particular on a regime of small non-conservative and short-range interactions. Numerical simulations in one- and two-dimensional domains show that the limiting macroscopic model is consistent with the original particle dynamics and furthermore can reproduce classical emerging patterns typically observed in swarms.</description>

Abstract: A new algebra, hitherto not encountered in the usual Lie algebraic varieties or supervarieties, is introduced. The paper explores the rich and novel structure of the algebra, and it compares it on the one hand with the Jordan-Lie Superalgebras studied by Okubo and Kamiya, and on the other, with the four usual Euclidean division rings of the reals (R), the complexes (C), the quaternions (H) and the octonions (O), key algebraic properties of which the algebra is seen to combine, alter, extend and generalise. A potential physical application of the algebra is briefly alluded to at the end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Laurent property, the irreducibility and the coprimeness for lattice equations (partial difference equations), mainly focusing on how the choice of initial value problem (the choice of domain) affects these properties. We show that these properties do not depend on the choice of domain as long as they are considered together. In other words, these properties are inherent to a difference equation. Applying our result, we discuss the reductions of lattice equations. We show that any reduction of a Laurent system, even if the lattices have torsion elements, preserves the Laurent property.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past thirty years there has been an ever-increasing interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven in large part by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with splitting the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is simple and unambiguous for massive particles, there are many different proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been explicitly shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, like photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We show that the obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-$\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale dynamics of the solution to a nonlinear stochastic heat equation (SHE) in dimensions $d \geq 3$ with long-range dependence. This equation is driven by multiplicative Gaussian noise, which is white in time and coloured in space with non-integrable spatial covariance that decays at the rate of $|x|^{-\kappa}$ at infinity, where $\kappa \in (2, d)$. Inspired by recent studies on SHE and KPZ equations driven by noise with compactly supported spatial correlation, we demonstrate that the correlations persist in the large-scale limit. The fluctuations of the diffusively scaled solution converge to the solution of a stochastic heat equation with additive noise whose correlation is the Riesz kernel of degree $-\kappa$. Moreover, the fluctuations converge as a distribution-valued process in the optimal H\"older topologies.</description>

      <title>Dispersive decay estimates for Dirac equations with a domain wall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dispersive time-decay estimates are proved for a one-parameter family of one-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonians with dislocations; these are operators which interpolate between two phase-shifted massive Dirac Hamiltonians at $x=+\infty$ and $x=-\infty$. This family of Hamiltonians arises in the theory of topologically protected states of one-dimensional quantum materials. For certain values of the phase-shift parameter, $\tau$, the Dirac Hamiltonian has a {\it threshold resonance} at the endpoint of its essential spectrum. Such resonances are known to influence the time-decay rate. Our main result explicitly displays the transition in time-decay rate as $\tau$ varies between resonant and non-resonant values. Our results appear to be the first dispersive time-decay estimates for Dirac Hamiltonians which are not a relatively compact perturbation of a free Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>Equality in some symplectic eigenvalue inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, numerous works have investigated several properties of symplectic eigenvalues. Remarkably, the results on symplectic eigenvalues have been found to be analogous to those of eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices with appropriate interpretations. In particular, symplectic analogs of famous eigenvalue inequalities are known today such as Weyl's inequalities, Lidskii's inequalities, and Schur--Horn majorization inequalities. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for equality in the symplectic analogs of the aforementioned inequalities. The equality conditions for the symplectic Weyl's and Lidskii's inequalities turn out to be analogous to the known equality conditions for eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Purcell-type microswimmers with active-elastic joints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purcell's planar three-link microswimmer is a classic model of swimming in low-Reynolds-number fluid, inspired by motion of flagellated microorganisms. Many works analyzed this model, assuming that the two joint angles are directly prescribed in phase-shifted periodic inputs. In this work, we study a more realistic scenario by considering an extension of this model which accounts for joints' elasticity and mechanical actuation of periodic torques, so that the joint angles are dynamically evolving. Numerical analysis of the swimmer's dynamics reveals multiplicity of periodic solutions, depending on parameters of the inputs - frequency and amplitude of excitation, joints' stiffness ratio, as well as joint's activation. We numerically study swimming direction reversal, as well as bifurcations, stability transitions, and symmetry breaking of the periodic solutions, which represent the effect of buckling instability observed in swimming microorganisms. The results demonstrate that this variant of Purcell's simple model displays rich nonlinear dynamic behavior with actuated-elastic joints. Similar results are also obtained when studying an extended model of a six-link microswimmer.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter-Toda spectral duality and quantum groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hofstadter model allows to describe and understand several phenomena in condensed matter such as the quantum Hall effect, Anderson localization, charge pumping, and flat-bands in quasiperiodic structures, and is a rare example of fractality in the quantum world. An apparently unrelated system, the relativistic Toda lattice, has been extensively studied in the context of complex nonlinear dynamics, and more recently for its connection to supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and topological string theories on Calabi-Yau manifolds in high-energy physics. Here we discuss a recently discovered spectral relationship between the Hofstadter model and the relativistic Toda lattice which has been later conjectured to be related to the Langlands duality of quantum groups. Moreover, by employing similarity transformations compatible with the quantum group structure, we establish a formula parametrizing the energy spectrum of the Hofstadter model in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials. The main tools used are the spectral duality of tridiagonal matrices and the representation theory of the elementary quantum group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the representation principle to study physical systems with a given symmetry. In the context of symmetry enriched topological orders, we give the appropriate representation category, the category of SET orders. For fusion n-category symmetries, we show that the category of SET orders encodes almost all information about the interplay between symmetry and topological orders, in a natural and canonical way. These information include defects and boundaries of SET orders, symmetry charges, explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, stacking of SET orders, gauging of generalized symmetry, as well as quantum currents (SymTFT or symmetry TO). We also provide a detailed categorical algorithm to compute the generalized gauging. In particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible, as a special type of Morita-equivalence. The explicit data for ungauging, the inverse to gauging, is given.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed information flow through a wormhole in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter aims to advance unexplored properties of a new class of Closed Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity, reported in Universe 9, 467 (2023) and Eur.$\,$Phys.$\,$J.$\,$C 83, 626 (2023). Therein, it was shown that when the Weak Energy Condition is violated, the topology of spacetime in scalar-tensor gravity is altered, enabling the formation of two-way traversable wormholes. Furthermore, each of these wormholes acts a gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially, due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time. This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for timelike paths that experience time reversal.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density from the form factor bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The form-factor bootstrap is incomplete until one normalizes the zero-particle form factor. For the stress energy tensor we describe how to obtain the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} | 0 \rangle = \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, from the form-factor bootstrap. Even for integrable QFT's in D=2 spacetime dimensions, this prescription is new, although it reproduces previously known results obtained in a different and more difficult thermodynamic Bethe ansatz computation. We propose a version of this prescription in D=4 dimensions. For these even dimensions, the vacuum energy density has the universal form $\rho_{\rm vac} \propto m^D/\mathfrak{g}$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a dimensionless interaction coupling constant which can be determined from the high energy behavior of the S-matrix. In the limit $\mathfrak{g} \to 0$, $\rho_{\rm vac} $ diverges due to well understood UV divergences in free quantum field theories. If we assume the the observed Cosmological Constant originates from the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$ computed as proposed here, then this suggests there must exist a particle which does not obtain its mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electro-weak sector, which we designate as the "zeron". A strong candidate for the zeron is a massive Majorana neutrino.</description>
