      <title>Conductive homogeneity of locally symmetric polygon-based self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rich family of self-similar sets, called locally symmetric polygon-based self-similar sets, as examples of metric spaces having conductive homogeneity, which was introduced as a sufficient condition for the construction of counterparts of ``Sobolev spaces'' on compact metric spaces. In particular, our results imply the existence of ``Brownian motions'' on our family of self-similar sets at the same time. Unlike the known examples like the Sierpinski carpet by Barlow-Bass, unconstrained carpet by Cao and Qiu and the Octa-carpet by Andrews, our examples may have no global symmetries, i.e. the group of isometries is trivial.</description>

      <title>On the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the cloud of bounded metric spaces and a cloud with nontrivial stabilizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the class of all metric spaces considered up to zero Gromov-Hausdorff distance between them. In this class, we examine clouds - classes of spaces situated at finite Gromov-Hausdorff distances from a reference space. We prove that all clouds are proper classes. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is defined for clouds similarly with the case of that for metric spaces. A multiplicative group of transformations of clouds is defined which is called stabilizer. We show that under certain restrictions the distance between the cloud of bounded metric spaces and a cloud with a nontrivial stabilizer is finite. In particular, the distance between the cloud of bounded metric spaces and the cloud containing the real line is calculated.</description>

      <title>Brunn-Minkowski and Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities for Dual Quermassintegrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes two new geometric inequalities in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. The first, originally conjectured by Lutwak, is the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for dual quermassintegrals of origin-symmetric convex bodies. The second, generalizing Ball's volume ratio inequality, is a reverse isoperimetric inequality: among all origin-symmetric convex bodies in John's position, the cube maximizes the dual quermassintegrals.</description>

      <title>Separating dots with circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of points in general position in the plane or sphere, we count the number of ways to separate those points using two types of circles: circles through three of the points, and circles through none of the points (up to an equivalence). In each case, we show the number of circles which separate the points into subsets of size k and l is independent of the configuration of points, and we provide an explicit formula in each case. We also consider how the circles change as the configuration of dots varies continuously. We show that an associated higher order Voronoi decomposition of the sphere changes by a sequence of local `moves'. As a consequence, an associated cluster algebra is independent of the configuration of dots, and only depends on the number of dots and the order of the Voronoi decomposition.</description>

      <title>Cell structure of mediangle graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genevois introduced and investigated mediangle graphs as a common generalization of median graphs (1-sekeleta of CAT(0) cube complexes) and Coxeter graphs (Cayley graphs of Coxeter groups) and studied groups acting on them. He asked if mediangle graphs can be endowed with the structure of a contractible cell complex. We answer this in the affirmative by proving that (bipartite) mediangle graphs are tope graphs of finitary Complexes of Oriented Matroids (COMs). We also show that the oriented matroids (OMs) constituting the cells of COMs arising from mediangle graphs are exactly the simplicial OMs.</description>

      <title>Volume Entropy Rigidity for Random Groups at Low Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rigidity of the volume entropy for weighted word metrics on hyperbolic groups, building on a recent convexity result due to Cantrell-Tanaka. Using ideas from small cancellation theory, we give conditions under which a hyperbolic group admits a unique normalized weight minimizing the entropy. Moreover, we show that these conditions are generic for random groups at small densities, and that the unique minimizer of such a generic group is arbitrarily close to the uniform weight.</description>

      <title>The bi-Lipschitz constant of an isothermal coordinate chart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $C^{2}$-smooth Riemannian surface. A classical theorem in differential geometry states that the Gauss curvature function $K : M \to \mathbb{R}$ vanishes everywhere if and only if the surface is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane. We give an asymptotically sharp quantitative version of this theorem with respect to an isothermal coordinate chart. Roughly speaking, we show that if $B$ is a Riemannian disc of radius $\delta &gt; 0$ with $\delta^{2}\sup_{B}|K| &lt; \varepsilon$ for some $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$, then there is an isothermal coordinate map from $B$ onto an Euclidean disc of radius $\delta$ which is bi-Lipschitz with constant $\exp(4 \varepsilon)$.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'e inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in \textit{any} normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'e constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'e constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call \emph{long range expansion}, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends \emph{polynomially} on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space with an unconditional basis which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>
