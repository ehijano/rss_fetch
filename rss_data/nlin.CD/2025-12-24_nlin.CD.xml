      <title>The relation between classical and quantum Lyapunov exponent and the bound on chaos in classically chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Time-Ordered Commutators (OTOCs), representing a key diagnostic for scrambling as a facet of short-time quantum chaos, have attracted wide-ranging interest, from many-body physics to quantum gravity. By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $\Lambda$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $\beta$.
  We show that the scaled growth rate, $\Lambda/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f \beta$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity. In this way, we present first evidence of maximally fast scrambling in a quantum chaotic system with a well-defined classical Hamiltonian limit, without invoking any external mechanism such as (disorder) averaging.</description>

      <title>Systematic Classification of History-Dependent Invariants in the Lorenz System: Regularization Classes and Dynamical Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the recent discovery of history-dependent dynamical invariants in the Lorenz system, this work presents a systematic classification of a complete family of such conserved quantities. Analysis of all 24 permutations in the augmented phase space identifies eighteen distinct invariants ($K_1-K_{18}$) organized into three regularization classes: Class I (permutations $1abc$), Class II ($2abc$), and Class III ($3abc$). Six permutations ($4abc$) yield null results due to Schwarz integrability conditions. Each class is characterized by a distinct polynomial factor that removes singularities at nullcline crossings. The regularized variable $v_n = p\, u_n$ evolves according to $dv_n/dt = Q_n(x,y,z)$, independent of $v_n$ itself; different conservation laws thereby impose distinct measures of trajectory history. Any three invariants from different classes provide independent constraints, defining a canonical Triad that characterizes orbit structure. Statistical analysis reveals class-dependent dynamical signatures: Class III invariants display higher intermittency (kurtosis ~15 versus ~8 for Class I) and stronger asymmetry (skewness ~2.7 versus ~1.6), correlating with lobe-switching events where the product $xy$ undergoes rapid sign reversal. This geometric sensitivity establishes Class III invariants as probes of topological transitions, while Class I invariants track continuous dynamics. The class-dependent divergence quantifies how different conservation principles impose incompatible demands on trajectory history. High-precision numerical validation confirms conservation of all identified quantities.</description>

      <title>Edge-of-chaos enhanced quantum-inspired algorithm for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by physics-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>Time-Crystalline Phase in a Single-Band Holographic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a time-crystalline phase in a single-band holographic superconductor, extending the AdS/CFT framework. By incorporating a nonlinear gauge-scalar coupling and external driving, we derive coupled equations of motion for the plasma and Higgs modes, analogous to those in high-Tc superconductors. Multi-scale analysis reveals a sum resonance with subharmonic growth indicating broken time-translation symmetry. We perform numerical computation of quasinormal mode and demonstrate the transition to the time-crystalline phase. The holographic model may serve as a robust tool for studying strongly coupled time crystals.</description>
