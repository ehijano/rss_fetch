      <title>Linewidth narrowing and wideband frequency modulation of a DBR laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme to phase-lock a 240 mW, 852 nm distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser to a fixed-frequency narrow-linewidth laser with a rapidly tunable frequency offset near 9 GHz. The phase-lock is accomplished by electronic feedback on the beatnote between the two lasers. The frequency offset can be swept 200 MHz in 300 us, limited by the feedback loop bandwidth, allowing for its use in complex cooling and state preparation schemes needed in atomic physics experiments. Additionally, we find that the phase-lock reduces the linewidth of the DBR laser below its natural linewidth of ~400 kHz to ~100 kHz.</description>

      <title>Correlation-induced phase shifts and time delays in resonance enhanced high harmonic generation from Cr+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate resonance-enhanced high harmonic generation (rHHG) in Cr+ by comparing a 1D shape-resonant model, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and independent particle approximation (IPA) simulations. Previous studies linked rHHG to the 3p -&gt; 3d giant resonance, suggesting a modified four-step model where recolliding electrons are first captured in the autoionizing state before recombining into the ground state, potentially leading to an emission delay associated with the resonance lifetime. While both the 1D-model and TDDFT reproduce experimental spectra, TDDFT reveals that rHHG counterintuitively originates from spin-down 3p states, while spin-up 3d electrons negligibly contribute. The IPA fails to reproduce rHHG, highlighting the significance of electron correlations. Furthermore, TDDFT revealed a correlation induced ~480 attosecond time delay, accompanied by a strong phase shift across the resonance, potentially explaining earlier RABBIT measurements. Our work sheds light on long-standing open questions in rHHG and should advance novel ultrafast spectroscopies of electron correlations and resonances.</description>

      <title>Blackbody radiation Zeeman shift in Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Zeeman shift in Rydberg atoms induced by room-temperature blackbody radiation (BBR). BBR shifts to the Rydberg levels are dominated by the familiar BBR Stark shift. However, the BBR Stark shift and the BBR Zeeman shift exhibit different behaviors with respect to the principal quantum number of the Rydberg electron. Namely, the BBR Stark shift asymptotically approaches a constant value given by a universal expression, whereas the BBR Zeeman shift grows steeply with principal quantum number due to the diamagnetic contribution. We show that for transitions between Rydberg states, where only the differential shift between levels is of concern, the BBR Zeeman shift can surpass the BBR Stark shift. We exemplify this in the context of a proposed experiment targeting a precise determination of the Rydberg constant.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Pump-Probe Experiment to Observe Zeeman Wave Packet Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the coherent dynamics of an atomic Zeeman wave packet using a continuous pump--probe scheme. A polarized wave packet is generated via few-photon excitation by a femtosecond laser pulse, creating a state with a magnetic moment tilted relative to an external magnetic field. The subsequent Larmor precession of the atoms is probed by continuous ionization in the field of an optical dipole trap (ODT) laser. Photoelectrons and photoions are detected in coincidence using a cold target recoil ion momentum spectrometer (COLTRIMS). While the addition of the ODT enables further cooling of the atomic ensemble, it removes the pulsed timing reference typically used to extract photoelectron momentum distributions in COLTRIMS. Here, we present a method that extends the standard COLTRIMS technique by exploiting redundancy in the measured data to reconstruct the time of ionization. The resulting time-dependent ionization signal reflects the coherent precession of the atomic magnetic moment, enabling real-time access to atomic dynamics on nanosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dress-State Engineered Rydberg Electrometry: Achieving 100-MHz-level Instantaneous-Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, with their giant electric dipole moments and tunable energy-level transitions, offer exceptional potential for microwave (MW) electric field sensing, combining high sensitivity and broad frequency coverage. However, simultaneously achieving high sensitivity and wide instantaneous bandwidth in a Rydberg-based MW transducer remains a critical challenge. Here, we propose a multi-dress-state engineered superheterodyne detection scheme for Rydberg electrometry that exploits a detuning-dependent dual-peak response structure and a Rabi-frequency-driven dip-lifting effect to overcome the limitation on instantaneous bandwidth. By strategically engineering the multiple dress states of Rydberg atoms, we demonstrate a thermal $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ vapor-based transducer with a record sensitivity of $\mathrm{140.4\,nV\,cm^{-1}\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ and an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 54.6$\,$MHz. The performance metrics are now approaching the practical requirements of modern MW receivers (100-MHz-level) in certain application fields. This advancement bridges the gap between atomic sensing and real-world applications, paving the way for Rydberg-atom technologies in radar,wireless communication, and spectrum monitoring.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of barium monofluoride: Odd isotopologues, hyperfine structure and isotope shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barium monofluoride (BaF) is a promising molecular species for precision tests of fundamental symmetries and interactions. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of BaF spectra and isotope shifts, focusing in particular on the poorly understood odd isotopologues 137BaF and 135BaF. By comparing state-of-the-art ab initio calculations with high-resolution fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy data, we provide a benchmark for electronic structure theory and disentangle the hyperfine and rovibrational spectra of the five most abundant isotopologues, from 138BaF to 134BaF. The comprehensive knowledge gained enables a King plot analysis of the isotope shifts that reveals the odd-even staggering of the barium nuclear charge radii. It also paths the way for improved laser cooling of rare BaF isotopologues and crucially supports future measurements of nuclear anapole and Schiff moments.</description>

      <title>Probing "Continuous Spin" QED with Rare Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An intriguing and elementary possibility is that familiar massless particles like the photon could be "continuous spin" particles (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. In this case, the familiar two polarization states of the photon are accompanied by an infinite tower of integer spaced helicity modes, with couplings dictated entirely by Lorentz symmetry and the parameter $\rho$. We present a formalism for computing bound state atomic transitions for scalar QED when $\rho \neq 0$, employing path integral methods not often used for bound state computations, but that readily generalize to the CSP case. We compute several illustrative amplitudes and show that $\rho\neq 0$ opens new decay channels for atomic transitions with rates controlled by $\rho\alpha/\omega$ for transition frequency $\omega$. These new channels can appreciably modify the rates of "forbidden" transitions. For example, the lifetime of the hydrogen $2s$ state would be affected at $O(1)$ for $\rho\sim 0.1$ eV, suggesting new directions for fundamental tests of QED in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Topology in a Single-Atom Synthetic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice, we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, representing the geometric phase difference between two sublattices, can also be computed using a phase-space parameter and corresponds directly to the phase-space winding number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected fermionic states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</description>
