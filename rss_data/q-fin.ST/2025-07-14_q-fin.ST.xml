      <title>Temperature Measurement in Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for spin systems, known from statistical physics, are applied analogously in econometrics in the form of agent-based models. The models discussed in the econophysics literature all use the state variable $T$, which, in physics, represents the temperature of a system. However, there is little evidence on how temperature can be measured in econophysics, so that the models can be applied. Only in idealized capital market applications has the relationship between temperature and volatility been demonstrated, allowing temperature to be determined through volatility measurements. The question remains how this can be achieved in agent systems beyond capital market applications. This paper focuses precisely on this question. It examines an agent system with two decision options in a news environment, establishes the measurement equation, and outlines the basic concept of temperature measurement. The procedure is illustrated using an example. In an application with competing subsystems, an interesting strategy for influencing the average opinion in the competing subsystem is presented.</description>

      <title>To Trade or Not to Trade: An Agentic Approach to Estimating Market Risk Improves Trading Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks, in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal. While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.</description>
