      <title>Cyclic solid-state quantum battery: Thermodynamic characterization and quantum hardware simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Field Theory Approach to Wavepacket Tunneling: Lack of Superluminal Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate relativistic wavepacket dynamics for an electron tunneling through a potential barrier employing space-time resolved solutions to relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) equations. We prove by linking the QFT property of micro-causality to the wavepacket behavior that the tunneling dynamics is fully causal, precluding instantaneous or superluminal effects that have recently been reported in the literature. We illustrate these results by performing numerical computations for an electron tunneling through a potential barrier for standard tunneling as well for Klein tunneling. In all cases (Klein tunneling \ or regular tunneling across a standard or a supercritical potential) the transmitted wavepacket remains in the causal envelope of the propagator, even when its average position lies ahead of the average position of the corresponding freely propagated wavepacket.</description>

      <title>Protein Design by Integrating Machine Learning with Quantum Annealing and Quantum-inspired Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The protein design problem involves finding polypeptide sequences folding into a given threedimensional structure. Its rigorous algorithmic solution is computationally demanding, involving a nested search in sequence and structure spaces. Structure searches can now be bypassed thanks to recent machine learning breakthroughs, which have enabled accurate and rapid structure predictions. Similarly, sequence searches might be entirely transformed by the advent of quantum annealing machines and by the required new encodings of the search problem, which could be performative even on classical machines. In this work, we introduce a general protein design scheme where algorithmic and technological advancements in machine learning and quantum-inspired algorithms can be integrated, and an optimal physics-based scoring function is iteratively learned. In this first proof-of-concept application, we apply the iterative method to a lattice protein model amenable to exhaustive benchmarks, finding that it can rapidly learn a physics-based scoring function and achieve promising design performances. Strikingly, our quantum-inspired reformulation outperforms conventional sequence optimization even when adopted on classical machines. The scheme is general and can be easily extended, e.g., to encompass off-lattice models, and it can integrate progress on various computational platforms, thus representing a new paradigm approach for protein design.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reality Erasure with Spacelike-Separated Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen argued that quantum mechanics is incomplete, based on the assumption that local actions cannot influence elements of reality at a distant location (local realism). In this work, using a recently defined quantum reality quantifier, we show that Alice's local quantum operations can be correlated with the erasure of the reality of observables in Bob's causally disconnected laboratory. To this end, we implement a modified optical quantum eraser experiment, ensuring that Alice's and Bob's measurements remain causally disconnected. Using an entangled pair of photons and quantum state tomography, we experimentally verify that, even with the total absence of any form of classical communication, the choice of quantum operation applied by Alice on her photon is correlated with the erasure of a spatial element of reality of Bob's photon. In this case, it is shown that Bob's photon can entangle two extra non-interacting degrees of freedom, thus confirming that Bob's photon path is not an element of physical reality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization: A Computational Intelligence Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field on the multidisciplinary interface between physics, engineering, and computer science with the potential to make a large impact on computational intelligence (CI). The aim of this paper is to introduce quantum approximate optimization methods to the CI community because of direct relevance to solving combinatorial problems. We introduce quantum computing and variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). VQAs are an effective method for the near-term implementation of quantum solutions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices with less reliable qubits and early-stage error correction. Then, we explain Farhi et al.'s quantum approximate optimization algorithm (Farhi's QAOA, to prevent confusion). This VQA is generalized by Hadfield et al. to the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA), which is a nature-inspired (particularly, adiabatic) quantum metaheuristic for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems on gate-based quantum computers. We discuss connections of QAOA to relevant domains, such as computational learning theory and genetic algorithms, discussing current techniques and known results regarding hybrid quantum-classical intelligence systems. We present a schematic of how QAOA is constructed, and also discuss how CI techniques can be used to improve QAOA. We conclude with QAOA implementations for the well-known maximum cut, maximum bisection, and traveling salesperson problems, which can serve as templates for CI practitioners interested in using QAOA.</description>

      <title>Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space Approach to Non-Markovian Quantum Stochastic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a derivation of the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion equation of Di{\'o}si and Strunz starting from a model of a quantum mechanical system coupled to a bosonic bath. We show that the complex trajectories arises as a consequence of using the Bargmann-Segal (complex wave) representation of the bath. In particular, we construct a reproducing kernel Hilbert space for the bath auto-correlation and realize the space of complex trajectories as a Hilbert subspace. The reproducing kernel naturally arises from a feature space where the underlying feature space is the one-particle Hilbert space of the bath quanta. We exploit this to derive the unravelling of the open quantum system dynamics and show equivalence to the equation of Di{\'o}si and Strunz. We also give an explicit expression for the reduced dynamics of a two-level system coupled to the bath via a Jaynes-Cummings interaction and show that this does indeed correspond to an exact solution of the Di{\'o}si-Strunz equation. Finally, we discuss the physical interpretation of the complex trajectories and show that they are intrinsically unobservable.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Imitation Game: Reverse Engineering of Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) amalgamates quantum computing paradigms with machine learning models, providing significant prospects for solving complex problems. However, with the expansion of numerous third-party vendors in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing, the security of QML models is of prime importance, particularly against reverse engineering, which could expose trained parameters and algorithms of the models. We assume the untrusted quantum cloud provider is an adversary having white-box access to the transpiled user-designed trained QML model during inference. Reverse engineering (RE) to extract the pre-transpiled QML circuit will enable re-transpilation and usage of the model for various hardware with completely different native gate sets and even different qubit technology. Such flexibility may not be obtained from the transpiled circuit which is tied to a particular hardware and qubit technology. The information about the number of parameters, and optimized values can allow further training of the QML model to alter the QML model, tamper with the watermark, and/or embed their own watermark or refine the model for other purposes. In this first effort to investigate the RE of QML circuits, we perform RE and compare the training accuracy of original and reverse-engineered Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) of various sizes. We note that multi-qubit classifiers can be reverse-engineered under specific conditions with a mean error of order 1e-2 in a reasonable time. We also propose adding dummy fixed parametric gates in the QML models to increase the RE overhead for defense. For instance, adding 2 dummy qubits and 2 layers increases the overhead by ~1.76 times for a classifier with 2 qubits and 3 layers with a performance overhead of less than 9%. We note that RE is a very powerful attack model which warrants further efforts on defenses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present examples where expressions for $\exp(\hat{A}+\hat{B})$ can be derived even though the operators (or superoperators) $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ do not commute in a manner that leads to known factorizations. We apply our factorization to the case of a Lindblad operator modeling single photon decay and to a binary Glauber-Fock photonic lattice.</description>

      <title>BHT-QAOA: Generalizing Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to Solve Arbitrary Boolean Problems as Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new methodology is proposed to solve classical Boolean problems as Hamiltonians, using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Our methodology successfully finds all optimized approximated solutions for Boolean problems, after converting them from Boolean oracles (in different structures) into Phase oracles, and then into the Hamiltonians of QAOA. From such a conversion, we noticed that the total utilized numbers of qubits and quantum gates are dramatically minimized for the final quantum circuits of Hamiltonians. In this paper, arbitrary classical Boolean problems are examined by successfully solving them with our proposed methodology, using structures based on various logic synthesis methods, an IBM quantum computer, and a classical optimization minimizer. Accordingly, this methodology will provide broad opportunities to solve many classical Boolean problems as Hamiltonians, for the practical engineering applications of several algorithms, robotics, machine learning, just to name a few, in the hybrid classical-quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase and Topological Insights in a Qubit-Inspired Classical Two-Level Elastic Bit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the Berry phase in classical mechanics has opened new frontiers in understanding the dynamics of physical systems, analogous to quantum mechanics. Here, we show controlled accumulation of the Berry phase in a two-level elastic bit, which are classical counterparts of qubits, achieved by manipulating coupled granules with external drivers. Employing the Bloch sphere representation, the paper demonstrates the manipulation of elastic bit states and the realization of quantum-analogue logic gates. A key achievement is the calculation of the Berry phase for various system states, revealing insights into the system's topological nature. Unique to this study is the use of external parameters to explore topological transitions, contrasting with traditional approaches focusing on internal system modifications. By linking the classical and quantum worlds through the Berry phase of an elastic bit, this work extends the potential applications of topological concepts in designing new materials and computational models.</description>

      <title>MagicPool: Dealing with Magic State Distillation Failures on Large-Scale Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state distillation, which is a probabilistic process used to generate magic states, plays an important role in universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. On the other hand, to solve interesting problems, we need to run complex programs on fault-tolerant quantum computers, and hence, the system needs to use hardware resources efficiently. Taking advantage of parallelism is a major optimization strategy and compilers are responsible for performing optimizations to allow parallel processing. However, the probabilistic nature of magic state distillation is not compatible with compile-time optimizations and results in an additional run-time delay. To reduce the additional run-time delay, we propose introducing a pool of magic states. We run simulations of quantum circuits to verify the magnitude of the run-time delay and the usefulness of the mitigation approach. The experimental results show that the run-time delay is amplified by parallel processing, and pooling effectively reduces the run-time delay with a small spatial cost.</description>

      <title>Krylov fractality and complexity in generic random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.</description>

      <title>Photonic Entanglement and Polarization Nonclassicality: Two Manifestations, One Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate in theory and experiment the strict equivalence between nonclassical polarization and the entanglement of indistinguishable photons, thereby unifying these two phenomena that appear dissimilar at first sight. This allows us to analyze nonclassicality and multi-photon entanglement within the same framework. We experimentally verify this double-sided form of quantumness and its independence from the polarization basis, contrasting other notions of coherence that are highly basis-dependent. Our findings show how nonclassical polarization turns out to be equally resourceful for quantum protocols as entanglement, emphasizing its importance in practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum communication protocols, the use of photon-number-resolving detectors could open new perspectives by broadening the way to encode and decode information, and merging the properties of discrete and continuous variables. In this work, we consider a quantum channel exploiting a Silicon-photomultiplier-based receiver and evaluate its performance for quantum communication protocols under three possible configurations, defined by different post-processing of the detection outcomes. We investigate two scenarios: information transmission over the channel, quantified by the mutual information, and continuous-variable quantum key distribution. The preliminary results encourage further use of this detection scheme in extended networks.</description>

      <title>High-rate quantum digital signatures network with integrated silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum networks is paramount towards practical and secure communications. Quantum digital signatures (QDS) offer an information-theoretically secure solution for ensuring data integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation, rapidly growing from proof-of-concept to robust demonstrations. However, previous QDS systems relied on expensive and bulky optical equipment, limiting large-scale deployment and reconfigurable networking construction. Here, we introduce and verify a chip-based QDS network, placing the complicated and expensive measurement devices in the central relay while each user needs only a low-cost transmitter. We demonstrate the network with a three-node setup using an integrated encoder chip and decoder chip. By developing a 1-decoy-state one-time universal hash-QDS protocol, we achieve a maximum signature rate of 0.0414 times per second for a 1 Mbit file over fiber distances up to 200 km, surpassing all current state-of-the-art QDS experiments. This study validates the feasibility of chip-based QDS, paving the way for large-scale deployment and integration with existing fiber infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: We explore the interaction between a three-level atom and a single-mode quantized cavity, known as the three-level ladder-type Jaynes-Cummings model. By employing the exact solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, we investigate how the initial conditions of the atom influence the occupation probabilities of the atomic energy levels, average photon number, and the nonclassicality of light, assessed through the Mandel $\mathcal{Q} (t)$ parameter and the Wigner function. Our findings are rigorously validated through comprehensive numerical simulations, ensuring robust and consistent outcomes.</description>

      <title>Transforming qubits via quasi-geometric approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory based on quasi-geometric (QG) approach to transform a small number of qubits into a larger number of error-correcting qubits by considering four different cases. More precisely, we use the 2-dimensional quasi-orthogonal complete complementary codes (2D-QOCCCSs) and quasi-cyclic asymmetric quantum error-correcting codes (AQECCs) via quasigroup and group theory properties. We integrate the Pauli $X$-gate to detect and correct errors, as well as the Hadamard $H$-gate to superpose the initial and final qubits in the quantum circuit diagram. We compare the numerical results to analyze the success, consistency, and performance of the corrected errors through bar graphs for 2D-QOCCCs and AQECCs according to their characteristics. The difficulty in generating additional sets of results and counts for AQECCs arises because mapping a smaller initial number of qubits to a larger final number is necessary to correct more errors. For AQECCs, the number of errors that can be corrected must be equal to or less than the initial number of qubits. High error correction performance is observed when mapping 1-qubit state to 29-qubits to correct 5 errors using 2D-QOCCCs. Similarly, transforming 1-qubit to 13-qubits using AQECCs also shows high performance, successfully correcting 2 errors. The results show that our theory has the advantage of providing a basis for refining and optimizing these codes in future quantum computing applications due to its high performance in error correction.</description>

      <title>Suppressing photon detection errors in nondeterministic state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum computing has recently emerged as a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing by photonic qubits. These protocols make use of nondeterministic gates, enabling universal quantum computation. However, the suggested solutions heavily use particle number resolving detectors (PNRDs), which are experimentally hard to realize and are usually biased in practice. We investigate the possibility of suppressing such errors caused by such photodetector imperfections by adjusting the optimal beamsplitter and phaseshifter angles in the interferometer corresponding to nondeterministic gates. Moreover, we devise an optimization method for determining the adjusted angles, which may achieve higher output state fidelities while controlling the success probabilities of the nondeterministic gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the continuous variable (CV) dense coding protocol between a single sender and a single receiver when affected by noise in the shared and encoded states as well as when the decoding is imperfect. We derive a general formalism for the dense coding capacity (DCC) of generic two-mode Gaussian states. When the constituent modes are affected by quantum-limited amplifiers, pure-loss channels, and environmental interactions together with an inefficient decoding mechanism comprising imperfect double-homodyne detection, we investigate the pattern of DCC of the two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSV) by varying the strength of the noise. We further establish that the negative conditional entropy is responsible for providing quantum advantage in CV dense coding and identify a class of pure states capable of furnishing the maximal dense coding capacity equal to that of the TMSV under equal energy. We also demonstrate that, while the TMSV state provides the maximum quantum advantage in the DC protocol, there exists a class of states that is more resilient against noise than the TMSV state in the context of the DCC.</description>

      <title>Fusion of atomic W-like states in cavity QED systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that maximally entangled GHZ states can achieve perfect teleportation and superdense coding, whereas maximally entangled W states cannot. However, it has been demonstrated that there exists a special class of non-maximally entangled W states, called as \textit{W-like} states, which can overcome this limitation. Therefore, it is of great significance to prepare such W-like states for efficient quantum communication. Here, we propose two kinds of novel and efficient fusion schemes for atomic W-like states based on the large-detuning interactions between several atoms and a single-mode cavity field, with which large-scale atomic $|\mathcal{W}_{N+M-1}\rangle$ and $|\mathcal{W}_{N+M+T-2}\rangle$ states can be prepared, respectively, from two small-scale atomic $|\mathcal{W}_{N}\rangle$ and $|\mathcal{W}_{M}\rangle$ states and three small-scale atomic $|\mathcal{W}_{N}\rangle$, $|\mathcal{W}_{M}\rangle$ and $|\mathcal{W}_{T}\rangle$ states, by detecting the states of one or two of the fused atoms. Particularly, although the fusion process of our scheme involves particle loss, the corresponding success probability is high and fixed, which may induce high fusion efficiency. Furthermore, through the investigation of the resource cost and feasibility analysis, our protocol is simple and feasible under the current experimental conditions. All these suggest that it provides an alternative strategy for preparing large-scale atomic W-like states for perfect teleportation and superdense coding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation and linear differential equations more generally have provided promising exponential speed-ups over classical computers on a set of problems with high real-world interest. However, extending this to a nonlinear problem has proven challenging, with exponential lower bounds having been demonstrated for the time scaling. We provide a quantum algorithm matching these bounds. Specifically, we find that for a non-linear differential equation of the form $\frac{d|u\rangle}{dt} = A|u\rangle + B|u\rangle^{\otimes2}$ for evolution of time $T$, error tolerance $\epsilon$ and $c$ dependent on the strength of the nonlinearity, the number of queries to the differential operators that approaches the scaling of the quantum lower bound of $e^{o(T\|B\|)}$ queries in the limit of strong non-linearity. Finally, we introduce a classical algorithm based on the Euler method allowing comparably scaling to the quantum algorithm in a restricted case, as well as a randomized classical algorithm based on path integration that acts as a true analogue to the quantum algorithm in that it scales comparably to the quantum algorithm in cases where sign problems are absent.</description>

      <title>Scalable, high-fidelity all-electronic control of trapped-ion qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central challenge of quantum computing is implementing high-fidelity quantum gates at scale. However, many existing approaches to qubit control suffer from a scale-performance trade-off, impeding progress towards the creation of useful devices. Here, we present a vision for an electronically controlled trapped-ion quantum computer that alleviates this bottleneck. Our architecture utilizes shared current-carrying traces and local tuning electrodes in a microfabricated chip to perform quantum gates with low noise and crosstalk regardless of device size. To verify our approach, we experimentally demonstrate low-noise site-selective single- and two-qubit gates in a seven-zone ion trap that can control up to 10 qubits. We implement electronic single-qubit gates with 99.99916(7)% fidelity, and demonstrate consistent performance with low crosstalk across the device. We also electronically generate two-qubit maximally entangled states with 99.97(1)% fidelity and long-term stable performance over continuous system operation. These state-of-the-art results validate the path to directly scaling these techniques to large-scale quantum computers based on electronically controlled trapped-ion qubits.</description>

      <title>Revealing spontaneous symmetry breaking in continuous time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a pivotal role in physics ranging from the emergence of elementary particles to the phase transitions of matter. The spontaneous breaking of continuous time translation symmetry leads to a novel state of matter named continuous time crystal (CTC). It exhibits periodic oscillation without the need for periodic driving, and the relative phases for repetitively realized oscillations are random. However, the mechanism behind the spontaneous symmetry breaking in CTCs, particularly the random phases, remains elusive. Here we propose and experimentally realize two types of CTCs based on distinct mechanisms: manifold topology and near-chaotic motion. We observe both types of CTCs in thermal atomic ensembles by artificially synthesizing spin-spin nonlinear interactions through a measurement-feedback scheme. Our work provides general recipes for the realization of CTCs, and paves the way for exploring CTCs in various systems.</description>

      <title>On compatibility of binary qubit measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding which sets of quantum measurements allow a simultaneous readout is a central problem in quantum measurement theory. The problem is relevant not only from the foundational perspective but also has direct applications in quantum correlation problems fueled by incompatible measurements. Although central, only a few analytical criteria exist for deciding the incompatibility of general sets of measurements. This work approaches the problem through functions defined on the Boolean hypercube and their Fourier transformations. We show that this reformulation of the problem leads to a complete geometric characterisation of joint measurability of any finite set of unbiased binary qubit measurements and gives a necessary condition for the biased case. We discuss our results in the realm of quantum steering, where they translate into a family of steering inequalities. When certain unbiasedness conditions are fulfilled, these criteria are tight, hence fully characterizing the steering problem when the trusted party holds a qubit, and the untrusted party performs any finite number of binary measurements. We further discuss how our results point towards a second-order cone programming approach to measurement incompatibility and compare this to the predominantly used semi-definite programming-based techniques. We use our approach to falsify an existing conjecture on measurement incompatibility of special sets of measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kerr nonlinear oscillator (KNO) supports a pair of steady eigenstates, coherent states with opposite phases, that are good for the encoding of continuous variable qubit basis states. Arbitrary control of the KNO confined within the steady state subspace allows extraction of the Berry curvature through the linear response of the physical observable to the quench velocity of the system, providing an effective method for the characterization of topology in the KNO. As an alternative, the control adopting the "shortcut to adiabaticity" to the KNO enables the exploration of the topology through accelerated adiabatic eigenstate evolution to measure all three physical observables. Topological transitions are revealed by the jump of the first Chern number, obtained respectively from the integral of the Berry curvature and of the new polar angle relation, over the whole parameter space. Our strategy paves the way for measuring topological transitions in continuous variable systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian subject to stochastic perturbations in its anti-Hermitian part, describing fluctuating gains and losses. The master equation governing the noise-average dynamics describes a new form of dephasing. We characterize the resulting state evolution and analyze its purity. The novel properties of such dynamics are illustrated in a stochastic dissipative qubit. Our analytical results show that adding noise allows for a rich control of the dynamics, with a greater diversity of steady states and the possibility of state purification.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly} \log n $ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly} \log \log n $ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly} \log n$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing unitary ensembles conjectured to form PRUs. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</description>

      <title>Scalable improvement of the generalized Toffoli gate realization using trapped-ion-based qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient implementation of the Toffoli gate is of conceptual importance for running various quantum algorithms, including Grover's search and Shor's integer factorization. However, direct realizations of the Toffoli gate require either a prohibitive growth of the number of two-qubit gates or using ancilla qubits, whereas both of these resources are limited in the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here we experimentally demonstrate a scalable improvement of the realization of the Toffoli gate using $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ trapped-ion-based dual-type optic-microwave qutrits ($d=3$) for the cases of three-, four-qubit and five-qubit versions of the Toffoli gate. With the use of the Molmer-Sorensen gate as a basic two-particle operation, we compare the standard qubit decomposition with the qutrit approach, where upper levels are used as ancillas. The presented decomposition requires only global control of the ancilla levels, which simplifies experimental implementation of the proposed approach. We present an estimation of the scalable improvement of our approach in the case of multi-qubit gates. As we expect, by combining this approach with the leveraging qudits ($d\geq4$) as a set of qubits, our approach may lead to a more efficient realization of various quantum algorithms. With qutrit-based decomposition in Grover's search with three ions, we experimentally demonstrate the 10\% increase in the average algorithm performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new quantum embedding method to explore spin-phonon interactions in molecular magnets. This technique consolidates various spin/phonon couplings into a limited number of collective degrees of freedom, allowing for a fully quantum mechanical treatment. By precisely factorizing the entire system into "system" and "bath" sub-ensembles, our approach simplifies a previously intractable problem, making it solvable on modest-scale computers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by studying the spin relaxation and dephasing times of the single-molecule qubit \ce{VOPc(OH)8}, which features a lone unpaired electron on the central vanadium atom. By using this mode projection method, we are able to perform numerical exact quantum dynamical calculation on this system which allows us to follow the flow of quantum information from the single spin qubit into the projected phonon degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate both the utility of the method and suggest how one can engineer the environment as to further optimize the quantum properties of a qubit system.</description>

      <title>Optimal number of parametrized rotations and Hadamard gates in parametrized Clifford circuits with non-repeated parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm to reduce the number of non-Clifford gates in quantum circuits and the number of parametrized rotations in parametrized quantum circuits. The method consists in finding rotations that can be merged into a single rotation gate. This approach has already been considered before and is used as a pre-processing procedure in many optimization algorithms, notably for optimizing the number of Hadamard gates or the number of $T$ gates in Clifford$+T$ circuits. Our algorithm has a better complexity than similar methods and is particularly efficient for circuits with a low number of internal Hadamard gates. Furthermore, we show that this approach is optimal for parametrized circuits composed of Clifford gates and parametrized rotations with non-repeated parameters. For the same type of parametrized quantum circuits, we also prove that a previous procedure optimizing the number of Hadamard gates and internal Hadamard gates is optimal. This procedure is notably used in our low-complexity algorithm for optimally reducing the number of parametrized rotations.</description>

      <title>Approximate Unitary $k$-Designs from Shallow, Low-Communication Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random unitaries are useful in quantum information and related fields but hard to generate with limited resources. An approximate unitary $k$-design is an ensemble of unitaries and measure over which the average is close to a Haar (uniformly) random ensemble up to the first $k$ moments. A particularly strong notion of approximation bounds the distance from Haar randomness in relative error: the approximate design can be written as a convex combination involving an exact design and vice versa. We construct multiplicative-error approximate unitary $k$-design ensembles for which communication between subsystems is $O(1)$ in the system size. These constructions use the alternating projection method to analyze overlapping Haar twirls, giving a bound on the convergence speed to the full twirl with respect to the $2$-norm. Using the von Neumann subalgebra indices to replace system dimension, the 2-norm distance converts to relative error without introducing any additional dependence on system size. Via recursion on these constructions, we construct a scheme yielding relative error designs in $O \big ( (k \log k + \log m + \log(1/\epsilon) ) k\, \text{polylog}(k) \big )$ depth, where $m$ is the dimension of the complete system and $\epsilon$ the approximation error. This sublinear depth construction answers one variant of [Harrow and Mehraban 2023, Open Problem 1]. Moreover, entanglement generated by the sublinear depth scheme follows area laws on spatial lattices up to corrections logarithmic in the full system size.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics in decohered quantum memory with repeated syndrome measurements: a dual approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements can detect errors in a decohered quantum memory allowing active error correction to increase the memory time. Previous understanding of this mechanism has focused on evaluating the performance of error correction algorithms based on measurement results. In this work, we instead intrinsically characterize the information dynamics in a quantum memory under repeated measurements, using coherent information and relative entropy. We consider the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional stabilizer code subject to Pauli errors and noisy stabilizer measurements and develop a $(d+1)$-dimensional statistical mechanics model for the information-theoretic diagnostics. Our model is dual to the model previously obtained for the optimal decoding algorithm, and the potential decoding transition in the quantum memory again manifests as a thermal phase transition in the statistical mechanics model. We explicitly derive the model and study the phase transition in information encoding in three examples: surface codes, repetition codes, and the XZZX code.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm to Prepare Quasi-Stationary States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics can be analyzed via the structure of energy eigenstates. However, in the many-body setting, preparing eigenstates associated with finite temperatures requires time scaling exponentially with system size. In this work we present an efficient quantum search algorithm which produces quasi-stationary states, having energies supported within narrow windows of a dense many-body spectrum. In time scaling polynomially with system size, the algorithm produces states with inverse polynomial energy width, which can in turn be used to analyze many-body dynamics out to polynomial times. The algorithm is based on quantum singular value transformations and quantum signal processing, and provides a quadratic speedup over measurement-based approaches. We discuss how this algorithm can be used as a primitive to investigate the mechanisms underlying thermalization and hydrodynamics in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identity of quantum matter can be effectively altered by means of gauge fields. In two spatial dimensions this is illustrated by the Chern-Simons flux-attachment mechanism, but such a mechanism is not possible in lower dimensions. Here, we study a one-dimensional interacting Bose gas in the presence of a gauge field. This model can be explicitly mapped into an interacting anyonic system by a large gauge transformation, indicating a statistical transmutation analogous to that of Chern-Simons. The Bogoliubov spectrum in the weakly-interacting limit reveals the presence of a roton minimum arising from the statistical interaction. At a mean-field level chiral solitons are recovered. Should these be understood as quantum bound states, it is natural to interpret them as corresponding to localised anyonic quasiparticles. Hydrodynamic arguments highlight the presence of dispersive chiral shock waves in the propagation of a wavepacket due to a Riemann-Hopf nonlinearity. Numerical calculations show the presence of both chiral soliton trains and shock waves.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Analysis of Molecular Quantum (MolQ) Communication Channel in the Gut-Brain Axis Synapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gut-brain axis is the communication link between the gut and the brain. Although it is known that the gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in homeostasis, its overall mechanism is still not known. However, for neural synapses, classical molecular communication is described by the formation of ligand-receptor complexes, which leads to the opening of ion channels. Moreover, there are some conditions that need to be fulfilled before the opening of the ion channel. In this study, we will consider the gut-brain axis, where neurotransmitters diffuse through the synaptic cleft, considering molecular communication. On the vagus nerve (VN) membrane, i.e., the post-synaptic membrane of the synapse, it undergoes a quantum communication (QC), which initiates the opening of the ion channel, thus initiating the communication signal from the gut to the brain. It evolves a new paradigm of communication approach, Molecular Quantum (MolQ) communication. Based on the QC model, we theoretically analyzes the output states, and QC is simulated considering the incoming neurotransmitter's concentration and validated by analyzing the entropy and the mutual information of the input, i.e., neurotransmitter's concentration, and output, i.e., ion channel opening.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Spin Metrology with Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.</description>

      <title>Atom interferometry in an Einstein Elevator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in atom interferometry have led to the development of quantum inertial sensors with outstanding performance in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, and long-term stability. For ground-based implementations, these sensors are ultimately limited by the free-fall height of atomic fountains required to interrogate the atoms over extended timescales. This limitation can be overcome in Space and in unique ``microgravity'' facilities such as drop towers or free-falling aircraft. These facilities require large investments, long development times, and place stringent constraints on instruments that further limit their widespread use. The available ``up time'' for experiments is also quite low, making extended studies challenging. In this work, we present a new approach in which atom interferometry is performed in a laboratory-scale Einstein Elevator. Our experiment is mounted to a moving platform that mimics the vertical free-fall trajectory every 13.5 seconds. With a total interrogation time of $2T = 200$ ms, we demonstrate an acceleration sensitivity of $6 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^{2}$ per shot, limited primarily by the temperature of our atomic samples. We further demonstrate the capability to perform long-term statistical studies by operating the Einstein Elevator over several days with high reproducibility. These represent state-of-the-art results achieved in microgravity and further demonstrates the potential of quantum inertial sensors in Space. Our microgravity platform is both an alternative to large atomic fountains and a versatile facility to prepare future Space missions.</description>

      <title>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Machine Learning Performance in a Hybrid Quantum Computing and HPC Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored the possible benefits of integrating quantum simulators in a "hybrid" quantum machine learning (QML) workflow that uses both classical and quantum computations in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. Here, we used two Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility HPC systems, Andes (a commodity-type Linux cluster) and Frontier (an HPE Cray EX supercomputer), along with quantum computing simulators from PennyLane and IBMQ to evaluate a hybrid QML program -- using a "ground up" approach. Using 1 GPU on Frontier, we found ~56% and ~77% speedups when compared to using Frontier's CPU and a local, non-HPC system, respectively. Analyzing performance on a larger dataset using multiple threads, the Frontier GPUs performed ~92% and ~48% faster than the Andes and Frontier CPUs, respectively. More impressively, this is a ~226% speedup over a local, non-HPC system's runtime using the same simulator and number of threads. We hope that this proof of concept will motivate more intensive hybrid QC/HPC scaling studies in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum Triticality of Bosonic Atomic-Molecular Mixtures with Feshbach Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a functional integral formulation for a homogeneous bosonic atomic-molecular mixture with Feshbach coupling in three-spatial dimensions. Taking phase stability into account, we establish a rich ground-state phase diagram, which features three regions: molecular superfluid (MSF), atomic-molecular superfluid (AMSF), and phase separation (PS). The system can accommodate up to two tricritical points where the three regions meet, with one tricritical point being intrinsic and the other being conditional. Strikingly, we show that the sound velocity vanishes as the AMSF phase touches on the border of phase separation lines. We find that quantum fluctuations correction to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion of the condensates vary nonmonotonically with Feshbach coupling strength as well as molecular percentage. Correlation functions such as pairing amplitudes, density structure factor and spin density structure factor show characteristic behaviors when the system crosses phase transitions. Our work paves the way for future advancement toward understanding salient physics of atom-molecular mixtures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Technology masters: A shortcut to the quantum industry?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a growing trend in the worldwide Quantum Technology (QT) education landscape, that of the development of masters programs, intended to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills to take a job in the quantum industry, while serving a much shorter timeline than a doctoral degree. Through a global survey, we identified 86 masters programs, with substantial growth since 2021. Over time masters have become increasingly interdisciplinary, organised by multiple faculties or through joint degree programs, and offer more hands-on experiences such as internships in companies. Information from program organisers and websites suggests that the intended career destinations of their graduates are a diverse range of industries, and therefore masters programs may be a boon to the industrialisation of quantum technologies. Finally, we identify a range of national efforts to grow the quantum workforce of many countries, quantum program enhancements, which augment the content of existing study programs with quantum content. This may further contribute to the growth and viability of masters programs as a route to the quantum industry.</description>

Abstract: We consider bosons with weak contact interactions in a harmonic trap and focus on states at the lowest Landau level. Motivated by the known nontrivial phase-space topography of the energy functional of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we explore Husimi densities of quantum energy eigenstates in the classical phase space of the Schroedinger field. With interactions turned off, the energy levels are highly degenerate and the Husimi densities do not manifest any particular localization properties. With interactions turned on, the degeneracy is lifted, and a selection of energy levels emerges whose Husimi densities are localized around low-dimensional surfaces in the phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the N-partite coherences of GHZ and W states for free bosonic and fermionic fields when any n observers hover near the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. We derive the more general analytical expressions for N-partite coherence, encompassing both physically accessible and inaccessible coherences in the context of the dilaton black hole. It has been found that the coherence of the bosonic field is greater than that of the fermionic field, while the entanglement of the fermionic field is greater than that of the bosonic field in dilaton spacetime. Additionally, the coherence of the W state is greater than that of the GHZ state, whereas the entanglement of the GHZ state is greater than that of the W state in curved spacetime. These results suggest that we should utilize suitable quantum resources and different types of particles for relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a massless scalar field in de Sitter space depends on multiple scales, such as the radius of the entangling surface, the Hubble constant and the UV cutoff. We perform a high-precision numerical calculation using a lattice model in order to determine the dependence on these scales in the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We derive the leading de Sitter corrections to the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We analyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the contribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with vanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which extends beyond the horizon.</description>

Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a free field in de Sitter space is enhanced by the squeezing of its modes. We show analytically that the expansion induces a term in the entanglement entropy that depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which may extend beyond the horizon. In cosmology the size of the system can be identified with the size of a spatially finite universe, or with the wavelength of the first mode that exited the horizon in the beginning of inflation.</description>

Abstract: A quantum measurement scheme is suggested in two resonant models of quantum electrodynamics. The first model is the brain, where, for the propagation of its action potentials, the free electron laser-like coherence mechanism recently investigated by the author is comprehensively applied. The second model is an assembly of Preparata et al.'s coherence domains, in which we incorporate the quantum field theory of memory advocated by Umezawa et al. These two models are remarkably analogous.</description>

Abstract: Subnatural-linewidth single photons are ofvital importance in quantum optics and quantum information science. According to previous research, it appears difficult to utilize resonance fluorescence to generate single photons with subnatural linewidth. Here we propose a universally applicable approach to generate fluorescent single photons with subnatural linewidth, which can be implemented based on {\Lambda}-shape and similar energy structures. Further, the general condition to obtain fluorescent single photons with subnatural linewidth is revealed. The single-photon linewidth can be easily manipulated over a broad range by external fields, which can be several orders ofmagnitude smaller than the natural linewidth. Our study can be easily implemented in various physical platforms with current experimental techniques and will significantly facilitate the research on the quantum nature of resonance fluorescence and the technologies in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Study of noise in virtual distillation circuits for quantum error mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual distillation has been proposed as an error mitigation protocol for estimating the expectation values of observables in quantum algorithms. It proceeds by creating a cyclic permutation of $M$ noisy copies of a quantum state using a sequence of controlled-swap gates. If the noise does not shift the dominant eigenvector of the density operator away from the ideal state, then the error in expectation-value estimation can be exponentially reduced with $M$. In practice, subsequent error mitigation techniques are required to suppress the effect of noise in the cyclic permutation circuit itself, leading to increased experimental complexity. Here, we perform a careful analysis of the effect of uncorrelated, identical noise in the cyclic permutation circuit and find that the estimation of expectation value of observables are robust against dephasing noise. We support the analytical result with numerical simulations and find that $67\%$ of errors are reduced for $M=2$, with physical dephasing error probabilities as high as $10\%$. Our results imply that a broad class of quantum algorithms can be implemented with higher accuracy in the near-term with qubit platforms where non-dephasing errors are suppressed, such as superconducting bosonic qubits and Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Thermal masses and trapped-ion quantum spin models: a self-consistent approach to Yukawa-type interactions in the $\lambda\!\phi^4$ model</title>

Abstract: The quantum simulation of magnetism in trapped-ion systems makes use of the crystal vibrations to mediate pairwise interactions between spins, which are encoded in the internal electronic states of the ions, and measured in experiments that probe the real-time dynamics. These interactions can be accounted for by a long-wavelength relativistic theory, where the phonons are described by a coarse-grained Klein-Gordon field $\phi(x)$ locally coupled to the spins that acts as a carrier, leading to an analogue of pion-mediated Yukawa interactions. In the vicinity of a structural transition of the ion crystal, one must go beyond the Klein-Gordon fields, and include additional $\lambda\phi^4$ terms responsible for phonon-phonon scattering. This leads to quantum effects that can be expressed by Feynman loop integrals that modify the range of the Yukawa-type spin interactions; an effect that could be used to probe the underlying fixed point of this quantum field theory (QFT). Unfortunately, the rigidity of the trapped-ion crystal makes it challenging to observe genuine quantum effects, such as the flow of the critical point with the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We hereby show that thermal effects, which can be controlled by laser cooling, can unveil this flow through the appearance of thermal masses in interacting QFTs. We perform self-consistent calculations that resum certain Feynman diagrams and, additionally, go beyond mean-field theory to predict how measurements on the trapped-ion spin system can probe key properties of the $\lambda\phi^4$ QFT.</description>

Abstract: Quantum errors in noisy environments remain a major obstacle to advancing quantum information technology. In this work, we expand a recently developed geometric framework, originally utilized for analyzing noise accumulation and creating dynamical error-correcting gates at the control pulse level, to now study noise dynamics at the quantum circuit level. Through a geometric perspective, we demonstrate how circuit noise robustness can be enhanced using twirling techniques. Additionally, we show that circuits modified by random twirling correspond to random walk trajectories in this geometric framework, and provide a fresh perspective on randomized compiling by analytically deriving the perturbative expression for the resultant Pauli noise channel. We also illustrate that combining robustness optimization strategies at both the control pulse and circuit levels can significantly boost overall circuit fidelity even further through numerical examples. This research illuminates pathways to achieving noise-resistant quantum control beyond mere optimization of control pulses.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</title>

Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model describes the coupling of a two-state system to a bosonic field mode. Recent theoretical work has pointed out that a generalized periodic version of this model, which maps onto Hamiltonians applicable in superconducting qubit settings, can be quantum simulated with cold trapped atoms. Here, we experimentally demonstrate atomic dynamics predicted by the periodic quantum Rabi model far in the deep strong coupling regime. The two-state system is represented by two Bloch bands of cold atoms in an optical lattice, and the bosonic mode by oscillations in a superimposed optical dipole trap potential. The observed dynamics beyond the usual quantum Rabi physics becomes relevant when the edge of the Brillouin zone is reached, and evidence for collapse and revival of the initial state is revealed at extreme coupling conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the experimental measurement, on a quantum processor, of a series of polynomial lower bounds that converge to the quantum Fisher information (QFI), a fundamental quantity for certifying multipartite entanglement that is useful for metrological applications. We combine advanced methods of the randomized measurement toolbox to obtain estimators that are robust against drifting errors caused uniquely during the randomized measurement protocol. We estimate the QFI for Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger states, observing genuine multipartite entanglement. Then, we prepare the ground state of the transverse field Ising model at the critical point using a variational circuit. We estimate its QFI and investigate the interplay between state optimization and noise induced by increasing the circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Reducing the number of qubits in quantum simulations of one dimensional many-body Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Ising and Heisenberg models using the Block Renormalization Group Method (BRGM), focusing on its behavior across different system sizes. The BRGM reduces the number of spins by a factor of 1/2 (1/3) for the Ising (Heisenberg) model, effectively preserving essential physical features of the model while using only a fraction of the spins. Through a comparative analysis, we demonstrate that as the system size increases, there is an exponential convergence between results obtained from the original and renormalized Ising Hamiltonians, provided the coupling constants are redefined accordingly. Remarkably, for a spin chain with 24 spins, all physical features, including magnetization, correlation function, and entanglement entropy, exhibit an exact correspondence with the results from the original Hamiltonian. The study of the Heisenberg model also shows this tendency, although complete convergence may appear for a size much larger than 24 spins, and is therefore beyond our computational capabilities. The success of BRGM in accurately characterizing the Ising model, even with a relatively small number of spins, underscores its robustness and utility in studying complex physical systems, and facilitates its simulation on current NISQ computers, where the available number of qubits is largely constrained.</description>

      <title>In situ subwavelength microscopy of ultracold atoms using dressed excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we implement a new method for imaging ultracold atoms with subwavelength resolution capabilities and determine its regime of validity. It uses the laser driven interaction between excited states to engineer hyperfine ground state population transfer in a three-level system on scales much smaller than the optical resolution. Subwavelength imaging of a quantum gas is atypical in the sense that the measurement itself perturbs the dynamics of the system. To avoid induced dynamics affecting the measurement, one usually measures "rapidly" the wavefunction in a so-called strong imaging regime. We experimentally illustrate this regime using a thermal gas ensemble, and demonstrate subwavelength resolution in quantitative agreement with a fully analytical model. Additionally, we show that, counter-intuitively, the opposite weak imaging regime can also be exploited to reach subwavelength resolution. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that this regime is a robust solution to select and spatially resolve a 30 nm wide wavefunction, which was created and singled out from a tightly confined 1D optical lattice. Using a general dissipation-included formalism, we derive validity criteria for both regimes. The formalism is applicable to other subwavelength methods.</description>

Abstract: Matter-wave interferometers with micro-particles will enable the next generation of quantum sensors to probe minute quantum phase information. Therefore, estimating the loss of coherence and the degree of entanglement degradation for such interferometers is essential. In this paper, we will provide a noise analysis in frequency-space focusing on electromagnetic sources of dephasing. We will assume that our matter-wave interferometer has a residual charge or dipole which can interact with a neighbouring particle in the ambience. We will investigate the dephasing due to the Coulomb, charge-induced dipole, charge-permanent dipole, and dipole-dipole interactions. All these interactions constitute electromagnetically driven dephasing channels that can affect single or multiple interferometers. As an example, we will apply the obtained formulae to situations with two adjacent micro-particles, which can provide insight for the noise analysis in the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol and the C-NOT gate: we will compute the dephasing due to a gas of environmental particles interacting via dipole-dipole and charge-charge couplings, respectively. To obtain simple analytical dephasing formulae, we will employ uniform probability distributions for the impact parameter and for the angles characterizing the relative orientation with respect to the interferometer and a Gaussian distribution for the velocities of the environmental particles. In both cases, we will show that the dephasing rate grows with the number density of particles present in the vacuum chamber, as expected.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Machine Learning With Continuous Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The popular qubit framework has dominated recent work on quantum kernel machine learning, with results characterising expressivity, learnability and generalisation. As yet, there is no comparative framework to understand these concepts for continuous variable (CV) quantum computing platforms. In this paper we represent CV quantum kernels as closed form functions and use this representation to provide several important theoretical insights. We derive a general closed form solution for all CV quantum kernels and show every such kernel can be expressed as the product of a Gaussian and an algebraic function of the parameters of the feature map. Furthermore, in the multi-mode case, we present quantification of a quantum-classical separation for all quantum kernels via a hierarchical notion of the "stellar rank" of the quantum kernel feature map. We then prove kernels defined by feature maps of infinite stellar rank, such as GKP-state encodings, can be approximated arbitrarily well by kernels defined by feature maps of finite stellar rank. Finally, we simulate learning with a single-mode displaced Fock state encoding and show that (i) accuracy on our specific task (an annular data set) increases with stellar rank, (ii) for underfit models, accuracy can be improved by increasing a bandwidth hyperparameter, and (iii) for noisy data that is overfit, decreasing the bandwidth will improve generalisation but does so at the cost of effective stellar rank.</description>

Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic operations are based on nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric phases, hence possessing the inherent geometric features for robustness against control errors. However, nonadiabatic holonomic operations are still sensitive to the systematic amplitude error induced by imperfect control of pulse timing or laser intensity. In this work, we present a scheme of nonadiabatic holonomic operations in order to mitigate the said systematic amplitude error. This is achieved by introducing a monitor qubit along with a conditional measurement on the monitor qubit that serves as an error correction device. We shall show how to filter out the undesired effect of the systematic amplitude error, thereby improving the performance of nonadiabatic holonomic operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a general microscopic model for a quantum measuring apparatus comprising a quantum probe coupled to a thermal bath, we analyze the energetic resources necessary for the realization of a quantum measurement, which includes the creation of system-apparatus correlations, the irreversible transition to a statistical mixture of definite outcomes, and the apparatus resetting. Crucially, we do not resort to another quantum measurement to capture the emergence of objective measurement results, but rather exploit the properties of the thermal bath which redundantly records the measurement result in its degrees of freedom, naturally implementing the paradigm of quantum Darwinism. In practice, this model allows us to perform a quantitative thermodynamic analysis for the measurement process. From the expression of the second law, we show how the minimal required work depends on the energy variation of the system being measured plus information-theoretic quantities characterizing the performance of the measurement -- efficiency and completeness. Additionally, we show that it is possible to perform a thermodynamically reversible measurement, thus reaching the minimal work expenditure, and provide the corresponding protocol. Finally, for finite-time measurement protocols, we illustrate the increasing work cost induced by rising entropy production inherent of finite-time thermodynamic processes. This highlights an emerging trade-off between velocity of the measurement and work cost, on top of a trade-off between efficiency of the measurement and work cost.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body quantum systems using Rydberg-atom platforms has become of extreme interest in the last years. The possibility to realize spin Hamiltonians and the accurate control at the single atom level paved the way for the study of quantum phases of matter and dynamics. Here, we propose a quantum optimal control protocol to engineer current states: quantum states characterized by Rydberg excitations propagating in a given spatially closed tweezer networks. Indeed, current states with different winding numbers can be generated on demand. Besides those ones with single winding number, superposition of quantum current states characterized by more winding numbers can be obtained. The single current states are eigenstates of the current operator that therefore can define an observable that remains persistent at any time. In particular, the features of the excitations dynamics reflects the nature of current states, a fact that in principle can be used to characterize the nature of the flow experimentally without the need of accessing high order correlators.</description>

Abstract: Nash equilibrium is employed to find a game theoretic robust security bound on quantum bit error rate (QBER) for DL04 protocol which is a scheme for quantum secure direct communication that has been experimentally realized recently. The receiver, sender and eavesdropper (Eve) are considered to be quantum players (players having the capability to perform quantum operations). Specifically, Eve is considered to have the capability of performing quantum attacks (e.g., W\'ojcik's original attack, W\'ojcik's symmetrized attack and Pavi\v{c}i\'c attack) and classical intercept and resend attack. Game theoretic analysis of the security of DL04 protocol in the above scenario is performed by considering several game scenarios. The analysis revealed the absence of a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point within these game scenarios. Consequently, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium points are identified and employed to establish both upper and lower bounds for QBER. Further, the vulnerability of the DL04 protocol to Pavi\v{c}i\'c attack in the message mode is established. In addition, it is observed that the quantum attacks performed by Eve are more powerful than the classical attack, as the QBER value and the probability of detecting Eve's presence are found to be lower in quantum attacks compared to classical ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate strategies for the deterministic creation of trains of time-bin entangled photons using an individual quantum emitter described by a $\Lambda$-type electronic system. We explicitly demonstrate the theoretical generation of linear cluster states with substantial numbers of entangled photonic qubits in full microscopic numerical simulations. The underlying scheme is based on the manipulation of ground state coherences through precise optical driving. One important finding is that the most easily accessible quality metrics, the achievable rotation fidelities, fall short in assessing the actual quantum correlations of the emitted photons in the face of losses. To address this, we explicitly calculate stabilizer generator expectation values as a superior gauge for the quantum properties of the generated many-photon state. With widespread applicability also to other emitter and excitation-emission schemes, our work lays the conceptual foundations for an in-depth practical analysis of time-bin entanglement based on full numerical simulations with predictive capabilities for realistic systems and setups including losses and imperfections. The specific results shown in the present work illustrate that with controlled minimization of losses and realistic system parameters for quantum-dot type systems, useful linear cluster states of significant lengths can be generated in the calculations, discussing the possibility of scalability for quantum information processing endeavors.</description>

Abstract: We delve into the use of photonic quantum computing to simulate quantum mechanics and extend its application towards quantum field theory. We develop and prove a method that leverages this form of Continuous-Variable Quantum Computing (CVQC) to reproduce the time evolution of quantum-mechanical states under arbitrary Hamiltonians, and we demonstrate the method's remarkable efficacy with various potentials. Our method centres on constructing an evolver-state, a specially prepared quantum state that induces the desired time-evolution on the target state. This is achieved by introducing a non-Gaussian operation using a measurement-based quantum computing approach, enhanced by machine learning. Furthermore, we propose a framework in which these methods can be extended to encode field theories in CVQC without discretising the field values, thus preserving the continuous nature of the fields. This opens new avenues for quantum computing applications in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Many-hypercube codes: High-rate quantum error-correcting codes for high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard approaches to quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computing are based on encoding a single logical qubit into many physical ones, resulting in asymptotically zero encoding rates and therefore huge resource overheads. To overcome this issue, high-rate quantum codes, such as quantum low-density parity-check codes, have been studied over the past decade. In this case, however, it is difficult to perform logical gates in parallel while maintaining low overheads. Here we propose concatenated high-rate small-size quantum error-detecting codes as a new family of high-rate quantum codes. Their simple structure allows for a geometrical interpretation using hypercubes corresponding to logical qubits. We thus call them many-hypercube codes. They can realize both high rates, e.g., 30% (64 logical qubits are encoded into 216 physical ones), and parallelizability of logical gates. Developing dedicated decoder and encoders, we achieve high error thresholds even in a circuit-level noise model. Thus, the many-hypercube codes will pave the way to high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Stochastic correction to the Maxwell-Bloch equations via the positive $P$ representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on two-level atoms, we apply the positive $P$ representation to a full-wave mixed bosonic and fermionic system of Jaynes-Cummings type and identify an advantageous degree of freedom in the choice of the involved nonorthogonal fermionic basis states. On this basis, we propose a stochastic correction to the Maxwell-Bloch equations by relating them to a stochastic differential equation on a nonclassical phase space, which captures the full second quantization dynamics of the system. This approach explores the connection between semiclassical and field-quantized treatments of light-matter interaction and can potentially be used for the simulation of nonclassical light sources while retaining the main advantages of a semiclassical model.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking digital quantum simulations above hundreds of qubits using quantum critical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this manuscript, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to benchmark quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques on up to 133 qubits. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse field Ising Hamiltonian. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows reliable control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as Hamiltonian simulation, variational algorithms, optimization, or quantum machine learning. We demonstrate this on the example of digitized quantum annealing for optimization and identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step on a 133-site optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Circuit-based leakage-to-erasure conversion in a neutral atom quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leakage out of the computational subspace is a major limitation of current state-of-the-art neutral-atom quantum computers and a significant challenge for scalable systems. In a quantum processor with cesium atoms, we demonstrate proof-of-principle circuit-based conversion of leakage errors to erasure errors via Leakage Detection Units (LDUs), which non-destructively map information about the presence or absence of the qubit onto the state of an ancilla. With a standard LDU circuit, we successfully convert leakage errors to erasure errors for all major leakage pathways while preserving the quantum information in the case that no leakage occurred. We benchmark the performance of the LDU using a three-outcome low-loss state detection method and also explore the advantages of three-outcome measurements for LDUs. We find that the LDU detects atom-loss errors with ~93.4% accuracy, limited by technical imperfections of our apparatus. We further compile and execute a SWAP LDU, wherein the roles of the original data atom and ancilla atom are exchanged under the action of the LDU, providing 'free refilling' of atoms in the case of leakage errors. This circuit-based leakage-to-erasure error conversion is a critical component of a neutral-atom quantum processor where the quantum information may significantly outlive the lifetime of any individual atom in the quantum register.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering Criterion and Monogamy Relation via Correlation Matrices in Tripartite Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum steering is considered as one of the most well-known nonlocal phenomena in quantum mechanics. Unlike entanglement and Bell non-locality, the asymmetry of quantum steering makes it vital for one-sided device-independent quantum information processing. Although there has been much progress on steering detection for bipartite systems, the criterion for EPR steering in tripartite systems remains challenging and inadequate. In this paper, we firstly derive a novel and promising steering criterion for any three-qubit states via correlation matrix. Furthermore, we propose the monogamy relation between the tripartite steering of system and the bipartite steering of subsystems based on the derived criterion. Finally, as illustrations, we demonstrate the performance of the steering criterion and the monogamy relation by means of several representative examples. We believe that the results and methods presented in this work could be beneficial to capture genuine multipartite steering in the near future.</description>

      <title>Constrained Measurement Incompatibility from Generalised Contextuality of Steered Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a bipartite Bell scenario involving two local measurements per party and two outcome per measurement, the measurement incompatibility in one wing is both necessary and sufficient to reveal the nonlocality. However, such a one-to-one correspondence fails when one of the observers performs more than two measurements. In such a scenario, the measurement incompatibility is necessary but not sufficient to reveal the nonlocality. In this work, within the formalism of general probabilistic theory (GPT), we demonstrate that unlike the nonlocality, the incompatibility of N arbitrary measurements in one wing is both necessary and sufficient for revealing the generalised contextuality for the sub-system in the other wing. Further, we formulate a novel form of inequality for any GPT that are necessary for N-wise compatibility of N arbitrary observables. Moreover, we argue that any theory that violates the proposed inequality possess a degree of incompatibility that can be quantified through the amount of violation. Finally, we claim that it is the generalised contextuality that provides a restriction to the allowed degree of measurement incompatibility of any viable theory of nature and thereby super-select the the quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MindSpore Quantum, a pioneering hybrid quantum-classical framework with a primary focus on the design and implementation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms. Leveraging the robust support of MindSpore, an advanced open-source deep learning training/inference framework, MindSpore Quantum exhibits exceptional efficiency in the design and training of variational quantum algorithms on both CPU and GPU platforms, delivering remarkable performance. Furthermore, this framework places a strong emphasis on enhancing the operational efficiency of quantum algorithms when executed on real quantum hardware. This encompasses the development of algorithms for quantum circuit compilation and qubit mapping, crucial components for achieving optimal performance on quantum processors. In addition to the core framework, we introduce QuPack, a meticulously crafted quantum computing acceleration engine. QuPack significantly accelerates the simulation speed of MindSpore Quantum, particularly in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), and tensor network simulations, providing astonishing speed. This combination of cutting-edge technologies empowers researchers and practitioners to explore the frontiers of quantum computing with unprecedented efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete solution to the problem of infinite quantum signal processing for the class of Szeg\H{o} functions, which are functions that satisfy a logarithmic integrability condition and include almost any function that allows for a quantum signal processing representation. We do so by introducing a new algorithm called the Riemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm, which can compute any individual phase factor independent of all other phase factors. Our algorithm is also the first provably stable numerical algorithm for computing phase factors of any arbitrary Szeg\H{o} function. The proof of stability involves solving a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem in nonlinear Fourier analysis using elements of spectral theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadamard diagonalizable graphs are undirected graphs for which the corresponding Laplacian is diagonalizable by a Hadamard matrix. Such graphs have been studied in the context of quantum state transfer. Recently, the concept of a weak Hadamard matrix was introduced: a $\{-1,0, 1\}$-matrix $P$ such that $PP^T$ is tridiagonal, as well as the concept of weakly Hadamard diagonalizable graphs. We therefore naturally explore quantum state transfer in these generalized Hadamards. Given the infancy of the topic, we provide numerous properties and constructions of weak Hadamard matrices and weakly Hadamard diagonalizable graphs in order to better understand them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study holographic entropy inequalities and their structural properties by making use of a judicious grouping of terms into certain multipartite information quantities. This allows us to recast cumbersome entropic expressions into much simpler ones which share interestingly rigid structures. By performing a systematic search over some of these structures, we are able to discover more than 300 novel entropy inequalities for six parties, thereby demonstrating that these recastings provide a fruitful generating technique for uncovering new holographic entropy inequalities. In attempting to interpret the corresponding sign-definite quantities as correlation measures, we also obtain a no-go result: the superbalance property of holographic entropy inequalities turns out to preclude them from being monotonic under partial tracing. In the process, we also comment on the geometrical significance of multipartite information quantities and present various structural relations amongst them.</description>

      <title>Quantum phases of hardcore bosons with repulsive dipolar density-density interactions on two-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons interacting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described by the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The ground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the long-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin mean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This extended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range density-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different lattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero hopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped) phases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust with respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes, these gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases, which can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At sufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of phases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square and triangular lattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations of self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators, e.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gate-defined quantum dots define an attractive platform for quantum computation and have been used to confine individual charges in a planar array. Here, we demonstrate control over vertical double quantum dots confined in a double quantum well, silicon-germanium heterostructure. We sense individual charge transitions with a single-hole transistor. The vertical separation between the quantum wells provides a sufficient difference in capacitive coupling to distinguish quantum dots located in the top and bottom quantum well. Tuning the vertical double quantum dot to the (1,1) charge state confines a single hole in each quantum well beneath a single plunger gate. By simultaneously accumulating holes under two neighbouring plunger gates, we are able to tune to the (1,1,1,1) charge state. These results motivate quantum dot systems that exploit the third dimension, opening new opportunities for quantum simulation and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we found that AFM coupling appears at the YIG/Py interface of the tetrahedral YIG surface formed with ion milling. The STEM measurements suggest that the interfacial AFM coupling is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange coupling mechanism, which is confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to be energetically favorable. Thus, the combined experimental and theoretical results reveal the critical role of interfacial atomic structure in determining the type magnetic coupling in a YIG/ferromagnet heterostructure, and prove that the interfacial structure can be experimentally tuned by surface ion-milling.</description>

Abstract: An Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector falling radially into a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, coupled linearly to a massless scalar field that has been prepared in the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh state, has recently been shown to exhibit a local extremum in its transition probability near the black hole horizon [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. We show that a similar phenomenon is present in the transition rate of a UDW detector falling radially into a spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, with the scalar field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking state. We give extensive numerical results as a function of the detector's energy gap, the black hole's mass, and the detector's drop-off radius. Our results suggest that the effect is robust, motivating a search for a similar effect in other black hole spacetimes, and calling for an explanation of the physical origin of the effect.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation and entropy bound in de Sitter spacetime</title>

Abstract: We analyze the entropy behavior of the de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. A cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime that constrains the causally accessible region of an observer exhibits thermal properties analogous to the event horizon of a black hole. According to the principles of holography, the entropy within a causally connected region for an observer is limited by its boundary. This entropy bound is violated during the late inflation stage. To address the issue of entropy bound violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopted a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. We consider Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the inflaton field, which shows the same behavior as the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-size region in stochastic inflation. Adopting the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we show a meaningful entropy behavior in the de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Learning local equivariant representations for quantum operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for understanding material properties. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design, constructing local, equivariant representations for quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependence without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution technique, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</description>
