      <title>Lines of Bound States in the Continuum in a Phononic Crystal Slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that bound states in the continuum (BICs) form continuous lines along high-symmetry directions of momentum space in a simple phononic crystal slab. Contrary to common sense, these BICs are symmetry-protected (SP) BICs not only at the center of the Brillouin zone (gamma point) but also off the gamma point. We utilize numerical simulations, a group theory method, and a mode expansion method to comprehensively understand the formation of the BICs. It is revealed that these BICs correspond to phase singularity lines of far-field radiation, and the phase winding number can be defined as a topological index. This makes the BICs topologically protected and robust to any parameter variation that maintains periodicity and rotational symmetry. Finally, the generation of the BICs lines is experimentally demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Recent development of magnetocaloric effect in Pyrochlore oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, solid state magnetic cooling based on magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have drawn attention worldwide as a promising alternative potential candidate to the conventional gas compression-expansion cooling technique. In this chapter, the current developments of MCE in pyrochlore oxide materials is presented. The interaction between magnetic frustration, strong spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations and crystal electric field lead to various complex magnetic states in pyrochlore oxides gives a broad template to explore these materials in MCE point of view. Pyrochlore oxides show strong frustration due to its crystal structure. Thus, the study of MCE in pyrochlore oxides could be fascinating not only from the an applications point of view but as well as from fundamental point of view. Among all the compounds, cubic pyrochlore oxide ErMnO exhibit largest conventional MCE value at change of field 5 T. On the other hand, YIrCrO series show coexistence of conventional MCE and inverse MCE which is absent in whole reported family of pyrochlore oxides. It is worth mention that depending on synthesis condition A2Mn2O7 series crystallizes in either cubic pyrochlore phase (Fd-3m) or monoclinic layered perovskite (P2M). It suggests the need of more materials to be explore experimentally and theoretically to establish the connection between these two phases.</description>

      <title>Growth mechanisms of GaN/GaAs nanostructures by droplet epitaxy explained by complementary experiments and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present conception and study of gallium nitride (GaN) nanostructures on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate with (111)A orientation. The nanostructures were designed by GaN droplet epitaxy and studied in-situ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ex-situ by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These studies were coupled with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to precisely understand the phenomena occurring during the nitridation and to find the optimum conditions for complete nitridation of gallium droplets. The HRTEM observation showed a cubic (zinc blende) crystal structure of the GaN nanodots for a nitridation at 300{\deg}C. Ramping the temperature from 100{\deg}C to 350{\deg}C during droplet nitridation enabled to obtain a very high density (&gt;1011cm-2) of GaN nanodots with the zinc blende crystallinity.</description>

      <title>A single-phase epitaxially grown ferroelectric perovskite nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectrics with semiconductors is crucial for developing functional devices, such as field-effect transistors, tunnel junctions, and nonvolatile memories. However, the synthesis of high-quality single-crystalline ferroelectric nitride perovskites has been limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their switching dynamics and potential applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterizations of epitaxial single-phase ferroelectric cerium tantalum nitride (CeTaN3) on both oxides and semiconductors. The polar symmetry of CeTaN3 was confirmed by observing the atomic displacement of central ions relative to the center of the TaN6 octahedra, as well as through optical second harmonic generation. We observed switchable ferroelectric domains in CeTaN3 films using piezo-response force microscopy, complemented by the characterization of square-like polarization-electric field hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization of CeTaN3 reaches approximately 20 uC/cm2 at room temperature, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work establishes a vital link between ferroelectric nitride perovskites and their practical applications, paving the way for next-generation information and energy-storage devices with enhanced performance, scalability, and manufacturability.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of Binary Nanocrystal Superlattices and the Relevance of Short-Range Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of binary nanocrystal superlattices (BNSLs) enables the targeted integration of orthogonal physical properties, like photoluminescence and magnetism, into a single superstructure, unlocking a vast design space for multifunctional materials. Yet, the formation mechanism of BNSLs remains poorly understood, restricting the use of simulation to predict the structure and properties of the superlattices. Here, we use a combination of in situ scattering and molecular simulation to elucidate the self-assembly of two common BNSLs through emulsion templating. Our self-assembly experiments reveal that no intermediate structures precede the formation of the final binary phases, indicating that their formation proceeds through classical nucleation. Using simulations, we find that, despite the formation of AlB2 and NaZn13 typically being attributed to entropy, their self-assembly is most consistent with the nanocrystals possessing short-range interparticle attraction, which we find can dramatically accelerate nucleation kinetics in BNSLs. We also find homogenous, classical nucleation in simulation, corroborating our experiments. These results establish a robust correspondence between experiment and theory, paving the way towards a priori prediction of BNSLs.</description>

      <title>Aluminum Scandium Nitride as a Functional Material at 1000{\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a highly promising material for high-temperature applications due to its robust piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and dielectric properties. This study investigates the behavior of Al0.7Sc0.3N thin films in extreme thermal environments, demonstrating functional stability up to 1000{\deg}C, making it suitable for use in aerospace, hypersonics, deep-well, and nuclear reactor systems. Tantalum silicide (TaSi2)/Al0.7Sc0.3N/TaSi2 capacitors were fabricated and characterized across a wide temperature range, revealing robust ferroelectric and dielectric properties, along with significant enhancement in piezoelectric performance. At 1000{\deg}C, the ferroelectric hysteresis loops showed a substantial reduction in coercive field from 4.3 MV/cm to 1.2 MV/cm, while the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient increased nearly tenfold, reaching 75.1 pm/V at 800{\deg}C. Structural analysis via scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the integrity of the TaSi2/Al0.7Sc0.3N interfaces, even after exposure to extreme temperatures. Furthermore, the electromechanical coupling coefficient was calculated to increase by over 500%, from 12.9% at room temperature to 82% at 700{\deg}C. These findings establish AlScN as a versatile material for high-temperature ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and dielectric applications, offering unprecedented thermal stability and functional enhancement.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Spontaneous Orientation Polarization in Organic Semiconductor Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of permanent dipole moments and the resulting spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) is commonly observed in evaporated neat films of polar organic molecules and leads to a so-called giant surface potential. In case of mixed films, often enhanced molecular orientation is observed, i.e.\ a higher degree of alignment, in comparison to neat layers, if it is diluted into a suitable (non-polar) host. So far, different possible influences on molecular orientation have been discussed, the most prominent probably being the so-called surface equilibration model. In this contribution, we discuss how surface equilibration can influence orientation in mixed layers, and which other intermolecular interactions have to be considered to explain the observed enhancement of SOP in mixed layers.</description>

      <title>Electronic and interfacial properties of 2D mxene/blue phosphorene heterostructures: impact of external strain for thermoelectric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures and enhancing their properties through strain engineering unlocks new applications for their constituent materials. In this study, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of oxygen-functionalized MXene-based heterostructures (M$_2$CO$_2$ (M=Sc,Zr,Hf)/blue phosphorene), emphasizing their structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties under the application of various types of strain. Our results indicate a reduction in band gap under strain and metallic transition for in-plane strain (uni- and bi-axial strain). Transition from type-I to type-II could be obtained for Hf$_2$CO$_2$/blueP and Zr$_2$CO$_2$/blueP heterostructure by applying strain, providing a method for their potential application in photocatalytic devices that require type-II band alignment for photogenerated charge separation. We observe a positive correlation between strain and thermoelectric efficiency under most conditions, with a significant enhancement in thermoelectric power factor (PF) and electronic figure of merit (ZTe) achievable in all heterostructures through strain engineering. Among the three heterostructures, Sc$_2$CO$_2$/blueP showed the maximum PF (ZTe) of $11.2 \times 10^{11}$ W/mK$^2$s (43.2) for 2% normal compressive (4% biaxial compressive) strain. These findings suggest that MX-ene/blueP heterostructures hold significant promise for applications in optoelectronics and high-temperature thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Interpreting tunneling spectroscopic maps of a dinuclear Co(II) complex on gold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscope data from a dinuclear Co(II) complex adsorbed on Au(111) are analysed using density functional theory calculations. We find that the interaction with the substrate substantially changes the geometry of the non-planar molecule. Its electronic states, however, remain fairly similar to those calculated for a gas-phase molecule. The calculations reproduce intriguing contrasts observed in experimental maps of the differential conductance dI/dV and reveal the relative importance of geometric and electronic factors that impinge on the image contrasts. For a meaningful comparison, it is important that the calculations closely mimic the experimental mode of measurement.</description>

      <title>Continuum Dislocation Dynamics as a Phase Field Theory with Conserved Order Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of dislocations can be formulated in terms of the evolution of continuous variables representing dislocation densities ('continuum dislocation dynamics'). We show for various variants of this approach that the resulting models can be envisaged in terms of the evolution of order-parameter like variables that strives to minimize a free energy functional which incorporates interface energy-like terms, i.e., as a phase field theory. We show that dislocation density variables obey non-standard conservation laws. These lead, in conjunction with the externally supplied work, to evolution equations that go beyond the classical framework of Ginzburg-Landau vs Cahn-Hilliard equations. The approach is applied to the evolution of dislocation patterns in materials with B1(NaCl) lattice structure.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient 4D-STEM in SEM: Beyond 2D Materials to Metallic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) is a powerful tool that allows for the simultaneous acquisition of spatial and diffraction information, driven by recent advancements in direct electron detector technology. Although 4D-STEM has been predominantly developed for and used in conventional TEM and STEM, efforts are being made to implement the technique in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In this paper, we push the boundaries of 4D-STEM in SEM and extend its capabilities in three key aspects: (1) faster acquisition rate with reduced data size, (2) higher angular resolution, and (3) application to various materials including conventional alloys and focused ion beam (FIB) lamella. Specifically, operating the MiniPIX Timepix3 detector in the event-driven mode significantly improves the acquisition rate by a factor of a few tenths compared to conventional frame-based mode, thereby opening up possibilities for integrating 4D-STEM into various in situ SEM testing. Furthermore, with a novel stage-detector geometry, a camera length of 160 mm is achieved which improves the angular resolution amplifying its utility, for example, magnetic or electric field imaging. Lastly, we successfully imaged a nanostructured platinum-copper thin film with a grain size of 16 nm and a thickness of 20 nm, and identified annealing twins in FIB-prepared polycrystalline copper using virtual darkfield imaging and orientation mapping. This work demonstrates the potential of synergetic combination of 4D-STEM with in situ experiments, and broadening its applications across a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Nanothermodynamics: There's plenty of room on the inside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanothermodynamics provides the theoretical foundation for understanding stable distributions of statistically independent subsystems inside larger systems. In this review it is emphasized that adapting ideas from nanothermodynamics to simplistic models improves agreement with the measured properties of many materials. Examples include non-classical critical scaling near ferromagnetic transitions, thermal and dynamic behavior near liquid-glass transitions, and the 1/f-like noise in metal films and qubits. A key feature in several models is to allow separate time steps for distinct conservation laws: one type of step conserves energy and the other conserves momentum (e.g. dipole alignment). This "orthogonal dynamics" explains how the relaxation of a single parameter can exhibit multiple responses such as primary, secondary, and microscopic peaks in the dielectric loss of supercooled liquids, and the crossover in thermal fluctuations from Johnson-Nyquist (white) noise at high frequencies to 1/f-like noise at low frequencies. Nanothermodynamics also provides new insight into three basic questions. First, it gives a novel solution to Gibbs' paradox for the entropy of the semi-classical ideal gas. Second, it yields the stable equilibrium of Ising's original model for finite-sized chains of interacting binary degrees of freedom ("spins"). Third, it confronts Loschmidt's paradox for the arrow of time, showing that an intrinsically irreversible step is required for maximum entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, not only in the thermodynamic limit but also in systems as small as N=2 particles</description>

      <title>Theory of excitonic order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that kagome metals can feature an excitonic condensate of unconventional nature. Studying the recently discovered variant ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, we identify electron and hole pockets due to a pair of van Hove singularities (vHS) close to the Fermi level, with an approximate spectral particle-hole symmetry at low energies. A significant fraction of the Fermi level density of states away from the vHS is removed by the onset of high temperature charge density wave order, and makes the bands more two dimensional, setting the stage for the formation of excitons. We develop a two-orbital minimal model which captures these features, along with the sublattice support of the wavefunctions, and find $s$-wave or $d$-wave excitons depending on the microscopic interaction parameters -- the latter of which exhibits either a charge nematic or time-reversal symmetry breaking flux order depending on strain, offering an explanation of recent STM and transport experiments. The appearance of particle-type and hole-type vHS, and the excitonic resonance associated with it, may be a common thread to understanding nematicity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in kagome metals.</description>

Abstract: Kagome lattice $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) superconductors without magnetism from vanadium $d$-electrons are intriguing because they have a novel charge density wave (CDW) order around 90 K and display superconductivity at $\sim$3 K that competes with the CDW order. Recently, CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, isostructural to $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, was found to have concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at $T^{\ast}\approx$ 55 K that can be suppressed by pressure to induce superconductivity [Liu \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07761-x}{Nature \textbf{632}, 1032 (2024)}]. Here, we use elastic and inelastic X-ray scattering to study the microscopic origin of the structural transition in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. Although our elastic measurements confirm the 4$\times$1$\times$1 superlattice order below $T^{\ast}$, its underlying correlation is rather short-ranged. Moreover, our inelastic measurements at the superlattice wavevectors around (3, 0, 0) find no evidence of a significant acoustic phonon anomaly below $T^{\ast}$, similar to the case of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. The absence of acoustic phonon anomaly indicates a weak electron-phonon coupling in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, suggesting that the structural transition is likely associated with an unconventional CDW order.</description>

      <title>Tunable Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Crystal Order in Spin-Splitting Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect provides dissipationless chiral channels for spin transport, expected as an outstanding candidate in future low-power quantum computation. The spin-splitting band structure is vital for obtaining QAH effect in topological systems, with ferromagnetism indispensable to manipulate the Chern number. Herein, we challenge this wisdom by proposing tunable QAH effect in spin-splitting antiferromagnets with zero magnetization. Since the spin splitting of these unique magnets originates from the alternate crystal environment, the Chern number can be modulated not only by the conventional magnetic order, but also by the crystal order, opening an additional dimension for tuning QAH effect. Our concept is illustrated based on two-dimensional (2D) MnBi2Te4 (MBT) with even septuple layers (SLs), a typical axion insulator with fully magnetic compensation. By interlayer rotation and translation operations, sublattices of MBT with opposite magnetizations are no longer connected by inversion or mirror symmetries, leading to the transition to the QAH insulator. The flexible stacking of 2D materials enables the reversible Chern number by crystal design. Our work fundamentally reveals the crystal-order-dependent QAH effect in spin-splitting antiferromagnets, which would advance QAH effect-based devices towards high controllability, integration density and operation speed.</description>

      <title>Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis, enabling the efficient screening of potential catalysts. However, determining adsorption energy involves comparing the energies of multiple adsorbate-catalyst configurations, which is computationally demanding due to a large number of possible configurations. Current algorithmic approaches typically enumerate adsorption sites and configurations without leveraging theoretical insights to guide the initial setup. In this work, we present Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently derive system-specific stable adsorption configurations with minimal human intervention. Adsorb-Agent leverages built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities, significantly reducing the number of initial configurations required while improving accuracy in predicting the minimum adsorption energy. We demonstrate its performance using two example systems, NNH-CuPd3 (111) and NNH-Mo3Pd (111), for the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR), a sustainable alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. Adsorb-Agent outperforms conventional "heuristic" and "random" algorithms by identifying lower-energy configurations with fewer initial setups, reducing computational costs while enhancing accuracy. This highlights its potential to accelerate catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase effects in dipole superfluids: vortex lattices and singular domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the response of dipole superfluids to an applied electromagnetic field, drawing parallels to the Meissner effect in conventional superconductors. While superconductors, consisting of electric monopoles, interact with magnetic fields via the Aharonov-Bohm phase, magnetic-dipole superfluids -- composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic dipole moments -- interact with electric fields through the Aharonov-Casher phase, where spatially modulating electric fields act as pseudo-magnetic fields. This leads to a distinct response compared to conventional superconductors. We develop a phenomenological theory to describe this behavior, revealing that the magnetic-dipole superfluid under a pseudo-magnetic field forms a vortex lattice, separated by singular domain walls where the pseudo-magnetic field and the charge density diverge. A similar effect is predicted in electric-dipole superfluids, where electric and magnetic roles are reversed, establishing the singular domain wall formation as a fundamental property of dipole condensates.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ dynamical mean-field theory with natural orbitals renormalization group impurity solver: Formalism and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel implementation of density functional theory integrated with single-site dynamical mean-field theory to investigate the complex properties of strongly correlated materials. This comprehensive first-principles many-body computational toolkit, termed $\texttt{Zen}$, utilizes the Vienna $\textit{ab initio}$ simulation package and the $\texttt{Quantum ESPRESSO}$ code to perform density functional theory calculations and generate band structures for realistic materials. The challenges associated with correlated electron systems are addressed through two distinct yet complementary quantum impurity solvers: the natural orbitals renormalization group solver for zero temperature and the hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo solver for finite temperature. Additionally, this newly developed toolkit incorporates several valuable post-processing tools, such as $\texttt{ACFlow}$, which employs the maximum entropy method and the stochastic pole expansion method for the analytic continuation of Matsubara Green's functions and self-energy functions. To validate the performance of this toolkit, we examine three representative cases: the correlated metal SrVO$_{3}$, the nickel-based unconventional superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, and the wide-gap Mott insulator MnO. The results obtained demonstrate strong agreement with experimental findings and previously available theoretical results. Notably, we successfully elucidate the quasiparticle peak and band renormalization in SrVO$_{3}$, the dominance of Hund correlation in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, and the pressure-driven insulator-metal transition as well as the high-spin to low-spin transition in MnO. These findings suggest that $\texttt{Zen}$ is proficient in accurately describing the electronic structures of $d$-electron correlated materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-induced assembly of colloidal particles into structures of desired configurations is extremely relevant from the viewpoint of producing field-assembled micro-swimmers and reconfigurable smart materials. However, the behaviour of colloidal particles under the influence of alternating current (AC) electric fields remains a topic of ongoing investigation due to the complex effects of various control parameters. Here we examine the role of several factors including particle size, zeta potential, voltage and frequency of the applied field in the formation of different structural configurations ranging from crystals to glasses, and observe interesting and unexpected behaviours in the structure formation. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of structure formation; the nature of diffusion and active motion in these out-of-equilibrium systems, and show how that leads to the formation of close-packed or open structures. Lastly, we investigate the frequency-driven disorder-order-disorder phase transition in colloidal crystals, which is a starting point for building reconfigurable systems. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the significant roles of various factors in electric field-induced assembly of colloidal particles, as well as pave the way for potential applications in micro-robotics and next-generation materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory for a minimal oscillator model of exciton-plasmon coupling in hybrids of 2d semiconductors and metal nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common model to describe exciton-plasmon interaction phenomenologically is the coupled oscillator model. Originally developed for atomic systems rather than solid-state matter, this model treats both excitons and plasmons as single harmonic oscillators coupled via a constant which can be fitted to experiments. In this work, we present a modified coupled oscillator model specifically designed for exciton-plasmon interactions in hybrids composed of two-dimensional excitons, such as in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers and metal nanoparticles while maintaining the simplicity of the commonly applied coupled oscillator models. Our approach is based on a microscopic perspective and Maxwell's equations, allowing to analytically derive an effective exciton-plasmon coupling constant. Our findings highlight the importance of the spatial dispersion, i.e., the delocalized nature of TMDC excitons, necessitating the distinction between bright and momentum-dark excitons. Both types of excitons occur at different resonance energies and exhibit a qualitatively different coupling with localized plasmons. We find a strong coupling between the plasmon and momentum-dark excitons, while a weakly coupled bright exciton manifests as an additional, third peak in the spectrum. Consequently, we propose a realistic modeling of the primary spectral features in experiments incorporating three harmonic oscillator equations instead of the conventional two. However, we also shed light on the limitations of the three coupled oscillator model in describing the line shape of extinction and scattering cross section spectra.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic information processing using ultrafast heat dynamics and quench switching of an antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving complex tasks in a modern information-driven society requires novel materials and concepts for energy-efficient hardware. Antiferromagnets offer a promising platform for seeking such approaches due to their exceptional features: low power consumption and possible high integration density are desirable for information storage and processing or applications in unconventional computing. Among antiferromagnets, CuMnAs stands out for atomic-level scalable magnetic textures, analogue multilevel storage capability, and the magnetic state's control by a single electrical or femtosecond laser pulse. Using a pair of excitation laser pulses, this work examines synaptic and neuronal functionalities of CuMnAs for information processing, readily incorporating two principles of distinct characteristic timescales. Laser-induced transient heat dynamics at sub-nanosecond times represents the short-term memory and causes resistance switching due to quenching into a magnetically fragmented state. This quench switching, detectable electrically from ultrashort times to hours after writing, reminisces the long-term memory. The versatility of the principles' combination is demonstrated by operations commonly used in neural networks. Temporal latency coding, fundamental to spiking neural networks, is utilized to encode data from a grayscale image into sub-nanosecond pulse delays. Applying input laser pulses with distinct amplitudes then allows for pulse-pattern recognition. The results open pathways for designing novel computing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behavior of non-idealized Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. Using a beam element simulator, we systematically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy has been used to investigate ultrafast photo-induced charge carrier transport in 3.4 $\mu$m wide graphene ribbons upon scaling the optical pump intensity. For low pump fluences, the deposited pump energy is rapidly redistributed through carrier-carrier scattering, producing secondary hot carriers: the picosecond THz photoconductivity then acquires a negative sign and scales linearly with an increasing pump fluence. At higher fluences, there are not enough equilibrium carriers able to accept the deposited energy, directly generated (excess) carriers start to contribute significantly to the photoconductivity with a positive sign leading to its saturation behavior. This leads to a non-monotonic variation of the carrier mobility and plasmonic resonance frequency as a function of the pump fluence and, at high fluences, to a balance between a decreasing carrier scattering time and an increasing Drude weight. In addition, a weak carrier localization observed for the polarization parallel to the ribbons at low pump fluences is progressively lifted upon increasing the pump fluence as a result of the rise of initial carrier temperature.</description>

Abstract: We perform machine learning (ML) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to search for materials with low lattice thermal conductivity, $\kappa_L$. Several cadmium (Cd) compounds containing elements from the alkali-metal and carbon groups including A$_2$CdX (A = Li, Na, and K; X = Pb, Sn, and Ge) are predicted by our ML models to exhibit very low $\kappa_L$ values ($&lt; 1.0 $ W/mK), rendering these materials suitable for potential thermal management and insulation applications. Further DFT calculations of electronic and transport properties indicate that the figure of merit, $ZT$, for thermoelectric performance can exceed 1.0 in compounds such as K$_2$CdPb, K$_2$CdSn, and K$_2$CdGe, which are thereby also promising thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Exotic Spin Texture in Supramolecular Metal Complexes on a 2D Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designer heterostructures, where the desired physics emerges from the controlled interactions between different components, represent one of the most powerful strategies to realize unconventional electronic states. This approach has been particularly fruitful in combining magnetism and superconductivity to create exotic superconducting states. In this work, we use a heterostructure platform combining supramolecular metal complexes (SMCs) with a quasi-2D van der Waals (vdW) superconductor NbSe$_2$. Our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements demonstrate the emergence of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands arising from the interaction between the SMC magnetism and the NbSe$_2$ superconductivity. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements, we show the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling between the SMC units. These result in the emergence of an unconventional $3\times3$ reconstruction in the magnetic ground state that is directly reflected in real space modulation of the YSR bands. The combination of flexible molecular building blocks, frustrated magnetic textures, and superconductivity in heterostructures establishes a fertile starting point to fabricating tunable quantum materials, including unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental observations of dilute ion spin ensemble defects in a low-loss single crystal cylindrical sample of CaWO$_4$ cooled to $30$ mK in temperature. Crystal field perturbations were elucidated by constructing a dielectrically loaded microwave cavity resonator from the crystal. The resonator exhibited numerous whispering gallery modes with high $Q$-factors of up to $3\times 10^7$, equivalent to a loss tangent of $\sim 3\times 10^{-8}$. The low loss allowed precision multi-mode spectroscopy of numerous high $Q$-factor photon-spin interactions. Measurements between 7 to 22 GHz revealed the presence of Gd$^{3+}$, Fe$^{3+}$, and another trace species, inferred to be rare-earth, at concentrations on the order of parts per billion. These findings motivate further exploration of prospective uses of this low-loss dielectric material for applications regarding precision and quantum metrology, as well as tests for beyond standard model physics.</description>

Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>A mathematical justification for nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain</title>

Abstract: We present an asymptotic framework that rigorously generates nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain for elastic bodies. Each of these relations arises as the leading order relationship satisfied by a one-parameter family of nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and nonlinear strain. The asymptotic parameter limits the overall range of strains that satisfy the corresponding constitutive relation in the one-parameter family while the stresses can remain large (relative to a fixed stress scale). This differs from classical linearized elasticity where a fixed constitutive relation is assumed, and the magnitude of the displacement gradient serves as the asymptotic parameter. Also unlike classical approaches, the constitutive relations in our framework are expressed as implicit relationships between stress and strain rather than requiring stress explicitly expressed as a function of strain, adding conceptual simplicity and versatility. We demonstrate that our framework rigorously justifies nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain including those with density-dependent Young's moduli or derived from strain energies beyond quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Microheterogeneity and Single-Molecule Mixture Science: An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14485v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microheterogeneity, as a fundamental natural property, is widely presented in a range of microscopic systems such as polymer systems, biomacromolecular systems, and nanosystems, however, the construction of molecular systems of this form has not yet been realized at the level of organic molecules with well-defined structural compositions.Inspired by the "chemical space"concept, I recently reported a study of the single-molecule mixture state, In this preprint,a detailed discussion of microheterogeneity and the concept of "single-molecule mixture" has been provided.</description>
