      <title>SOREL: A Stochastic Algorithm for Spectral Risks Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral risk has wide applications in machine learning, especially in real-world decision-making, where people are not only concerned with models' average performance. By assigning different weights to the losses of different sample points, rather than the same weights as in the empirical risk, it allows the model's performance to lie between the average performance and the worst-case performance. In this paper, we propose SOREL, the first stochastic gradient-based algorithm with convergence guarantees for the spectral risk minimization. Previous algorithms often consider adding a strongly concave function to smooth the spectral risk, thus lacking convergence guarantees for the original spectral risk. We theoretically prove that our algorithm achieves a near-optimal rate of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ in terms of $\epsilon$. Experiments on real datasets show that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in most cases, both in terms of runtime and sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Programming Techniques for Planar Orbital Transfer of Low Earth Orbit Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an application of the optimal control theory to orbital transfer of Low Earth Orbit satellites. The optimal control problem is treated with Dynamic Programming techniques which require solving the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation on a suitable state space, with the reconstruction of the optimal controls made in the form of a static feedback. In order to validate the numerical scheme without the complexity of the full model, this first study sets the problem in planar form, thus working in a four-dimensional state space. We will study various techniques to speed up the computation, and assess the accuracy of the numerical solution.
  This project is born from the attempt of evaluating and applying direct method of optimal control techniques based on Dynamic Programming as a complementary approach to the well known indirect methods, as Pontryagin or Lawden. In particular, the final aim is to treat the case of low thrust engines from real use cases, in the full 3-D problem.</description>

      <title>A Pseudo-Gradient Approach for Model-free Markov Chain Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a first-order (pseudo-)gradient approach for optimizing functions over the stationary distribution of discrete-time Markov chains (DTMC). We give insights into why solving this optimization problem is challenging and show how transformations can be used to circumvent the hard constraints inherent in the optimization problem. The optimization framework is model-free since no explicit model of the interdependence of the row elements of the Markov chain transition matrix is required. Upon the transformation we build an extension of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm, called stochastic matrix SPSA (SM-SPSA) to solve the optimization problem. The performance of the SM-SPSA gradient search is compared with a benchmark commercial solver. Numerical examples show that SM-SPSA scales better which makes it the preferred solution method for large problem instances. We also apply the algorithm to the maximization of web-page rankings in web-graphs based on a real-life data set. As we explain in the paper, when applying a first-order gradient search one typically encounters a phenomenon which we call ``infliction points," that is, jumps in the optimization trajectories between periods of almost stationary behavior that slow down the optimization. We propose a heuristic for avoiding such infliction points and present a metastudy on a wide range of networks showing the positive effect of our heuristic on the convergence properties of SM-SPSA gradient search.</description>

      <title>A Convex-Nonconvex Framework for Enhancing Minimization Induced Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for nonconvex enhancement of minimization induced (MI) penalties while preserving the overall convexity of associated regularization models. MI penalties enable the adaptation to certain signal structures via minimization, but often underestimate significant components owing to convexity. To overcome this shortcoming, we design a generalized Moreau enhanced minimization induced (GME-MI) penalty by subtracting from the MI penalty its generalized Moreau envelope. While the proposed GME-MI penalty is nonconvex in general, we derive an overall convexity condition for the GME-MI regularized least-squares model. Moreover, we present a proximal splitting algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a globally optimal solution of the GME-MI model under the overall convexity condition. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Optimizing over Multiple Distributions under Generalized Quasar-Convexity Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a typical optimization model where the optimization variable is composed of multiple probability distributions. Though the model appears frequently in practice, such as for policy problems, it lacks specific analysis in the general setting. For this optimization problem, we propose a new structural condition/landscape description named generalized quasar-convexity (GQC) beyond the realms of convexity. In contrast to original quasar-convexity \citep{hinder2020near}, GQC allows an individual quasar-convex parameter $\gamma_i$ for each variable block $i$ and the smaller of $\gamma_i$ implies less block-convexity. To minimize the objective function, we consider a generalized oracle termed as the internal function that includes the standard gradient oracle as a special case. We provide optimistic mirror descent (OMD) for multiple distributions and prove that the algorithm can achieve an adaptive $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((\sum_{i=1}^d1/\gamma_i)\epsilon^{-1})$ iteration complexity to find an $epsilon$-suboptimal global solution without pre-known the exact values of $\gamma_i$ when the objective admits ``polynomial-like'' structural. Notably, it achieves iteration complexity that does not explicitly depend on the number of distributions and strictly faster $(\sum_{i=1}^d 1/\gamma_i \text{ v.s. } d\max_{i\in[1:d]} 1/\gamma_i)$ than mirror decent methods. We also extend GQC to the minimax optimization problem proposing the generalized quasar-convexity-concavity (GQCC) condition and a decentralized variant of OMD with regularization. Finally, we show the applications of our algorithmic framework on discounted Markov Decision Processes problem and Markov games, which bring new insights on the landscape analysis of reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Black-box Optimization Algorithms for Regularized Least-squares Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the sum of a smooth, nonconvex function for which derivatives are unavailable, and a convex, nonsmooth function with easy-to-evaluate proximal operator. Of particular focus is the case where the smooth part has a nonlinear least-squares structure. We adapt two existing approaches for derivative-free optimization of nonsmooth compositions of smooth functions to this setting. Our main contribution is adapting our algorithm to handle inexactly computed stationary measures, where the inexactness is adaptively adjusted as required by the algorithm (where previous approaches assumed access to exact stationary measures, which is not realistic in this setting). Numerically, we provide two extensions of the state-of-the-art DFO-LS solver for nonlinear least-squares problems and demonstrate their strong practical performance.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model-Predictive Energy Management Strategy for Shipboard Power Systems Considering Battery Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the integration of loads such as pulse power loads, a new control challenge is presented in meeting their high ramp rate requirements. Existing onboard generators are ramp rate limited. The inability to meet the load power due to ramp rate limitation may lead to instability. The addition of energy storage elements in addition to the existing generators proves a viable solution in addressing the control challenges presented by high ramp rate loads. A distributed energy management strategy maximizing generator efficiency and minimizing energy storage degradation is developed that facilitates an optimal adaptive power split between generators and energy storage elements. The complex structure of the energy storage degradation model makes it tough for its direct integration into the optimization problem and is not practical for real-time implementation. A degradation heuristic to minimize absolute power extracted from the energy storage elements is proposed as a degradation heuristic measure. The designed strategy is tested through a numerical case study of a consolidated shipboard power system model consisting of a single generator, energy storage element, and load model. The results show the impact of the designed energy management strategy in effectively managing energy storage health.</description>

      <title>A Distributionally Robust Optimization Framework for Stochastic Assessment of Power System Flexibility in Economic Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the complexity of power systems, particularly the high-dimensional variability of net loads, accurately depicting the entire operational range of net loads poses a challenge. To address this, recent methodologies have sought to gauge the maximum range of net load uncertainty across all buses. In this paper, we consider the stochastic nature of the net load and introduce a distributionally robust optimization framework that assesses system flexibility stochastically, accommodating a minimal extent of system violations. We verify the proposed method by solving the flexibility of the real-time economic dispatch problem on four IEEE standard test systems. Compared to traditional deterministic flexibility evaluations, our approach consistently yields less conservative flexibility outcomes.</description>

      <title>On the strength of Burer's lifted convex relaxation to quadratic programming with ball constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quadratic programs with $m$ ball constraints, and the strength of a lifted convex relaxation for it recently proposed by Burer (2024). Burer shows this relaxation is exact when $m=2$. For general $m$, Burer (2024) provides numerical evidence that this lifted relaxation is tighter than the Kronecker product based Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) inequalities introduced by Anstreicher (2017), and conjectures that this must be theoretically true as well. In this note, we provide an affirmative answer to this question and formally prove that this lifted relaxation indeed implies the Kronecker inequalities. Our proof is based on a decomposition of non-rank-one extreme rays of the lifted relaxation for each pair of ball constraints. Burer (2024) also numerically observes that for this lifted relaxation, an RLT-based inequality proposed by Zhen et al. (2021) is redundant, and conjectures this to be theoretically true as well. We also provide a formal proof that Zhen et al. (2021) inequalities are redundant for this lifted relaxation. In addition, we establish that Burer's lifted relaxation is a particular case of the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Low-Rank Factorization-Based Semidefinite Programming Algorithms on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a long-standing challenge: how to achieve both efficiency and scalability in solving semidefinite programming problems. We propose breakthrough acceleration techniques for a wide range of low-rank factorization-based first-order methods using GPUs, making the computation much more efficient and scalable. To illustrate the idea and effectiveness of our approach, we use the low-rank factorization-based SDP solver, LoRADS, as an example, which involves both the classic Burer-Monterio method and a novel splitting scheme with a starting logarithmic rank. Our numerical results demonstrate that the accelerated GPU version of LoRADS, cuLoRADS, can solve huge-scale semidefinite programming problems with remarkable efficiency. By effectively leveraging GPU computational power, cuLoRADS exhibits outstanding performance. Specifically, it can solve a set of MaxCut problems with $10^7 \times 10^7$ matrix variables in 10 seconds to 1 minute each on an NVIDIA H100 GPU with 80GB memory, whereas previous solvers demonstrated the capability of handling problems of this scale, required at least dozens of hours per problem on CPUs. Additionally, cuLoRADS shows exceptional scalability by solving 1) a MaxCut problem with a $170 \text{ million} \times 170 \text{ million}$ matrix variable and 2) a Matrix Completion problem with a 20 million $\times$ 20 million matrix variable and approximately 200 million constraints, both in a matter of minutes.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Trilateration: Approximate Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Initial Orbit Determination in Low-Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increase in the number of active satellites and space debris in orbit, the problem of initial orbit determination (IOD) becomes increasingly important, demanding a high accuracy. Over the years, different approaches have been presented such as filtering methods (for example, Extended Kalman Filter), differential algebra or solving Lambert's problem. In this work, we consider a setting of three monostatic radars, where all available measurements are taken approximately at the same instant. This follows a similar setting as trilateration, a state-of-the-art approach, where each radar is able to obtain a single measurement of range and range-rate. Differently, and due to advances in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radars, we assume that each location is able to obtain a larger set of range, angle and Doppler shift measurements. Thus, our method can be understood as an extension of trilateration leveraging more recent technology and incorporating additional data. We formulate the problem as a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which for some number of observations is asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically efficient. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method attains the same accuracy as the trilateration method for the same number of measurements and offers an alternative and generalization, returning a more accurate estimation of the satellite's state vector, as the number of available measurements increases.</description>

      <title>Exact Convergence rate of the subgradient method by using Polyak step size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the last iterate of subgradient method with Polyak step size when applied to the minimization of a nonsmooth convex function with bounded subgradients. We show that the subgradient method with Polyak step size achieves a convergence rate $\mathcal{O}\left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt[4]{N}}\right)$ in terms of the final iterate. An example is provided to show that this rate is exact and cannot be improved. We introduce an adaptive Polyak step size for which the subgradient method enjoys a convergence rate $\mathcal{O}\left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$ for the last iterate. Its convergence rate matches exactly the lower bound on the performance of any black-box method on the considered problem class. Additionally, we propose an adaptive Polyak method with a momentum term, where the step sizes are independent of the number of iterates. We establish that the algorithm also attains the optimal convergence rate. We investigate the alternating projection method. We derive a convergence rate $\left( \frac{2N }{ 2N+1 } \right)^N\tfrac{R}{\sqrt{2N+1}}$ for the last iterate, where $R$ is a bound on the distance between the initial iterate and a solution. An example is also provided to illustrate the exactness of the rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the natural extended-variable formulation for the disjunction of $n+1$ polytopes in $R^d$. We demonstrate that the convex hull $D$ in the natural extended-variable space $R^{d+n}$ is given by full optimal big-M lifting (i) when $d\leq 2$ (and that it is not generally true for $d\geq 3$), and also (ii) under some technical conditions, when the polytopes have a common facet-describing constraint matrix, for arbitrary $d\geq 1$ and $n\geq 1$. Additionally, we give further results on the polyhedral structure of $D$, and we demonstrate that all facets of $D$ can be enumerated in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Weyl Calculus and Exactly Solvable Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges with Quadratic State Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge--a stochastic dynamical generalization of optimal mass transport--exhibits a learning-control duality. Viewed as a stochastic control problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers a given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control effort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a stochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely distribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations, i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over the manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov kernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as a state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in quantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help determine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding the Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus, recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Input-to-state stabilization of $1$-D parabolic equations with Dirichlet boundary disturbances under boundary fixed-time control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of stabilization of $1$-D parabolic equations with destabilizing terms and Dirichlet boundary disturbances. By using the method of backstepping and the technique of splitting, a boundary feedback controller is designed to ensure the input-to-state stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system with Dirichlet boundary disturbances, while preserving fixed-time stability (FTS) of the corresponding disturbance-free system, for which the fixed time is either determined by the Riemann zeta function or freely prescribed. To overcome the difficulty brought by Dirichlet boundary disturbances, the ISS and FTS properties of the involved systems are assessed by applying the generalized Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme of control design.</description>

      <title>Robust personalized pricing under uncertainty of purchase probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with personalized pricing models aimed at maximizing the expected revenues or profits for a single item. While it is essential for personalized pricing to predict the purchase probabilities for each consumer, these predicted values are inherently subject to unavoidable errors that can negatively impact the realized revenues and profits. To address this issue, we focus on robust optimization techniques that yield reliable solutions to optimization problems under uncertainty. Specifically, we propose a robust optimization model for personalized pricing that accounts for the uncertainty of predicted purchase probabilities. This model can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization problem, which can be solved exactly using mathematical optimization solvers. We also develop a Lagrangian decomposition algorithm combined with line search to efficiently find high-quality solutions for large-scale optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our robust optimization model and highlight the utility of our Lagrangian decomposition algorithm in terms of both computational efficiency and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal $L_p$ Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex risk measures play a foundational role in the area of stochastic optimization. However, in contrast to risk neutral models, their applications are still limited due to the lack of efficient solution methods. In particular, the mean $L_p$ semi-deviation is a classic risk minimization model, but its solution is highly challenging due to the composition of concave-convex functions and the lack of uniform Lipschitz continuity. In this paper, we discuss some progresses on the design of efficient algorithms for $L_p$ risk minimization, including a novel lifting reformulation to handle the concave-convex composition, and a new stochastic approximation method to handle the non-Lipschitz continuity. We establish an upper bound on the sample complexity associated with this approach and show that this bound is not improvable for $L_p$ risk minimization in general.</description>

Abstract: TU-games with utility functions are considered. Generalizations of the prenucleolus, essential coalitions and the core: the u-prenucleolus, u-essential coalitions and the u-core respectively are introduced. We show that u-essential coalitions form a characterisation set for the u-prenucleolus in case of games with nonempty u-core.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Iterates for Momentum and RMSProp for Local Smooth Functions: Adaptation is the Key</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both accelerated and adaptive gradient methods are among state of the art algorithms to train neural networks. The tuning of hyperparameters is needed to make them work efficiently. For classical gradient descent, a general and efficient way to adapt hyperparameters is the Armijo backtracking. The goal of this work is to generalize the Armijo linesearch to Momentum and RMSProp, two popular optimizers of this family, by means of stability theory of dynamical systems. We establish convergence results, under the Lojasiewicz assumption, for these strategies. As a direct result, we obtain the first guarantee on the convergence of the iterates for RMSProp, in the non-convex setting without the classical bounded assumptions.</description>

      <title>Fast second-order dynamics with slow vanishing damping approaching the zeros of a monotone and continuous operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we approach the problem of finding the zeros of a continuous and monotone operator through a second-order dynamical system with a damping term of the form $1/t^{r}$, where $r\in [0, 1]$. The system features the time derivative of the operator evaluated along the trajectory, which is a Hessian-driven type damping term when the governing operator comes from a potential. Also entering the system is a time rescaling parameter $\beta(t)$ which satisfies a certain growth condition. We derive $o\left(\frac{1}{t^{2r}\beta(t)}\right)$ convergence rates for the norm of the operator evaluated along the generated trajectories as well as for a gap function which serves as a measure of optimality for the associated variational inequality. The parameter $r$ enters the growth condition for $\beta(t)$: when $r &lt; 1$, the damping $1/t^{r}$ approaches zero at a slower speed than Nesterov's $1/t$ damping; in this case, we are allowed to choose $\beta(t)$ to be an exponential function, thus having linear convergence rates for the involved quantities. We also show weak convergence of the trajectories towards zeros of the governing operator. Through a particular choice for the operator, we establish a connection with the problem of minimizing a smooth and convex function with linear constraints. The convergence rates we derived in the operator case are inherited by the objective function evaluated at the trajectories and for the feasibility gap. We also prove weak convergence of the trajectories towards primal-dual solutions of the problem.
  A discretization of the dynamical system yields an implicit algorithm that exhibits analogous convergence properties to its continuous counterpart.
  We complement our theoretical findings with two numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We consider the linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem for a class of evolution equations in infinite dimensions, in the presence of distributed and nonlocal inputs. Following the perspective taken in our previous research work on the LQ problem for integro-differential equations, where the memory term -- here involving the control actions -- is seen as a component of the state, we offer a full (closed-loop, Riccati-like) solution to the optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Competing DEA procedures: analysis, testing, and comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the computational time to process large data sets in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is the objective of many studies. Contributions include fundamentally innovative procedures, new or improved preprocessors, and hybridization between - and among - all these. Ultimately, new contributions are made when the number and size of the LPs solved is somehow reduced. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of two competing procedures to process DEA data sets: BuildHull and Enhanced Hierarchical Decomposition (EHD). A common ground for comparison is made by examining their sequential implementations, applying to both the same preprocessors - when permitted - on a suite of data sets widely employed in the computational DEA literature. In addition to reporting on execution time, we discuss how the data characteristics affect performance and we introduce using the number and size of the LPs solved to better understand performances and explain differences. Our experiments show that the dominance of BuildHull can be substantial in large-scale and high-density datasets. Comparing and explaining performance based on the number and size of LPS lays the groundwork for a comparison of the parallel implementations of procedures BuildHull and EHD.</description>

      <title>A Review on Response Strategies in Infrastructure Network Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the literature on response strategies for restoring infrastructure networks in the aftermath of a disaster. Our motivation for this review is twofold. First, the frequency and magnitude of natural and man-made disasters (e.g., wild fires, tornadoes, global pandemics, terrorist attacks) have been increasing. These events disrupt the operation of infrastructure networks, preventing the delivery of vital goods and services such as power and food. Therefore, it is critical to understand the state-of-the-art in responding to network disruptions in order to develop efficient strategies to mitigate their impacts. Second, it is critical to enable timely decisions in a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment while accounting for numerous interrelated factors. Because the vast majority of response decision problems are computationally challenging, quickly finding solutions that are compatible with real-time decision making is a difficult task. Hence, it is important to understand the nature of response activities and decisions, as well as the available solution methodologies and inherent trade-offs between computation time and solution quality. We review quantitative response methodologies developed for infrastructure network restoration, classifying relevant studies based on the properties of the underlying network. In particular, we focus on resource allocation, scheduling, routing and repair efforts within the domain of power, road, and water, oil and gas network restoration. We also discuss open research questions and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Singular perturbation in heavy ball dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a $C^{1,1}_\mathrm{loc}$ lower bounded function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ definable in an o-minimal structure on the real field, we show that the singular perturbation $\epsilon \searrow 0$ in the heavy ball system \begin{equation} \label{eq:P_eps} \tag{$P_\epsilon$}
  \epsilon\ddot{x}_\epsilon(t) + \gamma\dot{x}_\epsilon(t) + \nabla f(x_\epsilon(t)) = 0, ~~~ \forall t \geqslant 0, ~~~ x_\epsilon(0) = x_0, ~~~ \dot{x}_\epsilon(0) = \dot{x}_0, \end{equation} preserves boundedness of solutions, where $\gamma&gt;0$ is the friction and $(x_0,\dot{x}_0) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ is the initial condition. This complements the work of Attouch, Goudou, and Redont which deals with finite time horizons. In other words, this work studies the asymptotic behavior of a ball rolling on a surface subject to gravitation and friction, without assuming convexity nor coercivity.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for random nonlinear wave equations: weak dissipation and localized control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new criterion for exponential mixing of random dynamical systems. Our criterion is applicable to a wide range of systems, including in particular dispersive equations. Its verification is in nature related to several topics, i.e., asymptotic compactness in dynamical systems, global stability of evolution equations, and localized control problems.
  As an initial application, we exploit the exponential mixing of random nonlinear wave equations with degenerate damping, critical nonlinearity, and physically localized noise. The essential challenge lies in the fact that the weak dissipation and randomness interact in the evolution.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Salvo Guidance over Leader-Follower Network with Free-Will Arbitrary Time Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cooperative salvo strategy is proposed in this paper which achieves consensus among the interceptors within a pre-defined arbitrary settling time. Considering non-linear engagement kinematics and a system lag to capture the effect of interceptor autopilot as present in realistic interception scenarios, the guidance schemes use the time-to-go estimates of the interceptors in order to achieve simultaneous interception of a stationary target at a pre-determined impact time. The guidance scheme ensures that consensus among the time-to-go estimates of the interceptors is achieved within a settling time whose upper bound can be pre-specified arbitrarily independent of the initial conditions or design parameters. The efficacy of the proposed guidance strategy is demonstrated using numerical simulations with varied conditions of initial position, velocities and heading angle errors of the interceptors as well as different desired impact times.</description>

      <title>A New Theoretical Perspective on Data Heterogeneity in Federated Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data heterogeneity is the main reason that existing theoretical analyses are pessimistic about the convergence rate. In particular, for many FL algorithms, the convergence rate grows dramatically when the number of local updates becomes large, especially when the product of the gradient divergence and local Lipschitz constant is large. However, empirical studies can show that more local updates can improve the convergence rate even when these two parameters are large, which is inconsistent with the theoretical findings. This paper aims to bridge this gap between theoretical understanding and practical performance by providing a theoretical analysis from a new perspective on data heterogeneity. In particular, we propose a new and weaker assumption compared to the local Lipschitz gradient assumption, named the heterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz assumption. We show that this and the gradient divergence assumptions can jointly characterize the effect of data heterogeneity. By deriving a convergence upper bound for FedAvg and its extensions, we show that, compared to the existing works, local Lipschitz constant is replaced by the much smaller heterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz constant and the corresponding convergence upper bound can be significantly reduced for the same number of local updates, although its order stays the same. In addition, when the local objective function is quadratic, more insights on the impact of data heterogeneity can be obtained using the heterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz constant. For example, we can identify a region where FedAvg can outperform mini-batch SGD even when the gradient divergence can be arbitrarily large. Our findings are validated using experiments.</description>

      <title>Mokobodzki's intervals: an approach to Dynkin games when value process is not a semimartingale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Dynkin games governed by a nonlinear $\mathbb E^f$-expectation on a finite interval $[0,T]$, with payoff c\`adl\`ag processes $L,U$ of class (D) which are not imposed to satisfy (weak) Mokobodzki's condition - the existence of a c\`adl\`ag semimartingale between the barriers. For that purpose we introduce the notion of Mokobodzki's stochastic intervals $\mathscr M(\theta)$ (roughly speaking, maximal stochastic interval on which Mokobodzki's condition is satisfied when starting from the stopping time $\theta$) and the notion of reflected BSDEs without Mokobodzki's condition (this is a generalization and modification of the notion introduced by Hamad\'ene and Hassani (2005)). We prove an existence and uniqueness result for RBSDEs with driver $f$ that is non-increasing with respect to the value variable (no restrictions on the growth) and Lipschitz continuous with respect to the control variable, and with data in $L^1$ spaces. Next, by using RBSDEs, we show numerous results on Dynkin games: existence of the value process, saddle points, and convergence of the penalty scheme. We also show that the game is not played beyond $\mathscr M(\theta)$, when starting from $\theta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The progress of miniaturized technology allows controlling physical systems at nanoscale with remarkable precision in regimes where thermal fluctuations are non-negligible. Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of [1], provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. We show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory except at the boundary and the evolution of the variance is non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.</description>

Abstract: We consider feasibility and constrained optimization problems defined over smooth and/or strongly convex sets. These notions mirror their popular function counterparts but are much less explored in the first-order optimization literature. We propose new scalable, projection-free, accelerated first-order methods in these settings. Our methods avoid linear optimization or projection oracles, only using cheap one-dimensional linesearches and normal vector computations. Despite this, we derive optimal accelerated convergence guarantees of $O(1/T)$ for strongly convex problems, $O(1/T^2)$ for smooth problems, and accelerated linear convergence given both. Our algorithms and analysis are based on novel characterizations of the Minkowski gauge of smooth and/or strongly convex sets, which may be of independent interest: although the gauge is neither smooth nor strongly convex, we show the gauge squared inherits any structure present in the set.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation for Nonlinear Discrete Stochastic Control: Finite-Sample Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear discrete stochastic control system, and our goal is to design a feedback control policy in order to lead the system to a prespecified state. We adopt a stochastic approximation viewpoint of this problem. It is known that by solving the corresponding continuous-time deterministic system, and using the resulting feedback control policy, one ensures almost sure convergence to the prespecified state in the discrete system. In this paper, we adopt such a control mechanism and provide its finite-sample convergence bounds whenever a Lyapunov function is known for the continuous system. In particular, we consider four cases based on whether the Lyapunov function for the continuous system gives exponential or sub-exponential rates and based on whether it is smooth or not. We provide the finite-time bounds in all cases. Our proof relies on constructing a Lyapunov function for the discrete system based on the given Lyapunov function for the continuous system. We do this by appropriately smoothing the given function using the Moreau envelope. We present numerical experiments corresponding to the various cases, which validate the rates we establish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents strong worst-case iteration and operation complexity guarantees for Riemannian adaptive regularized Newton methods, a unified framework encompassing both Riemannian adaptive regularization (RAR) methods and Riemannian trust region (RTR) methods. We comprehensively characterize the sources of approximation in second-order manifold optimization methods: the objective function's smoothness, retraction's smoothness, and subproblem solver's inexactness. Specifically, for a function with a $\mu$-H\"older continuous Hessian, when equipped with a retraction featuring a $\nu$-H\"older continuous differential and a $\theta$-inexact subproblem solver, both RTR and RAR with $2+\alpha$ regularization (where $\alpha=\min\{\mu,\nu,\theta\}$) locate an $(\epsilon,\epsilon^{\alpha/(1+\alpha)})$-approximate second-order stationary point within at most $O(\epsilon^{-(2+\alpha)/(1+\alpha)})$ iterations and at most $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(4+3\alpha)/(2(1+\alpha))})$ Hessian-vector products. These complexity results are novel and sharp, and reduce to an iteration complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ and an operation complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-7/4})$ when $\alpha=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores numerical methods for solving a convex differentiable semi-infinite program. We introduce a primal-dual gradient method which performs three updates iteratively: a momentum gradient ascend step to update the constraint parameters, a momentum gradient ascend step to update the dual variables, and a gradient descend step to update the primal variables. Our approach also extends to scenarios where gradients and function values are accessible solely through stochastic oracles. This method extends the recent primal-dual methods, for example, Hamedani and Aybat (2021); Boob et al. (2022), for optimization with a finite number of constraints. We show the iteration complexity of the proposed method for finding an $\epsilon$-optimal solution under different convexity and concavity assumptions on the functions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimization with arbitrary recurrent data sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For obtaining optimal first-order convergence guarantee for stochastic optimization, it is necessary to use a recurrent data sampling algorithm that samples every data point with sufficient frequency. Most commonly used data sampling algorithms (e.g., i.i.d., MCMC, random reshuffling) are indeed recurrent under mild assumptions. In this work, we show that for a particular class of stochastic optimization algorithms, we do not need any other property (e.g., independence, exponential mixing, and reshuffling) than recurrence in data sampling algorithms to guarantee the optimal rate of first-order convergence. Namely, using regularized versions of Minimization by Incremental Surrogate Optimization (MISO), we show that for non-convex and possibly non-smooth objective functions, the expected optimality gap converges at an optimal rate $O(n^{-1/2})$ under general recurrent sampling schemes. Furthermore, the implied constant depends explicitly on the `speed of recurrence', measured by the expected amount of time to visit a given data point either averaged (`target time') or supremized (`hitting time') over the current location. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that convergence can be accelerated by selecting sampling algorithms that cover the data set most effectively. We discuss applications of our general framework to decentralized optimization and distributed non-negative matrix factorization.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Complexity Analysis of the First-order Algorithms for Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence rate of various first-order optimization algorithms is a pivotal concern within the numerical optimization community, as it directly reflects the efficiency of these algorithms across different optimization problems. Our goal is making a significant step forward in the formal mathematical representation of optimization techniques using the Lean4 theorem prover. We first formalize the gradient for smooth functions and the subgradient for convex functions on a Hilbert space, laying the groundwork for the accurate formalization of algorithmic structures. Then, we extend our contribution by proving several properties of differentiable convex functions that have not yet been formalized in Mathlib. Finally, a comprehensive formalization of these algorithms is presented. These developments are not only noteworthy on their own but also serve as essential precursors to the formalization of a broader spectrum of numerical algorithms and their applications in machine learning as well as many other areas.</description>

      <title>Combination of Site-Wide and Real-Time Optimization for the Control of Systems of Electrolyzers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy sources has introduced significant volatility and unpredictability in the energy supply chain, necessitating advanced control strategies to ensure grid stability and reliability. Green hydrogen production via electrolysis offers a viable solution for converting and storing this volatile renewable energy. However, the inherent fluctuations of renewable energy sources present challenges for consistent utilization and integration of green hydrogen. This work proposes a two-stage optimization approach, combining site-wide optimization and real-time optimization for managing systems of electrolyzers. By adapting an existing static optimization model, dual use is achieved in both site-wide optimization and real-time optimization. The hierarchical optimization structure, characterized by distinct temporal resolutions, enables effective responses to both dynamic changes and long-term trends. The side-wide optimization layer generates long-term plans based on forecast data, while the real-time optimization layer refines these plans in real-time, accommodating immediate fluctuations and ensuring efficient operation. The results from the case study on a system of electrolyzers demonstrate the method's effectiveness in aligning electrolyzer operation with actual availability of renewable energy. This approach offers a robust framework for optimizing the operation of electrolyzers but also other types of flexible energy resources, contributing to sustainable and economically viable energy management.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Variant of Frank-Wolfe Method for Relative Smooth Convex Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper introduces a new adaptive version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for relatively smooth convex functions. It is proposed to use the Bregman divergence other than half the square of the Euclidean norm in the formula for step-size. Algorithm convergence estimates for minimization problems of relatively smooth convex functions with the triangle scaling property are proved. Computational experiments are performed, and conditions are shown in which the obvious advantage of the proposed algorithm over its Euclidean norm analogue is shown. We also found examples of problems for which the proposed variation of the Frank-Wolfe method works better than known accelerated gradient-type methods for relatively smooth convex functions with the triangle scaling property.</description>

Abstract: The rise of advanced data technologies in electric power distribution systems enables operators to optimize operations but raises concerns about data security and consumer privacy. Resulting data protection mechanisms that alter or obfuscate datasets may invalidate the efficacy of data-driven decision-support tools and impact the value of these datasets to the decision-maker. This paper derives tools for distribution system operators to enrich data-driven operative decisions with information on data quality and, simultaneously, assess data usefulness in the context of this decision. To this end, we derive an AC optimal power flow model for radial distribution systems with data-informed stochastic parameters that internalize a data quality metric. We derive a tractable reformulation and discuss the marginal sensitivity of the optimal solution as a proxy for data value. Our model can capture clustered data provision, e.g., from resource aggregators, and internalize individual data quality information from each data provider. We use the IEEE 33-bus test system, examining scenarios with varying photovoltaic penetration, to demonstrate the application of our approach and discuss the relationship between data quality and its value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for solving linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problems with linear equality constraints, also known as constrained LQR (CLQR) problems. Our method's sequential runtime is linear in the number of stages and constraints, and its parallel runtime is logarithmic in the number of stages. The main technical contribution of this paper is the derivation of parallelizable techniques for eliminating the linear equality constraints while preserving the standard positive (semi-)definiteness requirements of LQR problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study a variational problem providing a way to extend for all times minimizing geodesics connecting two given probability measures, in the Wasserstein space. This is simply obtained by allowing for negative coefficients in the classical variational characterization of Wasserstein barycenters. We show that this problem admits two equivalent convex formulations: the first can be seen as a particular instance of Toland duality and the second is a barycentric optimal transport problem. We propose an efficient numerical scheme to solve this latter formulation based on entropic regularization and a variant of Sinkhorn algorithm.</description>

      <title>Inertial Methods with Viscous and Hessian driven Damping for Non-Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study non-convex minimization problems via second-order (in-time) dynamics, including a non-vanishing viscous damping and a geometric Hessian-driven damping. Second-order systems that only rely on a viscous damping may suffer from oscillation problems towards the minima, while the inclusion of a Hessian-driven damping term is known to reduce this effect without explicit construction of the Hessian in practice. There are essentially two ways to introduce the Hessian-driven damping term: explicitly or implicitly. For each setting, we provide conditions on the damping coefficients to ensure convergence of the gradient towards zero. Moreover, if the objective function is definable, we show global convergence of the trajectory towards a critical point as well as convergence rates. Besides, in the autonomous case, if the objective function is Morse, we conclude that the trajectory converges to a local minimum of the objective for almost all initializations. We also study algorithmic schemes for both dynamics and prove all the previous properties in the discrete setting under proper choice of the step-size.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization and Ambiguity-based Learning of Distributionally Uncertain Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.09111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to construct data-driven online solutions to optimization problems (P) subject to a class of distributionally uncertain dynamical systems. The introduced framework allows for the simultaneous learning of distributional system uncertainty via a parameterized, control-dependent ambiguity set using a finite historical data set, and its use to make online decisions with probabilistic regret function bounds. Leveraging the merits of Machine Learning, the main technical approach relies on the theory of Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), to hedge against uncertainty and provide less conservative results than standard Robust Optimization approaches. Starting from recent results that describe ambiguity sets via parameterized, and control-dependent empirical distributions as well as ambiguity radii, we first present a tractable reformulation of the corresponding optimization problem while maintaining the probabilistic guarantees. We then specialize these problems to the cases of 1) optimal one-stage control of distributionally uncertain nonlinear systems, and 2) resource allocation under distributional uncertainty. A novelty of this work is that it extends DRO to online optimization problems subject to a distributionally uncertain dynamical system constraint, handled via a control-dependent ambiguity set that leads to online-tractable optimization with probabilistic guarantees on regret bounds. Further, we introduce an online version of Nesterov's accelerated-gradient algorithm, and analyze its performance to solve this class of problems via dissipativity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.06194v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate and extend the result that an alpha-weight angle from unconstrained quadratic portfolio optimisations has an upper bound dependent on the condition number of the covariance matrix. This is known to imply that better conditioned covariance matrices produce weights from unconstrained mean-variance optimisations that are better aligned with each assets expected return. Here we relate the inequality between the alpha-weight angle and the condition number to extend the result to include portfolio optimisations with gearing constraints to provide an extended family of robust optimisations. We use this to argue that in general the equally weighted portfolio is not preferable to the mean-variance portfolio even with poor forecast ability and a badly conditioned covariance matrix. We confirm the distribution free theoretical arguments with a simple Gaussian simulation.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling of Continuous Potentials on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gibbs sampling from continuous real-valued functions is a challenging problem of interest in machine learning. Here we leverage quantum Fourier transforms to build a quantum algorithm for this task when the function is periodic. We use the quantum algorithms for solving linear ordinary differential equations to solve the Fokker--Planck equation and prepare a quantum state encoding the Gibbs distribution. We show that the efficiency of interpolation and differentiation of these functions on a quantum computer depends on the rate of decay of the Fourier coefficients of the Fourier transform of the function. We view this property as a concentration of measure in the Fourier domain, and also provide functional analytic conditions for it. Our algorithm makes zeroeth order queries to a quantum oracle of the function. Despite suffering from an exponentially long mixing time, this algorithm allows for exponentially improved precision in sampling, and polynomial quantum speedups in mean estimation in the general case, and particularly under geometric conditions we identify for the critical points of the energy function.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel recursive utility for controlling stochastic processes under risk and uncertainty. Our formulation uses a robustified Orlicz risk that can evaluate risk and uncertainty simultaneously. We focus on a control problem of a photovoltaic power generation system that supplies excess electricity to a secondary purpose for generating green hydrogen. The corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation having a novel nonlinear term is then derived. Computational examples with the available data are finally presented, demonstrating that our methodology can be used for the photovoltaic power generation under different meteorological and operational conditions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm for a heterogeneous platoon using arbitrary communication topologies, provided each vehicle can communicate with a preceding vehicle in the platoon. The proposed DMPC algorithm can accommodate any spacing policy that is affine in a vehicle's velocity, which includes constant distance or constant time headway spacing policies. By analyzing the total cost for the entire platoon, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure platoon asymptotic stability. Simulation experiments with a platoon of 50 vehicles and hardware experiments with a platoon of four 1/10th-scale vehicles validate the algorithm and compare performance under different spacing policies and communication topologies.</description>

      <title>Optimal single threshold stopping rules and sharp prophet inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite horizon optimal stopping problem for a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. The objective is to design stopping rules that attempt to select the random variable with the highest value in the sequence. The performance of any stopping rule may be benchmarked relative to the selection of a "prophet" that has perfect foreknowledge of the largest value. Such comparisons are typically stated in the form of "prophet inequalities." In this paper we characterize sharp prophet inequalities for single threshold stopping rules as solutions to infinite two person zero sum games on the unit square with special payoff kernels. The proposed game theoretic characterization allows one to derive sharp non-asymptotic prophet inequalities for different classes of distributions. This, in turn, gives rise to a simple and computationally tractable algorithmic paradigm for deriving optimal single threshold stopping rules.</description>

      <title>HPPP: Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point Algorithms and Applications to Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preconditioned Proximal Point (PPP) algorithms provide a unified framework for splitting methods in image restoration. Recent advancements with RED (Regularization by Denoising) and PnP (Plug-and-Play) priors have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain, emphasizing the need for a meaningful particular solution. However, degenerate PPP algorithms typically exhibit weak convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, leading to uncertain solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence properties of Halpern iteration to achieve a particular solution. Based on the implicit regularization defined by gradient RED, we further introduce the Gradient REgularization by Denoising via HPPP called GraRED-HP3 algorithm. The HPPP algorithm is shown to have the regularity converging to a particular solution by a toy example. Additionally, experiments in image deblurring and inpainting validate the effectiveness of GraRED-HP3, showing it surpasses classical methods such as Chambolle-Pock (CP), PPP, RED, and RED-PRO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a stochastic predictive control framework for nonlinear systems subject to unbounded process noise with closed-loop guarantees. First, we first provide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general probabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide a tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state and a simple constraint tightening. Both formulations ensure recursive feasibility, satisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the resulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for probabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear systems using stochastic contraction metrics. We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method through a simulation of a chain of mass-spring-dampers with nonlinear Coulomb friction. Overall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable stochastic predictive control approaches with closed-loop guaranteed for nonlinear systems with unbounded noise.</description>
