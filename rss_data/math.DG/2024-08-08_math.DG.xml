      <title>The total Q-curvature, volume entropy and polynomial growth polyharmonic functions (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous work (Advances in Mathematics 450 (2024), Paper No. 109768). In this paper, we characterize complete metrics with finite total Q-curvature as normal metrics for all dimensional cases. Secondly, we introduce another volume entropy to provide geometric information regarding complete non-normal metrics with finite total Q-curvature. In particular, we show that if the scalar curvature is bounded from below, the volume growth of such complete metrics is controlled.</description>

      <title>Complete cohomogeneity one hypersurfaces of $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study isometric immersions $f: M^n \rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ into hyperbolic space of dimension $n+1$ of a complete Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ on which a compact connected group of intrinsic isometries acts with principal orbits of codimension one. We provide a characterization if either $n \geq 3$ and $M^n$ is compact, or $n \geq 5$ and the connected components of the set where the sectional curvature is constant and equal to $-1$ are bounded.</description>

      <title>Geodesics, curvature, and conjugate points on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Lie group equipped with a left-invariant metric, we study the minimizing properties of geodesics through the presence of conjugate points. We give criteria for the existence of conjugate points along steady and nonsteady geodesics, using different strategies in each case. We consider both general Lie groups and quadratic Lie groups, where the metric in the Lie algebra $g(u,v)=\langle u,\Lambda v\rangle$ is defined from a bi-invariant bilinear form and a symmetric positive definite operator $\Lambda$. By way of illustration, we apply our criteria to $SO(n)$ equipped with a generalized version of the rigid body metric, and to Lie groups arising from Cheeger's deformation technique, which include Zeitlin's $SU(3)$ model of hydrodynamics on the $2$-sphere. Along the way we obtain formulas for the Ricci curvatures in these examples, showing that conjugate points occur even in the presence of some negative curvature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-0 fields and conserved charges on n-dimensional Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is polyhomogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In four dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for higher dimensions there is only a finite number of non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>

      <title>On the collapsing of Calabi-Yau manifolds and K\"ahler-Ricci flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.00836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collapsing of Calabi-Yau metrics and of Kahler-Ricci flows on fiber spaces where the base is smooth. We identify the collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the Kahler-Ricci flow when the divisorial part of the discriminant locus has simple normal crossings. In either setting, we also obtain an explicit bound for the real codimension 2 Hausdorff measure of the Cheeger-Colding singular set, and identify a sufficient condition from birational geometry to understand the metric behavior of the limiting metric on the base.</description>

      <title>Flows of geometric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an abstract theory of flows of geometric $H$-structures, i.e., flows of tensor fields defining $H$-reductions of the frame bundle, for a closed and connected subgroup $H\subset SO(n)$, on any connected and oriented $n$-manifold with sufficient topology to admit such structures. The first part of the article sets up a unifying theoretical framework for deformations of $H$-structures, by way of the natural infinitesimal action of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ on tensors combined with various bundle decompositions induced by $H$-structures. We compute evolution equations for the intrinsic torsion under general flows of $H$-structures and, as applications, we obtain general Bianchi-type identities for $H$-structures, and, for closed manifolds, a general first variation formula for the $L^2$-Dirichlet energy functional $\mathcal{E}$ on the space of $H$-structures. We then specialise the theory to the negative gradient flow of $\mathcal{E}$ over isometric $H$-structures, i.e., their harmonic flow. The core result is an almost monotonocity formula along the flow for a scale-invariant localised energy, similar to the classical formulae by Chen-Struwe for the harmonic map heat flow. This yields an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem and an energy gap result for harmonic structures, as well as long-time existence for the flow under small initial energy, relative to the $L^\infty$-norm of initial torsion, in the spirit of Chen-Ding. Moreover, below a certain energy level, the absence of a torsion-free isometric $H$-structure in the initial homotopy class imposes the formation of finite-time singularities. These seemingly contrasting statements are illustrated by examples on flat $n$-tori, so long as $[\mathbb{S}^n,SO(n)/H]$ contains more than one element and the universal cover of $SO(n)/H$ is a sphere; e.g. when $n=7$ and $H=\rm G_2$, or $n=8$ and $H=\rm Spin(7)$.</description>

      <title>The equivalence of smooth and synthetic notions of timelike sectional curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timelike sectional curvature bounds play an important role in spacetime geometry, both for the understanding of classical smooth spacetimes and for the study of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces introduced in \cite{kunzinger2018lorentzian}. In the smooth setting, a bound on the sectional curvature of timelike planes can be formulated via the Riemann curvature tensor. In the synthetic setting, bounds are formulated by comparing various geometric configurations to the corresponding ones in constant curvature spaces. The first link between these notions in the Lorentzian context was established in \cite{harris1982triangle}, which was instrumental in the proof of powerful results in spacetime geometry \cite{beem1985toponogov, beem1985decomposition, galloway2018existence}. For general semi-Riemannian manifolds, the equivalence between sectional curvature bounds and synthetic bounds was established in \cite{alexander2008triangle}, however in this approach the sectional curvatures of both timelike and spacelike planes have to be considered. In this article, we fill a gap in the literature by proving the full equivalence between sectional curvature bounds on timelike planes and synthetic timelike bounds on strongly causal spacetimes. As an essential tool, we establish Hessian comparison for the time separation and signed distance functions.</description>

Abstract: We present new complete Calabi-Yau metrics defined on the complement of a smooth anticanonical divisor with ample normal bundle, approaching the Calabi model space at a polynomial rate. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of this type of Calabi-Yau metric within a fixed cohomology class.</description>

      <title>Balanced metrics and Gauduchon cone of locally conformally Kahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complex Hermitian $n$-manifold $(M,I, \omega)$ is called locally conformally Kahler (LCK) if $d\omega=\theta\wedge\omega$, where $\theta$ is a closed 1-form, balanced if $\omega^{n-1}$ is closed, and SKT if $dId\omega=0$. We conjecture that any compact complex manifold admitting two of these three types of Hermitian forms (balanced, SKT, LCK) also admits a Kahler metric, and prove partial results towards this conjecture. We conjecture that the (1,1)-form $-d(I\theta)$ is Bott--Chern homologous to a positive (1,1)-current. This conjecture implies that $(M,I)$ does not admit a balanced Hermitian metric. We verify this conjecture for all known classes of LCK manifolds.</description>
