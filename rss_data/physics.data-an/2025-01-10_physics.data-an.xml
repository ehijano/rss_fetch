      <title>Large Physics Models: Towards a collaborative approach with Large Language Models and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores ideas and provides a potential roadmap for the development and evaluation of physics-specific large-scale AI models, which we call Large Physics Models (LPMs). These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models. This roadmap provides specific objectives, defines pathways to achieve them, and identifies challenges that must be addressed to realise physics-specific large scale AI models.</description>

      <title>Local predictors of explosive synchronization with ordinal methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to use the ordinal pattern transition (OPT) entropy measured at sentinel central nodes as a potential predictor of explosive transitions to synchronization in networks of various dynamical systems with increasing complexity. Our results demonstrate that the OPT entropic measure surpasses traditional early warning signals (EWS) measures and could be valuable to the tools available for predicting critical transitions. In particular, we investigate networks of diffusively coupled phase oscillators and chaotic R\"ossler systems. As maps, we consider a neural network of Chialvo maps coupled in star and scale-free configurations. Furthermore, we apply this measure to time series data obtained from a network of electronic circuits operating in the chaotic regime.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics of Complex Time-Delays in Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wigner-Smith time-delay of flux conserving systems is a real quantity that measures how long an excitation resides in an interaction region. The complex generalization of time-delay to non-Hermitian systems is still under development, and its statistical properties in the short-wavelength limit of complex chaotic scattering systems have not been investigated. From the experimentally measured multi-port scattering ($S$)-matrices of one-dimensional graphs, a two-dimensional billiard, and a three-dimensional cavity, we calculate the complex Wigner-Smith, as well as each individual reflection and transmission time-delays. The complex reflection time-delay differences between each port are calculated, and the transmission time-delay differences are introduced for systems exhibiting non-reciprocal scattering. Large time-delays are associated with scattering singularities such as coherent perfect absorption, reflectionless scattering, slow light, and uni-directional invisibility. We demonstrate that the large-delay tails of the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of each time-delay quantity are superuniversal, independent of experimental parameters: wave propagation dimension $\mathcal{D}$, number of scattering channels $M$, Dyson symmetry class $\beta$, and uniform attenuation $\eta$. The tails determine the abundance of the singularities in generic scattering systems, and the superuniversality is in direct contrast with the well-established statistics of unitary systems, where the distribution tail depends explicitly on the values of $M$ and $\beta$. We relate the statistics to the topological properties of the corresponding singularities. Although the results presented here are based on classical microwave experiments, they are applicable to any non-Hermitian wave-chaotic scattering system in the short-wavelength limit, such as optical or acoustic resonators.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>
