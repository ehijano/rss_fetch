      <title>An Interpretable Operator-Learning Model for Electric Field Profile Reconstruction in Discharges Based on the EFISH Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have recently been used to reconstruct electric field distributions from EFISH signal profiles-the 'inverse EFISH problem'. This addresses the line-of-sight EFISH inaccuracy caused by the Gouy phase shift in focused beams. A key benefit of this approach is that the accuracy of the reconstructed profile can be directly checked via a 'forward transform' of the EFISH equation. Motivated by this latest success, the present study introduces a novel ML model with markedly improved performance. Based on a more powerful operator-learning architecture, it goes beyond the ANNs and CNNs employed previously. Termed Decoder-DeepONet (DDON), its main strength is learning function-to-function mappings, essential for recovering electric field profiles of unknown shape. The superior performance of DDON is exemplified via a comparison with our published CNN model and the feasibility of a classical mathematical method, as well as its application to both discharge simulations and experimental EFISH data from a nanosecond pulsed discharge. In almost all cases, the DDON model exhibits better generalizability, higher prediction accuracy, and wider applicability. Furthermore, the intrinsic nature of this operator-learning architecture renders it less sensitive to the exact location(s) of the acquired data, enabling electric field reconstruction even with seemingly 'incomplete' input profiles--an issue often accompanying poor signal sensitivity. We also employ Integrated Gradients (IG) to identify the signal regions most critical to reconstruction accuracy, providing guidance on the optimal sampling window for EFISH acquisition. Overall, we believe that the DDON model is a robust and comprehensive model which can be readily applied to reconstruct 'bell-shaped' electric field profiles with an existing axis of symmetry, especially in non-equilibrium plasmas.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of transient heat loads on plasma-facing materials in Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion devices are constantly under the threat of malfunctions coming from the damages of plasma-facing materials due to being affected by thermal heat loads. The frequent heat loads during some transient events in large-scale Tokamaks have always been a great concern for researchers. In ITER, the heat load of GW/m2 is estimated to impose plasma-facing components during edge localized modes, beside the Tokamak steady state load which is about 20 MW/m2. Moreover, there are also other transient thermal loads occurring due to off-normal operation of ITER such as vertical displacement events or disruptions, at the orders of hundreds of MW/m2 and tens of GW/m2, respectively. These loads are great enough to result in severe damages of plasma-facing materials. In this study, the facture of tungsten material under the heat loads of Tokamaks is simulated and the results are presented.</description>

      <title>Edge-localized-mode heat load effects on plasma-facing materials studied using runaway electrons in the Damavand tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge localized modes (ELMs) and runaway electrons (REs) pose significant challenges for all Tokamak devices and act as potent heat sources, potentially shortening the lifespan of plasma-facing materials (PFMs). These thermal loads can manifest in various detrimental effects, including melting, sputtering, cracking, blistering, and other forms of material degradation. While the ELMs are an intrinsic feature of H-mode operation in Tokamaks, runaway electrons pose a potential threat across all Tokamak device scales.In devices such as ITER, even with mitigation strategies, the ELMs can still impose considerable heat loads on the PFMs, reaching levels of approximately 1 MJ/m2. Various methods exist to experimentally simulate the heat load effects of ELMs on PFMs. In this study, the thermal loads from REs in small-scale Tokamaks are considered for this purpose.The presence of small-scale Tokamaks, exemplified by the Damavand experiment, facilitates the investigation of RE energy deposition. Analysis of the experimental data indicates that the REs populations generated by plasma instabilities within the Damavand Tokamak discharges exhibit heat densities on the order of MJ/m2 to 1 cm2 area PFMs. Furthermore, considering an average REs energy of 1 MeV and the prevailing discharge current, calculations indicate that the average total energy of the REs population per discharge is approximately 1 kJ, which is subsequently deposited on the Tokamak limiter. Considering the limiter's surface area and assuming that only 40% of the REs energy is transferred to it, the calculated heat load density reaches the order of MJ/m2, comparable to that observed during the ELMs events in large-scale fusion devices. This correspondence enables the Damavand Tokamak to investigate thermal loas effects of ELMs on PFMs in large-scale Tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Investigation of glow discharge plasma energy distribution using a gridded energy analyzer considering plasma-facing materials related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the effects of glow discharge plasmas on plasma-facing materials and the applications such as coating, cleaning and surface treating, this work has been done to investigate the energy of ions of dc glow discharge plasmas. On the way towards this goal, a plasma chamber has been simulated via COMSOL Multiphysics software. Then, a gridded energy analyzer has been simulated and designed. In the next step, the analyzer has been constructed and tested to measure the energy of plasma ions. The devise contains a grid which is negatively biased to the same potential as the glow discharge cathode electrode. It discriminates plasma ions based on their energies, which are accelerated due to sheath potential drop before colliding with the cathode. The obtained energy distribution function from experiments has been compared to that of simulated plasma. The experimental results show that there are different groups of ions each in local thermal equilibrium in dc glow discharge plasmas.</description>

      <title>Gigagauss magnetic field generation by bladed microtube implosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of ultrahigh magnetic fields in the order of gigagauss using a bladed microtube target whose inner surface is periodically slanted in a sawtooth-like pattern. When irradiated by ultra-intense, ultrashort laser pulses, hot electrons with MeV energies are produced at the outer surface and swiftly transported to the inner surface, initiating a rapid implosion of plasma toward the central axis. The unique blade-induced asymmetry gives rise to vortex-shaped flows of ions and electrons near the center, forming strong azimuthal loop currents that generate ultrahigh magnetic fields at the center. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, supported by a simple analytical model, elucidate the underlying physics and reveal key scaling laws governing the field strength and spatial confinement.</description>

      <title>Generation of giga-electron-volt proton beams by micronozzle acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our proposed ion acceleration scheme, micronozzle acceleration (MNA), generates proton beams with extremely high kinetic energies on the giga-electron-volt (GeV) order. The underlying physics and performance of MNA are studied with two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. In MNA targets, a micron-sized hydrogen rod is embedded inside a hollow micronozzle. Subsequent illumination of the target along the symmetric axis by an ultraintense ultrashort laser pulse forms a strong electrostatic field with a long lifetime and an extensive space around the downstream tail of the nozzle. The electric field significantly amplifies the kinetic energies of the accelerated protons, and &gt; GeV protons are generated at an applied laser intensity of 10^22 W/cm^2 .</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of the Pinch Region of a Deflagration Plasma Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spectroscopic study of a plasma deflagration accelerator was carried out to investigate the temporal evolution of plasma density within the pinch region. A half-meter imaging monochromator, paired with a fast (10 MHz) camera operating at 1 MHz, was used to collect broadened chord-integrated spectral lines from the pinch region of a plasma deflagration device. Specifically, images of the $H_{\beta}$ and the $H_{\alpha}$ lines were taken - with the $H_{\alpha}$ used to find the background continuum. Voigt fits of the Abel inverted H$_{\beta}$ emission lines allowed for determination of the radial profile of the number density in the pinch at intervals of 1 $\mu$s. This provided insight into the formation, growth, and decay of the pinch in both the deflagration and detonation modes of the accelerator. It was found that the maximum density for the deflagration increased from $\sim 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$ 1.4 cm away from the core of the pinch to $\sim 10^{23}$ m$^{-3}$ at the core of the deflagration pinch. In contrast, the detonation pinch featured a broader zone of relatively constant density on the order of $\sim 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$. Furthermore, an energy balance of the plasma in the deflagration pinch and downstream, as informed by prior work, was done to get an estimate of temperatures in the core of the pinch where measurements are not currently possible revealing potential temperatures on the 550 eV in the core of the pinch suggesting departures from some of the assumptions in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Effects of Turbulent Energy Exchange between Electrons and Ions on Global Temperature Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscale turbulence drives not only particle and heat transport but also energy exchange between different particle species. Previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that turbulent energy exchange can exceed collisional exchange in weakly collisional plasmas, and that ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence may hinder ion heating by alpha-heated electrons. In addition, it has been clarified that trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence transfers energy from electrons to ions, thereby enhancing ion heating. In this work, we extend these studies by examining the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles at a steady state using the one-dimensional transport solver GOTRESS. For the case of DIII-D discharge 128913 [A. E. White et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056116 (2008)], turbulent energy exchange has minimal influence on temperature profiles. However, in the case of enhanced electron heating in a DIIID like tokamak plasma, energy transfer from hot electrons to cold ions driven by TEM turbulence becomes comparable to, or even exceeds, the collisional contribution, leading to a significant increase in the ion temperature profile. For ITER Baseline and SPARC standard H-mode scenarios [N.T. Howard et al., Nucl. Fusion 65, 016002(2024), P. Rodriguez Fernandez et al., J. Plasma Phys. 86, 865860503(2020)], the turbulent energy exchange is largely compensated by the collisional one, producing only small effects. These results indicate that the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles in steady state conditions of future fusion reactor scenarios is expected to be negligibly small, although it can become significant in situations such as plasma start up phases, where the heating power is strongly unbalanced between electrons and ions.</description>

      <title>Light drag in nonuniformly moving anisotropic media through the lens of gradient-index optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trajectory of light rays propagating through a nonuniformly moving anisotropic medium is determined by considering the Fresnel drag experienced by the wave at each point along the ray. By showing that symmetries in the velocity field manifest as symmetries in the effective wave index representing the moving medium, methods classically employed to model gradient index media are then used to obtain analytical forms for the ray trajectory. When applied to isotropic media, the results are verified to be consistent with those obtained using an optical (Gordon) metric. The potential of this method to model light rays in anisotropic media is finally demonstrated by considering waves in a nonuniformly moving magnetized plasma, exposing how nonuniform motion and anisotropy can compete with one another.</description>

      <title>Injection and Acceleration of Electrons by Radially Polarized Laser Pulses in a Plasma Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider injection and subsequent acceleration of electrons in narrow plasma channels irradiated by linearly and radially polarized ultraintense laser pulses. Using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we show that radially polarized beams significantly promote electron release from the channel walls and lead to enhanced injection. We compare an f/10 linearly polarized laser beam with two radially polarized cases: one focused more tightly (f/5) to match peak intensity, and one at equal f/10 to capture polarization effects. The radially polarized f/10 case injects approximately one-third more charge than the linearly polarized case, while the f/5 radially polarized case outperforms the linearly polarized one by about a factor of two in terms of maximum electron energy. These results highlight polarization and focusing geometry as key parameters for optimizing laser-driven electron acceleration setups.</description>

      <title>Evolution of ion distribution functions in ionospheric plasmas perturbed by Alfv\'en waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates ion kinetic effects during the parametric decay instability (PDI) of parallel-propagating Alfv\'en waves under plasma conditions characteristic of the Earth's ionosphere. By using a series of hybrid particle-in-cell simulations, we examine the evolution of ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) in ultra-low-beta plasmas. Our numerical campaign systematically explores the dependence on key parameters (plasma beta, pump-wave amplitude and polarization, and ion composition). To emphasize the role of kinetic effects, we choose to trigger the PDI with a dispersive mother wave with wavelength comparable to the ion characteristic inertial length. Our results reveal pronounced nonthermal VDF modifications, including parallel heating and the formation of secondary ion beams, linked to the nonlinear evolution of parametric decay instability. By varying the plasma beta and the pump-wave amplitude, we identify a critical regime where rapid and complete broadening of the velocity distribution function is observed, triggering bidirectional ion acceleration. Notably, simulations modeling realistic ionospheric conditions demonstrate that even low-amplitude Alfv\'enic perturbations can induce significant VDF spreading and ion beam generation, with hydrogen ions exhibiting stronger effects than oxygen. These nonthermal microscopic processes offer a plausible mechanism for particle precipitation in space weather events. This work represents the first comprehensive study with hybrid simulations of PDI-driven ion kinetics in ultra-low-beta plasmas, providing quantitative estimates for the time delay between electromagnetic wave impact and ion VDF modification and new insights into wave-particle interactions that may contribute to ion acceleration, precipitation processes and space plasma dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method of constructing the high-beta (diamagnetic-bubble-like) equilibrium with a population of fast sloshing ions is discussed. Fast ions move along betatron orbits; such ions can arise because of off-axis neutral beam injection. Conservation of the adiabatic invariant of these ions is proposed; a simplified expression for the invariant is presented. Numerical examples of equilibrium with sloshing ions are shown and conservation of the invariant is justified by a direct numerical simulation of motion of fast ions even in the case with beta equal to 1.</description>

      <title>Self-similar multishock implosions for ultrahigh compression of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of self-similar solutions describing ultrahigh compression of a uniform-density target by spherically converging, stacked shock waves. Extending the classical Guderley model, we derive a scaling law for the final density of the form $\rho_{r}/\rho_{0} \propto \hat{P}^{\beta (N-1)}$, where $N$ is the number of shocks, $\hat{P}$ the stage pressure ratio, and $\beta$ a numerical exponent determined by the adiabatic index $\gamma$. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations confirm the validity of this scaling across a broad parameter range. Notably, the relation remains accurate even in the strongly nonlinear regime up to $\hat{P} \sim 70$, well beyond the perturbative limit, highlighting the robustness and practical relevance of the model. Owing to its volumetric geometry, this compression scheme inherently avoids the Rayleigh--Taylor instability, which typically compromises shell-based implosions, and thereby establishes a theoretical benchmark for instability-free compression in inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>Near-field perturbation of laser filament enabling simultaneous far-field THz diagnosis and broadband calculus processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) wave manipulation based on laser filaments-plasma channels formed by femtosecond laser-induced air ionization-has emerged as a promising platform for free-space THz applications. However, in-situ characterization of the spatially confined THz modes within filaments faces significant challenges due to the plasma's ultra-high intensity, which not only hinders direct near-field probing but also limits reliance on indirect far-field reconstruction. Here, we introduce a non-invasive near-field modulation scheme where a metal plate approaches the filament at submillimeter distances (comparable to THz wavelengths), perturbing the dielectric environment to convert the symmetric annular THz mode into an asymmetric state. This controlled transition enables far-field detection of broadband calculus behaviors (first- and second-order differentiation/integration) on time-domain THz waveforms and characteristic spectral transfer functions with 1/f, 1/f^2, f or f^2 dependency (where f is the THz frequency), thereby diagnosing the near-field THz mode confinement. Hence, the proposed approach synergizes near-field modulation efficiency with far-field detection robustness, advancing fundamental understanding of plasma-THz interactions and enabling novel all-optical signal processing for filament-based THz technologies.</description>

      <title>High Gain Fusion Target Design using Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>

Abstract: By returning to the topological basics of fusion target design, Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) is used to specify how to initially configure and drive the optimally entangled topological state, and stabilize that topological state from disruption. This can be applied to all methods; including tokamaks, laser-driven schemes, and pulsed-power driven schemes. This target design philosophy has the potential to yield practical, room temperature targets that could yield up to 10 GJ of energy, driven by as little as 3 MJ of absorbed energy. The genAI is based on the concept of Ubuntu that replaces the Deep Convolutional Neural Network approximation of a functional, with the formula for the generating functional of a canonical transformation from the domain of the canonical field momentums and fields, to the domain of the canonical momentums and coordinates, that is the Reduced Order Model. This formula is a logical process of renormalization, that has the potential to enable Heisenberg's canonical approach to field theory, via calculation of the S-matrix, given observation of the fields. This can be viewed as topological characterization and control of collective, that is complex, systems.</description>
