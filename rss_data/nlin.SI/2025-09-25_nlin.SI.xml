      <title>The Orlov-Schulman symmetries of the Manakov-Santini hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the Orlov-Schulman symmetries for the Manakov-Santini (MS) hierarchy. We give an explicit proof of compatibility of additional symmetries with the basic flows of the MS hierarchy, and consider several simple examples, including the Galilean transformation and scalings. We also present a picture of the Orlov-Schulman symmetries in terms of the dressing scheme based on the Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability and Integrability Signatures in a Periodically Driven Infinite-Range Spin Chain: The Case of Floquet interval $\pi/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.</description>

      <title>Discrete vs. continuous dynamics in biology: When do they align and when do they diverge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many biological systems are governed by difference equations and exhibit discrete-time dynamics. Examples include the size of a population when generations are non-overlapping, and the incidence of a disease when infections are recorded at fixed intervals. For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, continuous-time approximations are frequently employed when small changes occur between discrete time steps.
  Here, we present an approach motivated by exactly soluble discrete time problems. We show that such systems have continuous-time descriptions (governed by differential equations) whose solutions precisely agree, at the discrete times, with the discrete time solutions, irrespective of the size of changes that occur.
  For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, we develop approximate continuous-time models that can, to high accuracy, capture rapid growth and decay. Our approach employs mappings between difference and differential equations, generating functional solutions that exactly or closely preserve the original discrete time behaviour. It uncovers fundamental structural parallels and also distinctions between the difference equation and the `equivalent' differential equation. The findings we present cover both time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous systems.
  For completeness, we also consider discrete-time systems with the most rapid oscillatory behaviour possible, namely a sign change each time step. We show, for exactly soluble cases, that such systems also have a continuous-time description, but that this comes at the expense of generally complex-valued solutions.
  This work has applications in, for example, population genetics, ecology and epidemic modelling. By bridging discrete and continuous representations of a system, it enhances insights/analysis of different types of dynamics.</description>

      <title>$T\bar{T}$ and root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations in four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The four-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) theory provides a systematic procedure for realizing two-dimensional integrable field theories. It is therefore a natural question to ask whether integrable deformations of the theories can be realized in the four-dimensional CS theory. In this work, we study $T\bar{T}$ and root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations of two-dimensional integrable field theories, formulated in terms of dynamical coordinate transformations, within the framework of four-dimensional CS theory coupled to disorder defects. We illustrate our procedure in detail for the degenerate $\mathcal{E}$-model, a specific construction that captures and unifies a broad range of integrable systems, including the principal chiral model.</description>
