      <title>Transport through a lattice with local loss: from quantum dots to lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has studied fermion transport through a finite one-dimensional lattice of quantum dots, with localized particle loss from the central lattice site. The dots at each end of the lattice are connected to macroscopic leads, represented as zero-temperature reservoirs of free fermions with a given potential difference. Here we show how this model represents one limiting case of a larger class of models that can be realized with cold quantum gases in optical lattices. While quantum gas realizations allow many system parameters to be varied, we note limitations from finite size effects, and conclude that quantum dots and quantum gases offer complementary views on transport through lossy finite lattices.</description>

      <title>Ring solids and supersolids in spherical shell-shaped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between the anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interaction and confinement in a curved geometry. We do so through numerical calculations, based on the extended Gross- Pitaevskii equation, to characterize the ground state of a dipolar Bose gas under the effect of a bubble trapping potential. As the scattering length and the number of particles are varied, we observe the emergence of a wide variety of dipolar solids, which consist of arrangements of dipolar droplets along a ring over the equator of the spherical shell confinement. By changing the detuning of the trap, we probe different ring-like supersolid structures with varying number of dipolar clusters, which are unobtainable through conventional trapping settings.</description>

      <title>Probing pair correlations in Fermi gases with Ramsey-Bragg interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transition due to Feedback-induced Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical phase transition from a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.</description>
