      <title>Reliability of characterising coronary artery flow with the flow-split outflow strategy: comparison against the multiscale approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational modelling of coronary haemodynamics, imposing patient-specific flow conditions is paramount, yet often impractical due to resource and time constraints, limiting the ability to perform a large number of simulations particularly for diseased cases. We aimed to compare coronary haemodynamics quantified using a simplified flow-split strategy with varying exponents against the clinically verified but computationally intensive multiscale simulations under both resting and hyperaemic conditions in arteries with varying degrees of stenosis.
  Six patient-specific left coronary artery trees were segmented and reconstructed, including three with severe (&gt;70%) and three with mild (&lt;50%) focal stenoses. Simulations were performed for the entire coronary tree to account for the flow-limiting effects from epicardial artery stenoses. Both a 0D-3D coupled multiscale model and a flow-split approach with four different exponents (2.0, 2.27, 2.33, and 3.0) were used. The resulting prominent haemodynamic metrics were statistically compared between the two methods.
  Flow-split and multiscale simulations did not significantly differ under resting conditions regardless of the stenosis severity. However, under hyperaemic conditions, the flow-split method significantly overestimated the time-averaged wall shear stress by up to 16.8 Pa (p=0.031) and underestimate the fractional flow reserve by 0.327 (p=0.043), with larger discrepancies observed in severe stenoses than in mild ones. Varying the exponent from 2.0 to 3.0 within the flow-split methods did not significantly affect the haemodynamic results (p&gt;0.141).
  Flow-split strategies with exponents between 2.0 and 3.0 are appropriate for modelling stenosed coronaries under resting conditions. Multiscale simulations are recommended for accurate modelling of hyperaemic conditions, especially in severely stenosed arteries.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) with Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Microscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) as a novel method to retrieve the indices of the microscopic propagator which is the probability density function of water displacements due to diffusion within the nervous tissue microstructures. Unlike the Ensemble Average Propagator indices or the Diffusion Tensor Imaging metrics, MPI indices are independent from the mesoscopic organization of the tissue such as the presence of multiple axonal bundle directions and orientation dispersion. As a consequence, MPI indices are more specific to the volumes, sizes, and types of microstructures, like axons and cells, that are present in the tissue. Thus, changes in MPI indices can be more directly linked to alterations in the presence and integrity of microstructures themselves. The methodology behind MPI is rooted on zonal modeling of spherical harmonics, signal simulation, and machine learning regression, and is demonstrated on both synthetic and Human Diffusion MRI data.</description>

      <title>Development of the normalization method for the first large field-of-view plastic-based PET Modular scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography acquisition (PET), sensitivity along a line of response can vary due to crystal geometrical arrangements in the scanner and/or detector inefficiencies, leading to severe artefacts in the reconstructed image. To mitigate these effects, data must be corrected by a set of normalization coefficients applied to each line of response. The J-PET Modular scanner is a PET device made of 50 cm long plastic strips arranged axially, currently in operation at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\'ow (Poland).
  We have implemented a normalization method for the large field-of-view plastic-based J-PET Modular scanner using the component-based approach. We estimated the geometric normalization factors for the J-PET Modular scanner using Monte Carlo simulations. We also analysed the effects of variations in detection efficiency. A dedicated cylindrical phantom was simulated to investigate the impact of various factors on image quality. The image quality was quantified in terms of radial and axial uniformity metrics, and the standard deviation to mean intensity ratio, determined for a set of image slices.
  Without normalization, reconstructions of a uniform cylinder exhibit artefacts. These artefacts were satisfactorily compensated using the normalization factors. Applying geometrical corrections lowers the non-uniformity of the image expressed as a standard deviation-to-mean ratio to a range between 5.5 % to 8.5 %. Computationally, the technique is straightforward to parallelize, making it time-efficient. Preliminary estimates suggest that the method is appropriate for use with long axial field-of-view scanners, such as the total-body J-PET, currently under development at the Jagiellonian University.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Diffusion-Rotation Algorithm for Dose Estimation in Electron Beam Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are state-of-the-art when it comes to dosimetric computations in radiotherapy. However, the execution time of these methods suffers in high-collisional regimes. We address this problem by introducing a kinetic-diffusion particle tracing scheme. This algorithm, first proposed in the context of neutral transport in fusion energy, relies on explicit simulation of the kinetic motion in low-collisional regimes and dynamically switches to motion based on a random walk in high-collisional regimes. The random walk motion maintains the first two moments (mean and variance) of the kinetic motion. We derive an analytic formula for the mean kinetic motion and discuss the addition of a multiple scattering distribution to the algorithm. In contrast to neutral transport, the radiation transfer setting does not readily admit to an analytical expression for the variance of the kinetic motion, and we therefore resort to the use of a lookup table. We test the algorithm for dosimetric computations in radiation therapy on a 2D CT scan of a lung patient. Using a simple particle model, our Python implementation of the algorithm is nearly 33 times faster than an equivalent kinetic simulation at the cost of a small modeling error.</description>

      <title>ReMiDi: Reconstruction of Microstructure Using a Differentiable Diffusion MRI Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose ReMiDi, a novel method for inferring neuronal microstructure as arbitrary 3D meshes using a differentiable diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) simulator. We first implemented in PyTorch a differentiable dMRI simulator that simulates the forward diffusion process using a finite-element method on an input 3D microstructure mesh. To achieve significantly faster simulations, we solve the differential equation semi-analytically using a matrix formalism approach. Given a reference dMRI signal $S_{ref}$, we use the differentiable simulator to iteratively update the input mesh such that it matches $S_{ref}$ using gradient-based learning. Since directly optimizing the 3D coordinates of the vertices is challenging, particularly due to ill-posedness of the inverse problem, we instead optimize a lower-dimensional latent space representation of the mesh. The mesh is first encoded into spectral coefficients, which are further encoded into a latent $\textbf{z}$ using an auto-encoder, and are then decoded back into the true mesh. We present an end-to-end differentiable pipeline that simulates signals that can be tuned to match a reference signal by iteratively updating the latent representation $\textbf{z}$. We demonstrate the ability to reconstruct microstructures of arbitrary shapes represented by finite-element meshes, with a focus on axonal geometries found in the brain white matter, including bending, fanning and beading fibers. Our source code is available online.</description>
