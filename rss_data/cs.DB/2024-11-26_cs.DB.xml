      <title>Runtime-optimized Multi-way Stream Join Operator for Large-scale Streaming data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming computing enables the real-time processing of large volumes of data and offers significant advantages for various applications, including real-time recommendations, anomaly detection, and monitoring. The multi-way stream join operator facilitates the integration of multiple data streams into a single operator, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding by consolidating information from diverse sources. Although this operator is valuable in stream processing systems, its current probe order is determined prior to execution, making it challenging to adapt to real-time and unpredictable data streams, which can potentially diminish its operational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a runtime-optimized multi-way stream join operator that incorporates various adaptive strategies to enhance the probe order during the joining of multi-way data streams. The operator's runtime operation is divided into cycles, during which relevant statistical information from the data streams is collected and updated. Historical statistical data is then utilized to predict the characteristics of the data streams in the current cycle using a quadratic exponential smoothing prediction method. An adaptive optimization algorithm based on a cost model, namely dpPick, is subsequently designed to refine the probe order, enabling better adaptation to real-time, unknown data streams and improving the operator's processing efficiency. Experiments conducted on the TPC-DS dataset demonstrate that the proposed multi-way stream join method significantly outperforms the comparative method in terms of processing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Streaming SQL Multi-Way Join Method for Long State Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming computing effectively manages large-scale streaming data in real-time, making it ideal for applications such as real-time recommendations, anomaly detection, and monitoring, all of which require immediate processing. In this context, the multi-way stream join operator is crucial, as it combines multiple data streams into a single operator, providing deeper insights through the integration of information from various sources. However, challenges related to memory limitations can arise when processing long state-based data streams, particularly in the area of streaming SQL. In this paper, we propose a streaming SQL multi-way stream join method that utilizes the LSM-Tree to address this issue. We first introduce a multi-way stream join operator called UMJoin, which employs an LSM-Tree state backend to leverage disk storage, thereby increasing the capacity for storing multi-way stream states beyond what memory can accommodate. Subsequently, we develop a method for converting execution plans, referred to as TSC, specifically for the UMJoin operator. This method identifies binary join tree patterns and generates corresponding multi-way stream join nodes, enabling us to transform execution plans based on binary joins into those that incorporate UMJoin nodes. This transformation facilitates the application of the UMJoin operator in streaming SQL. Experiments with the TPC-DS dataset demonstrate that the UMJoin operator can effectively process long state-based data streams, even with limited memory. Furthermore, tests on execution plan conversion for multi-way stream join queries using the TPC-H benchmark confirm the effectiveness of the TSC method in executing these conversions.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous I/O -- With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of storage hardware has improved vastly recently, leaving the traditional I/O stack incapable of exploiting these gains due to increasingly large relative overheads. Newer asynchronous I/O APIs, such as io_uring, have significantly improved performance by reducing such overheads, but exhibit limited adoption in practice. In this paper, we discuss the complexities that the usage of these contemporary I/O APIs introduces to applications, which we believe are mostly responsible for their low adoption rate. Finally, we share implications and trade offs made by architectures that may be used to integrate asynchronous I/O into DB applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over a decade there has been a rapid growth in Nigerian educational system particularly higher education. Various institutions have come up both from public and private sector offering many of courses both under and post graduate students. Therefore, rates of students enroll for higher educational institutions in Nigeria have also increased. Hence it is very important to understand the roles play by data mining in analyzing the collected data of students and their academic progression. It is a concern for today's education system and this gap has to be identified and properly addressed to the learning community. Data Mining it helps in various ways to resolve issues face in predictions students and staff performances within Nigerian education system. This paperwork we discuss the roles of Data Mining tools and techniques which can be used effectively in resolving issues in some functional unit of Nigerian tertiary institutions.</description>

      <title>SilentWood: Private Inference Over Gradient-Boosting Decision Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-boosting decision forests, as used by algorithms such as XGBoost or AdaBoost, offer higher accuracy and lower training times for large datasets than decision trees. Protocols for private inference over decision trees can be used to preserve the privacy of the input data as well as the privacy of the trees. However, naively extending private inference over decision trees to private inference over decision forests by replicating the protocols leads to impractical running times. In this paper, we explore extending the private decision inference protocol using homomorphic encryption by Mahdavi et al. (CCS 2023) to decision forests. We present several optimizations that identify and then remove (approximate) duplication between the trees in a forest and hence achieve significant improvements in communication and computation cost over the naive approach. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first private inference protocol for highly scalable gradient-boosting decision forests. Our optimizations extend beyond Mahdavi et al.'s protocol to various private inference protocols for gradient-boosting decision trees. Our protocol's inference time is faster than the baseline of parallel running the protocol by Mahdavi et al.~by up to 28.1x, and faster than Zama's Concrete ML XGBoost by up to 122.25x.</description>

      <title>FineWeb-zhtw: Scalable Curation of Traditional Chinese Text Data from the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality and size of a pretraining dataset significantly influence the performance of large language models (LLMs). While there have been numerous efforts in the curation of such a dataset for English users, there is a relative lack of similar initiatives for Traditional Chinese. Building upon this foundation of FineWeb, we introduce FineWeb-zhtw, a dataset tailored specifically for Traditional Chinese users. We came up with multiple stages of meticulously designed filters to cater to the linguistic difference between English and Traditional Chinese, to ensure comprehensiveness and quality. We determined effectiveness from querying dataset samples with three main objectives. Our code and datasets are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Distributed, communication-efficient, and differentially private estimation of KL divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key task in managing distributed, sensitive data is to measure the extent to which a distribution changes. Understanding this drift can effectively support a variety of federated learning and analytics tasks. However, in many practical settings sharing such information can be undesirable (e.g., for privacy concerns) or infeasible (e.g., for high communication costs). In this work, we describe novel algorithmic approaches for estimating the KL divergence of data across federated models of computation, under differential privacy. We analyze their theoretical properties and present an empirical study of their performance. We explore parameter settings that optimize the accuracy of the algorithm catering to each of the settings; these provide sub-variations that are applicable to real-world tasks, addressing different context- and application-specific trust level requirements. Our experimental results confirm that our private estimators achieve accuracy comparable to a baseline algorithm without differential privacy guarantees.</description>

      <title>AMIDER: A Multidisciplinary Research Database and Its Application to Promote Open Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AMIDER, Advanced Multidisciplinary Integrated-Database for Exploring new Research, is a newly developed research data catalog to demonstrate an advanced database application. AMIDER is characterized as a multidisciplinary database equipped with a user-friendly web application. Its catalog view displays diverse research data at once beyond any limitation of each individual discipline. Some useful functions, such as a selectable data download, data format conversion, and display of data visual information, are also implemented. Further advanced functions, such as visualization of dataset mutual relationship, are also implemented as a preliminary trial. These characteristics and functions are expected to enhance the accessibility to individual research data, even from non-expertized users, and be helpful for collaborations among diverse scientific fields beyond individual disciplines. Multidisciplinary data management is also one of AMIDER's uniqueness, where various metadata schemas can be mapped to a uniform metadata table, and standardized and self-describing data formats are adopted. AMIDER website (https://amider.rois.ac.jp/) had been launched in April 2024. As of July 2024, over 15,000 metadata in various research fields of polar science have been registered in the database, and approximately 500 visitors are viewing the website every day on average. Expansion of the database to further multidisciplinary scientific fields, not only polar science, is planned, and advanced attempts, such as applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to metadata, have also been considered.</description>

      <title>Modyn: Data-Centric Machine Learning Pipeline Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines, datasets are continuously growing. Models must incorporate this new training data to improve generalization and adapt to potential distribution shifts. The cost of model retraining is proportional to how frequently the model is retrained and how much data it is trained on, which makes the naive approach of retraining from scratch each time impractical.
  We present Modyn, a data-centric end-to-end machine learning platform. Modyn's ML pipeline abstraction enables users to declaratively describe policies for continuously training a model on a growing dataset. Modyn pipelines allow users to apply data selection policies (to reduce the number of data points) and triggering policies (to reduce the number of trainings). Modyn executes and orchestrates these continuous ML training pipelines. The system is open-source and comes with an ecosystem of benchmark datasets, models, and tooling. We formally discuss how to measure the performance of ML pipelines by introducing the concept of composite models, enabling fair comparison of pipelines with different data selection and triggering policies. We empirically analyze how various data selection and triggering policies impact model accuracy, and also show that Modyn enables high throughput training with sample-level data selection.</description>

      <title>Shapley Value Computation in Ontology-Mediated Query Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Shapley value, originally introduced in cooperative game theory for wealth distribution, has found use in KR and databases for the purpose of assigning scores to formulas and database tuples based upon their contribution to obtaining a query result or inconsistency. In the present paper, we explore the use of Shapley values in ontology-mediated query answering (OMQA) and present a detailed complexity analysis of Shapley value computation (SVC) in the OMQA setting. In particular, we establish a PF/#P-hard dichotomy for SVC for ontology-mediated queries (T,q) composed of an ontology T formulated in the description logic ELHI_\bot and a connected constant-free homomorphism-closed query q. We further show that the #P-hardness side of the dichotomy can be strengthened to cover possibly disconnected queries with constants. Our results exploit recently discovered connections between SVC and probabilistic query evaluation and allow us to generalize existing results on probabilistic OMQA.</description>
