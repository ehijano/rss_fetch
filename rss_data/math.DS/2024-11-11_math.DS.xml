      <title>KAM Theory for almost-periodic equilibria in one dimensional almost-periodic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional chains of interacting particles subjected to one dimensional almost-periodic media. We formulate and prove two KAM type theorems corresponding to both short-range and long-range interactions respectively. Both theorems presented have an a posteriori format and establish the existence of almost-periodic equilibria. The new part here is that the potential function is given by some almost-periodic function with infinitely many incommensurate frequencies.
  In both cases, we do not need to assume that the system is close to integrable. We will show that if there exists an approximate solution for the functional equations, which satisfies some appropriate non-degeneracy conditions, then a true solution nearby is obtained. This procedure may be used to validate efficient numerical computations.
  Moreover, to well understand the role of almost-periodic media which can be approximated by quasi-periodic ones, we present a different approach -- the step by step increase of complexity method -- to the study of the above results of the almost-periodic models.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing for system identification and predictive control with limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is an industry standard control technique that iteratively solves an open-loop optimization problem to guide a system towards a desired state or trajectory. Consequently, an accurate forward model of system dynamics is critical for the efficacy of MPC and much recent work has been aimed at the use of neural networks to act as data-driven surrogate models to enable MPC. Perhaps the most common network architecture applied to this task is the recurrent neural network (RNN) due to its natural interpretation as a dynamical system. In this work, we assess the ability of RNN variants to both learn the dynamics of benchmark control systems and serve as surrogate models for MPC. We find that echo state networks (ESNs) have a variety of benefits over competing architectures, namely reductions in computational complexity, longer valid prediction times, and reductions in cost of the MPC objective function.</description>

      <title>A chemostat model with variable dilution rate due to biofilm growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real life applications, a continuous culture bioreactor may cease to function properly due to bioclogging which is typically caused by the microbial overgrowth. This is a problem that has been largely overlooked in the chemostat modeling literature, despite the fact that a number of models explicitly accounted for biofilm development inside the bioreactor. In a typical chemostat model, the physical volume of the biofilm is considered negligible when compared to the volume of the fluid. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical consequences of removing such assumption. Specifically, we formulate a novel mathematical model of a chemostat where the increase of the biofilm volume occurs at the expense of the fluid volume of the bioreactor, and as a result the corresponding dilution rate increases reciprocally. We show that our model is well-posed and describes the bioreactor that can operate in three distinct types of dynamic regimes: the washout equilibrium, the coexistence equilibrium, or a transient towards the clogged state which is reached in finite time. We analyze the multiplicity and the stability of the corresponding equilibria. In particular, we delineate the parameter combinations for which the chemostat never clogs up and those for which it clogs up in finite time. We also derive criteria for microbial persistence and extinction. Finally, we present a numerical evidence that a multistable coexistence in the chemostat with variable dilution rate is feasible.</description>

      <title>Reducing data resolution for better super-resolution: Reconstructing turbulent flows from noisy observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A super-resolution (SR) method for the reconstruction of Navier-Stokes (NS) flows from noisy observations is presented. In the SR method, first the observation data is averaged over a coarse grid to reduce the noise at the expense of losing resolution and, then, a dynamic observer is employed to reconstruct the flow field by reversing back the lost information. We provide a theoretical analysis, which indicates a chaos synchronization of the SR observer with the reference NS flow. It is shown that, even with noisy observations, the SR observer converges toward the reference NS flow exponentially fast, and the deviation of the observer from the reference system is bounded. Counter-intuitively, our theoretical analysis shows that the deviation can be reduced by increasing the lengthscale of the spatial average, i.e., making the resolution coarser. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical experiments of two-dimensional NS flows. The numerical experiments suggest that there is a critical lengthscale for the spatial average, below which making the resolution coarser improves the reconstruction.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Conceptual Model for the Coupled ENSO and MJO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is essential to studying climate variabilities and predicting extreme weather events. Here, we develop a stochastic conceptual model for describing the coupled ENSO-MJO phenomenon. The model adopts a three-box representation of the interannual ocean component to characterize the ENSO diversity. For the intraseasonal atmospheric component, a low-order Fourier representation is used to describe the eastward propagation of the MJO. We incorporate decadal variability to account for modulations in the background state that influence the predominant types of El Nino events. In addition to dynamical coupling through wind forcing and latent heat, state-dependent noise is introduced to characterize the statistical interactions among these multiscale processes, improving the simulation of extreme events. The model successfully reproduces the observed non-Gaussian statistics of ENSO diversity and MJO spectra. It also captures the interactions between wind, MJO, and ENSO.</description>

      <title>Infection Pressure on Fish in Cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the question of how to connect predictions by hydrodynamic models of how sea lice move in water to observable measures that count the number of lice on each fish in a cage in the water. This question is important for management and regulation of aquacultural practice that tries to maximise food production and minimise risk to the environment. We do this through a simple rule-based model of interaction between sea lice and caged fish. The model is simple: sea lice can attach and detach from a fish. The model has a novel feature, encoding what is known as a master equation producing a time-series of distributions of lice on fish that one might expect to find if a cage full of fish were placed at any given location. To demonstrate how this works, and to arrive at a rough estimate of the interaction rates, we fit a simplified version of the model with three free parameters to publicly available data about an experiment with sentinel cages in Loch Linnhe in Scotland. Our construction, coupled to the hydrodynamic models driven by surveillance data from industrial farms, quantifies the environmental impact as: what would the infection burden look like in a notional cage at any location and how does it change with time?</description>

      <title>Time-to-reach Bounds for Verification of Dynamical Systems Using the Koopman Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel Koopman spectrum-based reachability verification method for nonlinear systems. Contrary to conventional methods that focus on characterizing all potential states of a dynamical system over a presupposed time span, our approach seeks to verify the reachability by assessing the non-emptiness of estimated time-to-reach intervals without engaging in the explicit computation of reachable set. Based on the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, we reformulate the problem of verifying existence of reachable trajectories into the problem of determining feasible time-to-reach bounds required for system reachability. By solving linear programming (LP) problems, our algorithm can effectively estimate all potential time intervals during which a dynamical system can enter (and exit) target sets from given initial sets over an unbounded time horizon. Finally, we demonstrate our method in challenging settings, such as verifying the reachability between non-convex or even disconnected sets, as well as backward reachability and multiple entries into target sets. Additionally, we validate its applicability in addressing real-world challenges and scalability to high-dimensional systems through case studies in verifying the reachability of the cart-pole and multi-agent consensus systems.</description>

      <title>Shift equivalence relations through the lens of C*-correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of shift equivalence relations from the perspective of C*-bimodule theory. We study emerging shift equivalence relations following work of the second-named author with Carlsen and Eilers, both in terms of adjacency matrices and in terms of their C*-correspondences, and orient them when possible. In particular, we show that if two regular C*-correspondences are strong shift equivalent, then the intermediary C*-correspondences realizing the equivalence may be chosen to be regular. This result provides the final missing piece in answering a question of Muhly, Pask and Tomforde, and is used to confirm a conjecture of Kakariadis and Katsoulis on shift equivalence of C*-correspondences.</description>

      <title>Variational principle of random pressure function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13126v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop a convex analysis approach to random pressure functions of random dynamical systems. Using some convex analysis techniques and functional analysis, we establish a variational principle for random pressure function, which extends Bis et al. work (A convex analysis approach to entropy functions, variational principles and equilibrium states, Comm. Math. Phys. (2022) \textbf{394} 215-256) and Ruelle's work (Statistical mechanics on a compact set with $\mathbb{Z}^{\nu}$ action satisfying expansiveness and specification, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. (1973) \textbf{187} 237-251) to random dynamical systems.
  The present paper provides a strategy of obtaining some proper variational principles for entropy-like quantities of dynamical systems to link the topological dynamics and ergodic theory. As applications, we establish variational principles of maximal pattern entropy and polynomial topological entropy of zero entropy systems of $\mathbb{Z}$-actions, mean dimensions of infinite entropy systems acting by amenable groups and preimage entropy-like quantities of non-convertible random dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Large normalizers of ${\mathbb Z}^{d}$-odometers systems and realization on substitutive subshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a ${\mathbb Z}^{d}$-topological dynamical system $(X, T, {\mathbb Z}^{d})$, an isomomorphism is a self-homeomorphism $\phi : X\to X$ such that for some matrix $M\in {\rm GL}(d,{\mathbb Z})$ and any ${n}\in {\mathbb Z}^{d}$, $\phi\circ T^{{n}}=T^{M{n}}\circ \phi$, where $T^{n}$ denote the self-homeomorphism of $X$ given by the action of ${n}\in {\mathbb Z}^d$. The collection of all the isomorphisms forms a group that is the normalizer of the set of transformations $T^{n}$. In the one-dimensional case, isomorphisms correspond to the notion of flip conjugacy of dynamical systems and by this fact are also called reversing symmetries. These isomorphisms are not well understood even for classical systems. We present a description of them for odometers and more precisely for constant-base ${\mathbb Z}^{2}$-odometers, which is surprisingly not simple. We deduce a complete description of the isomorphisms of some minimal ${\mathbb Z}^{d}$-substitutive subshifts. This enables us to provide the first example known of a minimal zero-entropy subshift with the largest possible normalizer group.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a tutorial about uncertainty quantification (UQ) for those who have no background but are interested in learning more in this area. It exploits many very simple examples, which are understandable to undergraduates, to present the ideas of UQ. Topics include characterizing uncertainties using information theory, UQ in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, UQ via data assimilation, the role of uncertainty in diagnostics, and UQ in advancing efficient modeling. The surprisingly simple examples in each topic explain why and how UQ is essential. Both MATLAB and Python codes are made available for these simple examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Baumslag-Solitar group, we study its space of subgroups from a topological and dynamical perspective. We first determine its perfect kernel (the largest closed subset without isolated points). We then bring to light a natural partition of the space of subgroups into one closed subset and countably many open subsets that are invariant under the action by conjugation. One of our main results is that the restriction of the action to each piece is topologically transitive. This partition is described by an arithmetically defined function, that we call the phenotype, with values in the positive integers or infinity. We eventually study the closure of each open piece and also the closure of their union. We moreover identify in each phenotype a (the) maximal compact invariant subspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By reformulating Wang tiles with tensors, we propose a natural generalization to the probabilistic and quantum setting. In this new framework, we introduce notions of tilings and periodicity directly extending their classical counterparts. In the one dimensional case, we recover the decidability of the generalized domino problem by linking it to the trace characterization of nilpotent matrices. In the two-dimensional case, we provide extension of weak and strong aperiodicity respectively and show the equivalence of those generalized notions, extending the well known equivalence in the classical case. We also exhibit a quantum tile set being aperiodic while its underlying classical tile set is not, proving that quantum interference can suppress periodic patterns and paving the way to the investigation of a new kind of aperiodicity. Finally, we highlight the many new research directions opened by this generalization of Wang tiles, related to (quantum) cellular automata, condensed matter physics, symbolic dynamics and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In discrete schemes, weak KAM solutions may be interpreted as approximations of correctors for some Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the periodic setting. It is known that correctors may not exist in the almost periodic setting. We show the existence of discrete weak KAM solutions for non-degenerate and weakly twist interactions in general. Furthermore, assuming equivariance with respect to a linearly repetitive quasi-periodic set, we completely classify all possible types of weak KAM solutions.</description>

We prove some basic diffeological properties for tiling spaces and analyze two different fiber bundle structures of one-dimensional tiling spaces over the irrational torus. We use the diffeological classification of irrationatl tori which captures their arithmetical escence in order to inherit the diffeological equivalence in the context of tiling spaces.</description>

      <title>Mapping dynamical systems into chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polynomial dynamical systems (DSs) can model a wide range of physical processes. A special subset of these DSs that can model chemical reactions under mass-action kinetics is called chemical dynamical systems (CDSs). A central problem in synthetic biology is to map polynomial DSs into dynamically similar CDSs. In this paper, we introduce the quasi-chemical map (QCM) that can systematically solve this problem. The QCM introduces suitable state-dependent perturbations into any given polynomial DS which then becomes a CDS under sufficiently large translations of variables. This map preserves robust features, such as generic equilibria and limit cycles, as well as temporal properties, such as periods of oscillations. Furthermore, the resulting CDSs are at most one degree higher than the original DSs. We demonstrate the QCM by designing relatively simple CDSs with exotic dynamics and bifurcations, and addressing Hilbert's 16th problem in chemistry.</description>

      <title>One dimensional energy cascades in a fractional quasilinear NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer of energy to high frequencies in a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with sublinear dispersion, on the one dimensional torus. We exhibit initial data undergoing finite but arbitrary large Sobolev norm explosion: their initial norm is arbitrary small in Sobolev spaces of high regularity, but at a later time becomes arbitrary large. We develop a novel mechanism producing instability, which is based on extracting, via paradifferential normal forms, an effective equation driving the dynamics whose leading term is a non-trivial transport operator with non-constant coefficients. We prove that such operator is responsible for energy cascades via a positive commutator estimate inspired by Mourre's commutator theory.</description>

      <title>H\"older curves with exotic tangent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important implication of Rademacher's Differentiation Theorem is that every Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$ infinitesimally looks like a line at almost all of its points in the sense that at $\mathcal{H}^1$-almost every point of $\Gamma$, the only tangent to $\Gamma$ is a straight line through the origin. In this article, we show that, in contrast, the infinitesimal structure of H\"older curves can be much more extreme. First we show that for every $s&gt;1$ there exists a $(1/s)$-H\"older curve $\Gamma_s$ in a Euclidean space with $\mathcal{H}^s(\Gamma_s)&gt;0$ such that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many topologically distinct tangents. Second, we study the tangents of self-similar connected sets (which are canonical examples of H\"older curves) and prove that the curves $\Gamma_s$ have the additional property that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many homeomorphically distinct tangents to $\Gamma_s$ which are not admitted as (not even bi-Lipschitz to) tangents to any self-similar set at typical points.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to Lagrangian Poincar\'e recurrence in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterexamples to Lagrangian Poincar\'e recurrence were recently found in dimensions $\geq 6$ by Bro\'ci\'c and Shelukhin. We construct counterexamples in dimension 4 using almost toric fibrations.</description>
