      <title>$(t,r)$ Broadcast Domination Numbers and Densities of the Truncated Square Tiling Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a pair of positive integer parameters $(t,r)$, a subset $T$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is said to $(t,r)$ broadcast dominate a graph $G$ if, for any vertex $u$ in $G$, we have $\sum_{v\in T, u\in N_t(v)}(t-d(u,v))\geq r$, where where $N_{t}(v)=\{u\in V:d(u,v)&lt;t\}$ and $d(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$. This can be interpreted as each vertex $v$ of $T$ sending $\max(t-\text{d}(u,v),0)$ signal to vertices within a distance of $t-1$ away from $v$. The signal is additive and we require that every vertex of the graph receives a minimum reception $r$ from all vertices in $T$. For a finite graph the smallest cardinality among all $(t,r)$ broadcast dominating sets of a graph is called the $(t,r)$ broadcast domination number. We remark that the $(2,1)$ broadcast domination number is the domination number and the $(t,1)$ (for $t\geq 1$) is the distance domination number of a graph.
  We study a family of graphs that arise as a finite subgraph of the truncated square titling, which utilizes regular squares and octagons to tile the Euclidean plane. For positive integers $m$ and $n$, we let $H_{m,n}$ be the graph consisting of $m$ rows of $n$ octagons (cycle graph on $8$ vertices). For all $t\geq 2$, we provide lower and upper bounds for the $(t,1)$ broadcast domination number for $H_{m,n}$ for all $m,n\geq 1$. We give exact $(2,1)$ broadcast domination numbers for $H_{m,n}$ when $(m,n)\in\{(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2)\}$. We also consider the infinite truncated square tiling, denoted $H_{\infty,\infty}$, and we provide constructions of infinite $(t,r)$ broadcasts for $(t,r)\in\{(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(4,1)\}$. Using these constructions we give upper bounds on the density of these broadcasts i.e., the proportion of vertices needed to $(t,r)$ broadcast dominate this infinite graph. We end with some directions for future study.</description>

      <title>Partitions and elementary symmetric polynomials -- an experimental approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a partition $\lambda$, we write $e_j(\lambda)$ for the $j^{\textrm{th}}$ elementary symmetric polynomial $e_j$ evaluated at the parts of $\lambda$ and $e_jp_A(n)$ for the sum of $e_j(\lambda)$ as $\lambda$ ranges over the set of partitions of $n$ with parts in $A$. For $e_jp_A(n)$, we prove analogs of the classical formula for the partition function, $p(n)=1/n \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\sigma_1(n-k)p(k)$, where $\sigma_1$ is the sum of divisors function. We prove several congruences for $e_2p_4(n)$, the sum of $e_2$ over the set of partitions of $n$ into four parts. Define the function $\textrm{pre}_j(\lambda)$ to be the multiset of monomials in $e_j(\lambda)$, which is itself a partition. If $\mathcal A$ is a set of partitions, we define $\textrm{pre}_j(\mathcal A)$ to be the set of partitions $\textrm{pre}_j(\lambda)$ as $\lambda$ ranges over $\mathcal A$. If $\mathcal P(n)$ is the set of all partitions of $n$, we conjecture that the number of odd partitions in $\textrm{pre}_2(\mathcal P(n))$ is at least the number of distinct partitions. We prove some results about $\textrm{pre}_2(\mathcal B(n))$, where $\mathcal B(n)$ is the set of binary partitions of $n$. We conclude with conjectures on the log-concavity of functions related to $e_jp(n)$, the sum of $e_j(\lambda)$ for all $\lambda\in \mathcal P(n)$.</description>

      <title>Transition matrices and Pieri-type rules for polysymmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asvin G and Andrew O'Desky recently introduced the graded algebra P$\Lambda$ of polysymmetric functions as a generalization of the algebra $\Lambda$ of symmetric functions. This article develops combinatorial formulas for some multiplication rules and transition matrix entries for P$\Lambda$ that are analogous to well-known classical formulas for $\Lambda$. In more detail, we consider pure tensor bases $\{s^{\otimes}_{\tau}\}$, $\{p^{\otimes}_{\tau}\}$, and $\{m^{\otimes}_{\tau}\}$ for P$\Lambda$ that arise as tensor products of the classical Schur basis, power-sum basis, and monomial basis for $\Lambda$. We find expansions in these bases of the non-pure bases $\{P_{\delta}\}$, $\{H_{\delta}\}$, $\{E^+_{\delta}\}$, and $\{E_{\delta}\}$ studied by Asvin G and O'Desky. The answers involve tableau-like structures generalizing semistandard tableaux, rim-hook tableaux, and the brick tabloids of E\u{g}ecio\u{g}lu and Remmel. These objects arise by iteration of new Pieri-type rules that give expansions of products such as $s^{\otimes}_{\sigma}H_{\delta}$, $p^{\otimes}_{\sigma}E_{\delta}$, etc.</description>

      <title>Colouring a graph with position sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a colouring version of the general position problem. The \emph{$\gp $-chromatic number} is the smallest number of colours needed to colour $V(G)$ such that each colour class has the no-three-in-line property. We determine bounds on this colouring number in terms of the diameter, general position number, size, chromatic number, cochromatic number and total domination number and prove realisation results. We also determine it for several graph classes, including Kneser graphs $K(n,2)$, line graphs of complete graphs, complete multipartite graphs, block graphs and Cartesian products. We also show that the $\gp $-colouring problem is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Partitioning perfect graphs into comparability graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how many comparability subgraphs are needed to partition the edge set of a perfect graph. We show that many classes of perfect graphs can be partitioned into (at most) two comparability subgraphs and this holds for almost all perfect graphs. On the other hand, we prove that for interval graphs an arbitrarily large number of comparability subgraphs might be necessary.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial invariants for certain classes of non-abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the study of zero-sum invariants of finite non-abelian groups. We address two main problems: the first centers on the ordered Davenport constant and the second on Gao's constant. We establish a connection between the ordered Davenport constant and the small Davenport constant for a finite non-abelian group of even order, which in turn gives a relation with the Noether number. Additionally, we confirm a conjecture of Gao and Li for a non-abelian group of order $2p^{\alpha}$, where $p$ is a prime. Furthermore, we prove a conjecture that connects the ordered Davenport constant to the Loewy length for certain classes of finite $2$-groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13589v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the combinatorial properties of three classes of integer partitions: (1) $s$-modular partitions, a class consisting of partitions into parts with a number of occurrences (i.e., multiplicity) congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo $s$, (2) $s$-congruent partitions, which generalize Sellers' partitions into parts not congruent to $2$ modulo $4$, and (3) $s$-duplicate partitions, of which the partitions having distinct odd parts and enumerated by the function $\mypod(n)$ are a special case. In this vein, we generalize Alladi's series expansion for the product generating function of $\mypod(n)$ and show that Andrews' generalization of G\"ollnitz-Gordon identities coincides with the number of partitions into parts simultaneously $s$-congruent and $t$-distinct (parts appearing fewer than $t$ times).</description>

      <title>On $q$-deformed cubic equations: the quantum heptagon and nonagon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent notion of $q$-deformed irrational numbers is characterized by the invariance with respect to the action of the modular group $\PSL(2,\Z)$, or equivalently under the Burau representation of the braid group~$B_3$. The theory of $q$-deformed quadratic irrationals and quadratic equations with integer coefficients is known and entirely based on this invariance. In this paper, we consider the case of cubic irrationals. We show that irreducible cubic equations with three distinct real roots and cyclic Galois group~$C_3$ (or $\Z/3\Z$) acting by a third order element of $\PSL(2,\Z)$, have a canonical $q$-deformation, that we describe. This class of cubic equations contains well-known examples including the equations that describe regular $7$- and $9$-gons.</description>

      <title>Vertex-transitive Neumaier graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $\Gamma$ is called edge-regular whenever it is regular and for any two adjacent vertices the number of their common neighbors is independent of the choice of vertices. A clique $C$ in $\Gamma$ is called regular whenever for any vertex out of $C$, the number of its neighbors in $C$ is independent of the choice of vertex. A Neumaier graph is a non-complete edge-regular graph with a regular clique. In this paper, we study vertex-transitive Neumaier graphs. We give a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vertex-transitive Neumaier graph is strongly regular. We also identify Neumaier Cayley graphs with small valency at most $10$ among vertex-transitive Neumaier graphs.</description>

We give a completely elementary proof for the problem in $\mathbb{Z}$ and some partial results that contributes to the elementary proof of the problem in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, avoiding the usage of the powerful polynomial method and the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An undirected graph is said to be cordial if there is a friendly (0,1)-labeling of the vertices that induces a friendly (0,1)-labeling of the edges. An undirected graph $G$ is said to be $(2,3)$-orientable if there exists a friendly (0,1)-labeling of the vertices of $G$ such that about one third of the edges are incident to vertices labeled the same. That is, there is some digraph that is an orientation of $G$ that is $(2,3)$-cordial. Examples of the smallest noncordial/non-$(2,3)$-orientable graphs are given and upper bounds on the possible number of edges in a cordial/$(2,3)$-orientable graph are presented. It is also shown that if $T$ is a linear operator on the set of all undirected graphs on $n$ vertices that strongly preserves the set of cordial graphs or the set of $(2,3)$-orientable graphs then $T$ is a vertex permutation..</description>

      <title>Stirling numbers for complex reflection groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we defined and studied q-analogues of the Stirling numbers of both types for the Coxeter group of type B. In the present work, we show how this approach can be extended to all irreducible complex reflection groups G. The Stirling numbers of the first and second kind are defined via the Whitney numbers of the first and second kind, respectively, of the intersection lattice of G. For the groups G(m,p,n), these numbers and polynomials can be given combinatorial interpretations in terms of various statistics. The ordered version of ths q-Stirling numbers of the second kind also show up in conjectured Hilbert series for certain super coinvariant algebras.</description>

      <title>The Basis of Foot-Sortable Sock Orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sock ordering is a finite string of elements, each of which has a color. Foot-sorting is a non-deterministic sorting algorithm with the aim of grouping all socks of the same color together, under the constraints of a stack structure; a sock ordering is foot-sortable if there is some way to apply the foot-sorting algorithm such that this aim is realizable. In introducing sock orderings and the foot-sorting algorithm, Defant and Kravitz ask whether there is some list of patterns which all foot-sortable sock orderings must avoid, thus characterizing which sock orderings are foot-sortable. We enumerate this list, the basis of foot-sortable sock orderings, and show that this basis is infinite. We also describe a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for sorting socks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Garsia and Gessel constructed innovative bijections to obtain multivariate generating functions of permutation statistics. In 2011, Biaogioli and Zeng successfully derived four and six variate distributions on the set of wreath product. In this paper, we will generalize the four variate identities from BZ to any positive dominant ordering. And we will simplify the six variate distribution function under the ordering originally defined by Adin and Roichman in 2001.</description>

Abstract: In [Adv. Math., 321 (2017) 269-286], using the theory of ultrafilters, J. H. Johnson Jr., and F. K. Richter proved the nilpotent polynomial Hales-Jewett theorem. Using this result they proved the restricted version of the van der Waerden theorem for nilprogressions of rank $2$ and conjectured that this result must hold for arbitrary rank. In this article, we give an affirmative answer to their conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an number of complete bipartite graphs with bounded matching number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph $G$ is $\mathscr{F}$-free if $G$ does not contain any $F\in \mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. The Tur\'an number $ex(n, \mathscr{F})$ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $\mathscr{F}$-free graph. Let $M_{s}$ be the matching consisting of $ s $ independent edges. Recently, Alon and Frank determined the exact value of $ex(n,\{K_{m},M_{s+1}\})$. Gerbner obtained several results about $ex(n,\{F,M_{s+1}\})$ when $F$ satisfies certain proportions. In this paper, we determine the exact value of $ex(n,\{K_{l,t},M_{s+1}\})$ when $s, n$ are large enough for every $3\leq l\leq t$. When $n$ is large enough, we also show that $ex(n,\{K_{2,2}, M_{s+1}\})=n+{s\choose 2}-\left\lceil\frac{s}{2}\right\rceil$ for $s\ge 12$ and $ex(n,\{K_{2,t},M_{s+1}\})=n+(t-1){s\choose 2}-\left\lceil\frac{s}{2}\right\rceil$ when $t\ge 3$ and $s$ is large enough.</description>

      <title>On the pseudorandomness of Parry--Bertrand automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation measure is a testimony of the pseudorandomness of a sequence $\infw{s}$ and provides information about the independence of some parts of $\infw{s}$ and their shifts. Combined with the well-distribution measure, a sequence possesses good pseudorandomness properties if both measures are relatively small. In combinatorics on words, the famous $b$-automatic sequences are quite far from being pseudorandom, as they have small factor complexity on the one hand and large well-distribution and correlation measures on the other. This paper investigates the pseudorandomness of a specific family of morphic sequences, including classical $b$-automatic sequences. In particular, we show that such sequences have large even-order correlation measures; hence, they are not pseudorandom. We also show that even- and odd-order correlation measures behave differently when considering some simple morphic sequences.</description>

      <title>An asymmetric version of Elekes-Szab\'o via group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalisation of the Elekes-Szab\'o Theorem on the existence of large intersections of a complex variety $V\subseteq W_1\times W_2\times W_3$ with finite grids $A\times B\times C$. We arrive at the same conclusion that $V$ is essentially addition in a commutative algebraic group, but we weaken the assumptions. Firstly, we allow arbitrarily unbalanced cardinalities $|A|^\epsilon= O(|B|)$. Secondly, we remove the assumption that $V$ projects dominantly onto $W_1\times W_3$. Thirdly, we weaken the general position assumption on $B$. As a corollary, we generalise the Elekes-R\'onyai Theorem to an arbitrarily unbalanced version, and more generally to the case of finite families $F$ of univariate polynomials exhibiting non-expansion $|\bigcup_{f\in F}f(A)|= O(|A|^{1+\eta})$ of their action on a finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>Looking for all solutions of the Max Atom Problem (MAP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This present paper provides the absolutely necessary corrections to the previous work entitled {\it A polynomial Time Algorithm to Solve The Max-atom Problem} (arXiv:2106.08854v1). The max-atom-problem (MAP) deals with system of scalar inequalities (called atoms or max-atom) of the form: $x \leq a + \max(y,z)$. Where $a$ is a real number and $x,y$ and $z$ belong to the set of the variables of the whole MAP. A max-atom is said to be positive if its scalar $a$ is $\geq 0$ and stricly negative if its scalar $a &lt;0$. A MAP will be said to be positive if all atoms are positive. In the case of non positive MAP we present a saturation principle for system of vectorial inequalities of the form $x \leq A x + b$ in the so-called $(\max,+)$-algebra assuming some properties on the matrix $A$. Then, we apply such principle to explore all non-trivial solutions (ie $\neq -\infty$). We deduce a strongly polynomial method to express all solutions of a non positive MAP. In the case a positive MAP which has always the vector $x^{1}=(0)$ as trivial solution we show that looking for all solutions requires the enumeration of all elementary circuits in a graph associated with the MAP. However, we propose a strongly polynomial method wich provides some non trivial solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bigraph $G$ is weakly norming if the $e(G)$th root of the density of $G$ in $\lvert W\rvert$ is a norm in the space of bounded measurable functions $W\colon\Omega\times\Lambda\to\mathbb{R}$. The only known technique, due to Conlon--Lee, to show that a bigraph $G$ is weakly norming is to present a cut-percolation sequence of $G$.
  In this paper, we identify a key obstacle for cut-percolation, which we call fold-stability and we show that existence of a cut-percolating of a bigraph $G$ is equivalent to non-existence of non-monochromatic fold-stable colorings of the edges of $G$.</description>

Abstract: In Terao [24], Hiroaki Terao defined and studied "admissible map", which is a generalization of "social welfare function" in the context of hyperplane arrangements. Using this, he proved a generalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem using combinatorial arguments. This paper provides another proof of this generalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, using the idea of algebraic topology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the concept of star clusters in simplicial complexes, which was introduced by Barmak in 2013, by relating it with the structure of hypergraphs that correspond to the simplicial complexes. This implies that for a hypergraph $H$ with a vertex $v$ that is not isolated and not contained in an induced Berge cycle of length $3$, there exists a hypergraph $H'$ with fewer vertices than $H$ such that the independence complex of $H$ is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of the independence complex of $H'$. As an application, we also prove that if a hypergraph has no Berge cycle of length $0$ mod $3$, then the sum of all reduced Betti numbers of its independence complex is at most $1$.</description>

      <title>On the cross-correlation of Golomb Costas permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the most interesting case of safe prime powers $q$, G\'omez and Winterhof showed that a subfamily of the family of Golomb Costas permutations of $\{1,2,\ldots,q-2\}$ of size $\varphi(q-1)$ has maximal cross-correlation of order of magnitude at most $q^{1/2}$. In this paper we study a larger family of Golomb Costas permutations and prove a weaker bound on its maximal cross-correlation. Considering the whole family of Golomb Costas permutations we show that large cross-correlations are very rare. Finally, we collect several conditions for a small cross-correlation of two Costas permutations. Our main tools are the Weil bound and the Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem for finite fields.</description>

      <title>Complex analogues of the Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture and central transversal theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture is a broad generalization of Tverberg's classical theorem. One of its consequences, the central transversal theorem, extends both the centerpoint theorem and the ham sandwich theorem. In this manuscript, we establish complex analogues of these results where the corresponding transversals are complex affine spaces. The proof of the complex Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture for powers of the same prime relies on the non-vanishing of an equivariant Euler class. Additionally, we obtain new Borsuk--Ulam-type theorems on complex Stiefel manifolds, which are interesting on their own. These theorems yield complex analogues of recent extensions of the ham sandwich theorem for mass assignments by Axelrod-Freed and Sober\'on, and provide a direct proof of the complex central transversal theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove specific biases in the number of occurrences of parts belonging to two different residue classes $a$ and $b$, modulo a fixed non-negative integer $m$, for the sets of unrestricted partitions, partitions into distinct parts, and overpartitions. These biases follow from inequalities for residue-weighted partition functions for the respective sets of partitions. We also establish asymptotic formulas for the numbers of partitions of size $n$ that belong to these sets of partitions and have a symmetric residue bias (i.e., for $1\le a&lt;m/2$ and $b=m-a$), as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Equitable Dominator Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new variant of domination-related coloring of graphs, which is a combination of their dominator coloring and equitable coloring called the equitable dominator coloring. An equitable coloring is a proper coloring in which the number of vertices in each color class differs by at most one. In this newly introduced coloring, an additional condition of equitability is added to the existing concept of dominator coloring. The minimum number of colors used in this coloring is called the equitable dominator chromatic number, represented by $\chi_{ed}(G)$. The concept of equitable dominator coloring is explored for basic graph classes. The equitable dominator chromatic number is obtained for the same and some observations on the bounds are made in this paper.</description>

Abstract: A proper vertex coloring of the graph $G$ such that each vertex dominates at least one color class and the cardinalities of the color classes differ by at most $1$ is called an equitable dominator coloring of $G$. The minimum number of colors used in this coloring is called the equitable dominator chromatic number (EDCN), represented by $\chi_{ed}(G)$. This article explores the concept of equitable dominator coloring for the line graph $L(G)$ of some graph classes.</description>

We also show that the star graph $K_{1, n-1}$ with $n\geq 3$ has a nonsymmetric CQF for all labelings. Classifying all labeled trees with a symmetric CQF remains an open question.</description>

      <title>A determinant formula of the Jones polynomial for a family of braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2012, Cohen, Dasbach, and Russell presented an algorithm to construct a weighted adjacency matrix for a given knot diagram. In the case of pretzel knots, it is shown that after evaluation, the determinant of the matrix recovers the Jones polynomial. Although the Jones polynomial is known to be #P-hard by Jaeger, Vertigan, and Welsh, this presents a class of knots for which the Jones polynomial can be computed in polynomial time by using the determinant. In this paper, we extend these results by recovering the Jones polynomial as the determinant of a weighted adjacency matrix for certain subfamilies of the braid group. Lastly, we compute the Kauffman polynomial of (2,q) torus knots in polynomial time using the balanced overlaid Tait graphs. This is the first known example of generalizing the methodology of Cohen to a class of quantum invariants which cannot be derived from the HOMFLYPT polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14046v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power, and $d$ a positive integer. We study the proportion of irreducible characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n,q)$ whose values evaluated on a fixed matrix $g$ are divisible by $d$. As $n$ approaches infinity, this proportion tends to $1$ when $q$ is coprime to $d$. When $q$ and $d$ are not coprime, and $g=1$, this proportion is bounded above by $\frac{1}{q}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for a finite set of points $X$ in the projective $n$-space over any field, the Betti number $\beta_{n,n+1}$ of the coordinate ring of $X$ is non-zero if and only if $X$ lies on the union of two planes whose sum of dimension is less than $n$. Our proof is direct and short, and the inductive step rests on a combinatorial statement that works over matroids.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of Order-Divisor Graphs of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the properties of order-divisor graphs associated with finite groups. An order-divisor graph of a finite group is an undirected graph in which the set of vertices includes all elements of the group, and two distinct vertices with different orders are adjacent if the order of one vertex divides the order of the other. We prove some beautiful results in order-divisor graphs of finite groups. The primary focus is on examining the girth, degree of vertices, and size of the order-divisor graph. In particular, we provide a comprehensive description of these parameters for the order-divisor graphs of finite cyclic groups and dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>Explicit bounds for Bell numbers and their ratios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behavior of Bell numbers, enhancing and unifying various results previously dispersed in the literature. We establish several explicit lower and upper bounds. The main results correspond to two asymptotic forms expressed by means of the Lambert $W$ function. As an application, some straightforward elementary bounds are derived. Additionally, an absolute convergence rate of the ratio of the consecutive Bell numbers is derived. The main challenge was to obtain satisfactory constants, as the Bell numbers grow rapidly, while the convergence rates are rather slow.</description>

      <title>Bounding the number of reticulation events for displaying multiple trees in a phylogenetic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing a parsimonious phylogenetic network that displays multiple phylogenetic trees is an important problem in theory of phylogenetics, where the complexity of the inferred networks is measured by reticulation numbers. The reticulation number for a set of trees is defined as the minimum number of reticulations in a phylogenetic network that displays those trees. A mathematical problem is bounding the reticulation number for multiple trees over a fixed number of taxa. While this problem has been extensively studied for two trees, much less is known about the upper bounds on the reticulation numbers for three or more arbitrary trees. In this paper, we present a few non-trivial upper bounds on reticulation numbers for three or more trees.</description>

      <title>Monotone Arc Diagrams with few Biarcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every planar graph has a monotone topological 2-page book embedding where at most (4n-10)/5 (of potentially 3n-6) edges cross the spine, and every edge crosses the spine at most once; such an edge is called a biarc. We can also guarantee that all edges that cross the spine cross it in the same direction (e.g., from bottom to top). For planar 3-trees we can further improve the bound to (3n-9)/4, and for so-called Kleetopes we obtain a bound of at most (n-8)/3 edges that cross the spine. The bound for Kleetopes is tight, even if the drawing is not required to be monotone. A Kleetope is a plane triangulation that is derived from another plane triangulation T by inserting a new vertex v_f into each face f of T and then connecting v_f to the three vertices of f.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study, in greater detail than before, J.H. Conway's topographs for integer binary quadratic forms. These are trees in the plane with regions labeled by integers following a simple pattern. Each topograph can display the values of a single form, or represent an equivalence class of forms. We give a new treatment of reduction of forms to canonical equivalence class representatives by employing topographs and a novel continued fraction for complex numbers. This allows uniform reduction for any positive, negative, square or non-square discriminant. Topograph geometry also provides new class number formulas, and short proofs of results of Gauss relating to sums of three squares. Generalizations of the infinite series of Hurwitz for class numbers give evaluations of certain infinite series, summed over the regions labels or edge labels of a topograph.</description>

      <title>Whirling injections, surjections, and other functions between finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.02411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a certain action called "whirling" that can be defined on any family of functions between two finite sets equipped with a linear (or cyclic) ordering. Many maps of interest in dynamical algebraic combinatorics, such as rowmotion of order ideals, can be represented as a composition of "toggling" involutions, each of which modifies its object only locally. Similarly whirling is made up of locally-acting whirling maps which directly generalize toggles, but cycle through more than two possible outputs. In this first paper on whirling, we consider it as a map on subfamilies of functions between finite sets.
  For whirling acting on the set of injections or the set of surjections, we prove that within each whirling orbit, any two elements of the codomain appear as outputs of functions the same number of times. This result can be stated in terms of the homomesy phenomenon, which occurs when a statistic has the same average across every orbit. We further explore homomesy results and conjectures for whirling on restricted-growth words, which correspond to set partitions. These results extend the collection of combinatorial objects for which we have interesting dynamics and homomesy, and open the door to considering whirling in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Shellability of face posets of electrical networks and the CW poset property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.06217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Thomas Lam that the face posets of stratified spaces of planar resistor networks are shellable. These posets are called uncrossing partial orders. This shellability result combines with Lam's previous result that these same posets are Eulerian to imply that they are CW posets, namely that they are face posets of regular CW complexes. Certain subsets of uncrossing partial orders are shown to be isomorphic to type A Bruhat order intervals; our shelling is shown to coincide on these intervals with a Bruhat order shelling which was constructed by Matthew Dyer using a reflection order.
  Our shelling for uncrossing posets also yields an explicit shelling for each interval in the face posets of the edge product spaces of phylogenetic trees, namely in the Tuffley posets, by virtue of each interval in a Tuffley poset being isomorphic to an interval in an uncrossing poset. This yields a more explicit proof of the result of Gill, Linusson, Moulton and Steel that the CW decomposition of Moulton and Steel for the edge product space of phylogenetic trees is a regular CW decomposition.</description>

Abstract: We describe an implementation of a computer search for the "small" excluded minors for a class of matroids representable over a partial field. Using these techniques, we enumerate the excluded minors on at most 15 elements for both the class of dyadic matroids, and the class of 2-regular matroids. We conjecture that there are no other excluded minors for the class of 2-regular matroids; whereas, on the other hand, we show that there is a 16-element excluded minor for the class of dyadic matroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ayyer and Linusson studied correlations in the multispecies TASEP on a ring (Trans AMS, 2017) using a combinatorial analysis of the multiline queues construction defined by Ferrari and Martin (AOP, 2008). It is natural to explore whether an analogous application of appropriate multiline queues could give similar results for the partially asymmetric case. In this paper, we solve this problem of correlations of adjacent particles on the first two sites in the multispecies PASEP on a finite ring. We use the multiline processes defined by Martin (EJP, 2020), the dynamics of which also depend on the asymmetry parameter $q$, to compute the correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the graph $[G]$ obtained by adding, for each pair of vertices of $G$, a unique vertex adjacent to both vertices is called the binding graph of $G$. In this work, we show that the class of binding graphs is graph-isomorphism complete and that the stable partitions of binding graphs by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm produce automorphism partitions. To test the isomorphism of two graphs $G$ and $H$, one computes the stable graph of the binding graph $[G\uplus H]$ for the disjoint union graph $G\uplus H$. The automorphism partition reveals the isomorphism of $G$ and $H$. Because the WL algorithm is a polynomial-time procedure, the claim can be made that the graph-isomorphism problem is in complexity class $\mathtt{P}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider an {\em enforce operator} on impartial rulesets similar to the Muller Twist and the comply/constrain operator of Smith and St\u anic\u a, 2002. Applied to the rulesets A and B, on each turn the opponent enforces one of the rulesets and the current player complies, by playing a move in that ruleset. If the outcome table of the enforce variation of A and B is the same as the outcome table of A, then we say that A dominates B. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for this relation. Additionally, we define a {\em selective operator} and explore a distributive-lattice-like structure within applicable rulesets. Lastly, we define nim-values under enforce-rulesets, and establish that the Sprague-Grundy theory continues to hold, along with illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Joint distributions of statistics over permutations avoiding two patterns of length 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding distributions of permutation statistics over pattern-avoiding classes of permutations attracted much attention in the literature. In particular, Bukata et al. found distributions of ascents and descents on permutations avoiding any two patterns of length 3. In this paper, we generalize these results in two different ways: we find explicit formulas for the joint distribution of six statistics (asc, des, lrmax, lrmin, rlmax, rlmin), and also explicit formulas for the joint distribution of four statistics (asc, des, MNA, MND) on these permutations in all cases. The latter result also extends the recent studies by Kitaev and Zhang of the statistics MNA and MND (related to non-overlapping occurrences of ascents and descents) on stack-sortable permutations. All multivariate generating functions in our paper are rational, and we provide combinatorial proofs of five equidistribution results that can be derived from the generating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work shows that a new family of norms on Hermitian matrices arise by evaluating the even degree complete homogeneous symmetric (CHS) polynomials on the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix. The CHS norm of a graph is then defined by evaluating the even degree CHS polynomials on the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a graph. The fact that these norms are defined in terms of eigenvalues (as opposed to singular values) ensures they can distinguish between graphs that other norms cannot. In addition, we prove that the CHS norms are minimized over all connected graphs by the path and maximized over all connected graphs by the complete graph. Finally, we prove that the CHS norms are minimized over all trees by the path and maximized over all trees by the star. Our paper is intended for a wide mathematical audience and we assume no prior knowledge about graphs or symmetric polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14055v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interval parking functions are a generalization of parking functions in which cars have an interval preference for their parking. We generalize this definition to parking functions with $n$ cars and $m\geq n$ parking spots, which we call interval rational parking functions and provide a formula for their enumeration. By specifying an integer parameter $\ell\geq 0$, we then consider the subset of interval rational parking functions in which each car parks at most $\ell$ spots away from their initial preference. We call these $\ell$-interval rational parking functions and provide recursive formulas to enumerate this set for all positive integers $m\geq n$ and $\ell$. We also establish formulas for the number of nondecreasing $\ell$-interval rational parking functions via the outcome map on rational parking functions. We also consider the intersection between $\ell$-interval parking functions and Fubini rankings and show the enumeration of these sets is given by generalized Fibonacci numbers. We conclude by specializing $\ell=1$, and establish that the set of $1$-interval rational parking functions with $n$ cars and $m$ spots are in bijection with the set of barred preferential arrangements of $[n]$ with $m-n$ bars. This readily implies enumerative formulas. Further, in the case where $\ell=1$, we recover the results of Hadaway and Harris that unit interval parking functions are in bijection with the set of Fubini rankings, which are enumerated by the Fubini numbers.</description>

      <title>Vacillating parking functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any integers $1\leq k\leq n$, we introduce a new family of parking functions called $k$-vacillating parking functions of length $n$. The parking rule for $k$-vacillating parking functions allows a car with preference $p$ to park in the first available spot in encounters among the parking spots numbered $p$, $p-k$, and $p+k$ (in that order and if those spots exists). In this way, $k$-vacillating parking functions are a modification of Naples parking functions, which allow for backwards movement of a car, and of $\ell$-interval parking functions, which allow a car to park in its preference or up to $\ell$ spots in front of its preference. Among our results, we establish a combinatorial interpretation for the numerator of the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction of $\sqrt{2}$, as the number of non-decreasing $1$-vacillating parking functions of length~$n$. Our main result gives a product formula for the enumeration of $k$-vacillating parking functions of length $n$ based on the number of $1$-vacillating parking functions of smaller length. We conclude with some directions for further research.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the Rank Genetic Algorithm was adapted to address a problem in the field of Chromatic Graph Theory, namely, on the parameter called the connected-pseudoachromatic index. We successfully improved several previously known bounds of that index of the complete graph.</description>

      <title>Solution of some tiling open problems of Propp, Lai, and some related results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai, to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, and to exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>

      <title>Ollivier-Ricci curvature of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the Ollivier-Ricci curvature in terms of graph parameters and an optimal assignment. Utilizing these precise expressions, we examine the relationship between the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the 0-Ollivier-Ricci curvature, resulting in an equality condition on regular graphs. This condition allows us to characterize edges that are bone idle in regular graphs of girth four and to construct a family of bone idle graphs with this girth. We then use our formulas to provide an efficient implementation of the Ollivier-Ricci curvature on regular graphs, enabling us to identify all bone idle, regular graphs with fewer than 15 vertices. Moreover, we establish a rigidity theorem for cocktail party graphs, proving that a regular graph is a cocktail party graph if and only if its Lin-Lu-Yau curvature is equal to one. We conclude this work by presenting a condition on the degree of a regular graph that guarantees positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the enumeration problem of a special kind of branched coverings of the Riemann sphere, whose partition function can be regarded as a generalization of the dessin partition function. First we derive a cut-and-join type representation for the generalized dessin partition function using the actions of $W$-type operators on Schur functions. Then we study the polynomial structures of the generalized dessin partition function. We prove a polynomial structure for the disconnected correlators which generalizes a result of Stanley, and then propose a conjectural polynomial structure for the connected correlators. We prove the $1$-point case of this conjecture using the KP integrability of this partition function.</description>

In particular, we discuss the relationship between the Radon number, the colorful and fractional Helly properties, weak $\varepsilon$-nets, and $(p,q)$-theorems.

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stefan Mandel is the man who won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. Calculations indicate that he took residual risks that his method might fail. Residual risks explain why he changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5)- and (49, 6, 6, 5)-lottery schemes shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades, triggered by growing computing power, and eventually triggered by Stefan Mandel's publicity and successes in the field. But, as the comparison with actual covering designs reveals, Stefan Mandel most likely pioneered in constructing a (15, 6, 5)-covering design many years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the work of Fr\"oberg (1990) and Eagon and Reiner (1998), Bayer et al. recently introduced two new graph complexes: \emph{total cut complexes} and \emph{cut complexes}. In this article, we investigate these complexes specifically for (rectangular) grid graphs, focusing on $2 \times n$ and $3 \times n$ cases. We extend and refine the work of Bayer et al., proving and strengthening several of their conjectures, thereby enhancing the understanding of these graph complexes' topological and combinatorial properties.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizing Parallel Chip-Firing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2010, Kominers and Kominers proved that any parallel chip-firing game on $G(V,\,E)$ with $|\sigma|\geq 4|E|-|V|$ chips stabilizes. Recently, Bu, Choi, and Xu made the bound exact: all games with $|\sigma|&lt; |E|$ chips or $|\sigma|&gt; 3|E|-|V|$ chips stabilize. Meanwhile, Levine found a "devil's staircase'' pattern in the plot of the activity of parallel chip-firing games against their density of chips. The stabilizing bound of Bu, Choi, and Xu corresponds to the top and bottom stairs of this staircase, in which the activity is 1 and 0, respectively. In this paper, we analyze the middle stair of the staircase, corresponding to activity $\frac{1}{2}$. We prove that all parallel chip-firing games with $2|E|-|V|&lt; |\sigma|&lt; 2|E|$ have period $T\neq 3,\,4$. In fact, this is exactly the range of $|\sigma|$ for which all games are non-stabilizing. We conjecture that all parallel chip-firing games with $2|E|-|V|&lt; |\sigma|&lt;2|E|$ have $T=2$ and thus activity $\frac{1}{2}$. This conjecture has been proven for trees by Bu, Choi, and Xu, cycles by Dall'asta, and complete graphs by Levine. We extend Levine's method of conjugate configurations to prove the conjecture on complete bipartite graphs $K_{a,a}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.04114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A polyhedral product is a natural subspace of a Cartesian product that is specified by a simplicial complex. The modern formalism arose as a generalization of the spaces known as moment-angle complexes which were developed within the nascent subject of toric topology. This field, which began as a topological approach to toric geometry and aspects of symplectic geometry, has expanded rapidly in recent years. The investigation of polyhedral products and their homotopy theoretic properties has developed to the point where they are studied in various fields of mathematics far removed from their origin. In this survey, we provide a brief historical overview of the development of this subject, summarize many of the main results and describe applications.</description>

      <title>The localization spectral sequence in the motivic setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.04217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study a motivic lift of a spectral sequence associated to a stratified scheme, recently discovered by Petersen in the context of mixed Hodge theory and $\ell$-adic Galois representations. The original spectral sequence expresses the compactly supported cohomology of an open stratum in terms of the compactly supported cohomology of the closures of strata and the combinatorics of the poset underlying the stratification. Some of its special cases are classical tools in the study of arrangements of subvarieties and configuration spaces. Our motivic lift lives in the triangulated category of \'{e}tale motives and takes the shape of a Postnikov system. We describe its connecting morphisms and study some of its functoriality properties.</description>

      <title>Topological Structures of Large Scale Interacting Systems via Uniform Functions and Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.04699v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the topological structure of large scale interacting systems on infinite graphs, by constructing a suitable cohomology which we call the uniform cohomology. The central idea for the construction is the introduction of a class of functions called uniform functions. Uniform cohomology provides a new perspective for the identification of macroscopic observables from the microscopic system. As a straightforward application of our theory when the underlying graph has a free action of a group, we prove a certain decomposition theorem for shift-invariant closed uniform forms. This result is a uniform version in a very general setting of the decomposition result for shift-invariant closed $L^2$-forms originally proposed by Varadhan, which has repeatedly played a key role in the proof of the hydrodynamic limits of nongradient large scale interacting systems. In a subsequent article, we use this result as a key to prove Varadhan's decomposition theorem for a general class of large scale interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich's star-product up to order 7 for affine Poisson brackets: where are the Riemann zeta values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kontsevich star-product admits a well-defined restriction to the class of affine -- in particular, linear -- Poisson brackets; its graph expansion consists only of Kontsevich's graphs with in-degree $\leqslant 1$ for aerial vertices. We obtain the formula $\star_{\text{aff}}\text{ mod }\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ with harmonic propagators for the graph weights (over $n\leqslant 7$ aerial vertices); we verify that all these weights satisfy the cyclic weight relations by Shoikhet--Felder--Willwacher, that they match the computations using the $\textsf{kontsevint}$ software by Panzer, and the resulting affine star-product is associative modulo $\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$.
  We discover that the Riemann zeta value $\zeta(3)^2/\pi^6$, which enters the harmonic graph weights (up to rationals), actually disappears from the analytic formula of $\star_{\text{aff}}\text{ mod }\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ \textit{because} all the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear combinations of Kontsevich graphs near $\zeta(3)^2/\pi^6$ represent differential consequences of the Jacobi identity for the affine Poisson bracket, hence their contribution vanishes. We thus derive a ready-to-use shorter formula $\star_{\text{aff}}^{\text{red}}$ mod~$\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ with only rational coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Let $P_1, \ldots, P_m \in K[y]$ be polynomials with distinct degrees, no constant terms and coefficients in a general locally compact topological field $K$. We give a quantitative count of the number of polynomial progressions $x, x+P_1(y), \ldots, x + P_m(y)$ lying in a set $S\subseteq K$ of positive density. The proof relies on a general $L^{\infty}$ inverse theorem which is of independent interest. This inverse theorem implies a Sobolev improving estimate for multilinear polynomial averaging operators which in turn implies our quantitative estimate for polynomial progressions. This general Sobolev inequality has the potential to be applied in a number of problems in real, complex and $p$-adic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces measures how far the spaces are from being isometric. It has played an important and longstanding role in geometry and shape comparison. More recently, it has been discovered that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between unit spheres equipped with the geodesic metric has important connections to Borsuk-Ulam theorems and Vietoris-Rips complexes.
  We develop a discrete framework for obtaining upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres, and provide the first quantitative bounds that apply to spheres of all possible pairs of dimensions. As a special case, we determine the exact Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the circle and any higher-dimensional sphere, and determine the precise asymptotic behavior of the distance from the 2-sphere to the $k$-sphere up to constants.</description>

      <title>Joint extremes of inversions and descents of random permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide asymptotic theory for the joint distribution of $X_{\mathrm{inv}}$ and $X_{\mathrm{des}}$, the numbers of inversions and descents of random permutations. Recently, D\"orr &amp; Kahle (2022) proved that $X_{\mathrm{inv}}$, respectively, $X_{\mathrm{des}}$ is in the maximum domain of attraction of the Gumbel distribution. To tackle the dependency between these two permutation statistics, we use H\'ajek projections and a suitable quantitative Gaussian approximation. We show that $(X_{\mathrm{inv}}, X_{\mathrm{des}})$ is in the maximum domain of attraction of the two-dimensional Gumbel distribution with independent margins. This result can be stated in the broader combinatorial framework of finite Coxeter groups, on which our method also yields the central limit theorem for $(X_{\mathrm{inv}}, X_{\mathrm{des}})$ and various other permutation statistics as a novel contribution. In particular, signed permutation groups with random biased signs and products of classical Weyl groups are investigated.</description>

Abstract: Recently, using modular forms F. Beukers posed a unified method that can deal with a large number of supercongruences involving binomial coefficients and Ap\'ery-like numbers. In this paper, we use Beukers' method to prove some conjectures of the first author concerning the congruences for $$\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{\binom{2k}k^3}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k^2\binom{4k}{2k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k\binom{3k}k\binom{6k}{3k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{V_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{T_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{D_n}{m^n} $$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}(-1)^nA_n$ modulo $p^3$, where $p$ is an odd prime representable by some suitable binary quadratic form, $m$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, $V_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{2k}k^2\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}^2$, $T_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}n^2$, $D_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}k\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ and $A_n$ is the Ap\'ery number given by $A_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{n+k}k^2$.</description>
