      <title>Planetary population synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planetary population synthesis method aims at comprehensively testing planet formation theories against observational evidence and providing theoretical sets of planets to help interpret observations and inform instrument development. Recent developments on the theoretical and observational sides are reviewed: First, observational constraints are summarized, then, the work flow of population synthesis and its two main components are presented, which are, global end-to-end models of planetary formation and evolution and probability distributions for the disk initial conditions. Next, the output of four recent population synthesis models is compared in detail and differences and similarities are discussed. The goal is to help the reader understand the assumptions that were made and how they impact the results. Furthermore, future directions of research are identified and the impact of current and future observational programs is discussed. With JWST, evidence on disk and planet compositions emerges. Planet formation models need to prepare for these near-future developments by including self-consistent magnetic wind-driven gas and dust disk evolution, planetary migration, as well as employ hybrid pebble and planetesimal accretion, which are identified as dominant modes of accretion in different mass regimes.</description>

      <title>New Moons of Uranus and Neptune from Ultra-Deep Pencil Beam Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted extremely ultra-deep pencil beam observations for new satellites around both Uranus and Neptune. Tens of images on several different nights in 2021, 2022 and 2023 were obtained and shifted and added together to reach as faint as 26.9 and 27.2 magnitudes in the r-band around Uranus and Neptune, respectively. One new moon of Uranus, S/2023 U1, and two new moons of Neptune, S/2021 N1 and S/2002 N5, were found. S/2023 U1 was 26.6 mags, is about 7 km in diameter and has a distant, eccentric and inclined retrograde orbit similar to Caliban and Stephano, implying these satellites are fragments from a once larger parent satellite. S/2023 U1 almost completely overlaps Stephano in orbital phase space. S/2021 N1 was 26.9 mags, about 14 km in size and has a retrograde orbit similar to Neso and Psamathe, indicating they are a dynamical family. We find S/2021 N1 is in a Kozai-Lidov orbital resonance. S/2002 N5 was 25.9 mags, is about 23 km in size and it makes a family of distant prograde satellites with Sao and Laomedeia. All three new moons show for the first time dynamical groups of moons exist around both Uranus and Neptune. The creation of these groups likely produced dust that could be the source of red material seen on the leading hemispheres of some larger inner satellites like Titania, Oberon and Umbriel. We also detected all known outer moons of Uranus and Neptune on multiple nights. This survey mostly completes the outer satellites of Uranus to about 8 km and Neptune to about 14 km in diameter. The size distributions of satellite dynamical families around the giant planets shows a strong steepening in the power law size distribution smaller than 5 km in diameter. The satellites of a family become much more common smaller than 5 km and their size distribution is consistent with a collisional break-up of a once larger parent satellite.</description>

      <title>JWST captures a sudden stellar outburst and inner disk wall destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00136v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of T~Cha, a highly variable ($\Delta V \sim$3-5\,mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large ($\sim 15$\,au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-infrared spectrum is signiticantly different from the {\it Spitzer} spectrum obtained 17 years before, where the emission at short wavelengths ($5-10 \mu m$) has decreased by $\sim 2/3$ while at longer wavelengths ($15-25 \mu m$) it increased by up to a factor of $\sim 3$. This 'seesaw' behavior is contemporary with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. By analyzing and modelling both SEDs, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that destructed the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower $15-25$\,micron\ emission during the {\it Spitzer} time. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable ($\sim 1/5$) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T~Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.</description>

      <title>The Compositions of Rocky Planets in Close-in Orbits Tend to be Earth-Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hundreds of exoplanets between 1-1.8 times the size of the Earth have been discovered on close in orbits. However, these planets show such a diversity in densities that some appear to be made entirely of iron, while others appear to host gaseous envelopes. To test this diversity in composition, we update the masses of 5 rocky exoplanets (HD 93963 A b, Kepler-10 b, Kepler-100 b, Kepler-407 b, and TOI-1444 b) and present the confirmation of a new planet (TOI-1011) using 187 high precision RVs from Gemini/MAROON-X and Keck/KPF. Our updated planet masses suggest compositions closer to that of the Earth than previous literature values for all planets in our sample. In particular, we report that two previously identified ``super-Mercuries'' (Kepler-100 b and HD 93963 A b) have lower masses that suggest less iron-rich compositions. We then compare the ratio of iron to rock-building species to the abundance ratios of those elements in their host stars. These updated planet compositions do not suggest a steep relationship between planet and host star compositions, contradictory to previous results, and suggest that planets and host stars have similar abundance ratios.</description>

      <title>Resonant amplitude distribution of the Hilda asteroids and the free-floating planet flyby scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some recent work, we provided a quantitative explanation for the number asymmetry of Jupiter Trojans by hypothesizing a free-floating planet (FFP) flyby into the Solar System. In support of that explanation, this paper examines the influence of the same FFP flyby on the Hilda asteroids, which orbit stably in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The observed Hilda population exhibits two distinct resonant patterns: (1) a lack of Hildas with resonant amplitudes &lt; 40 deg. at eccentricities &lt; 0.1; (2) a nearly complete absence of Hildas with amplitudes &lt; 20 deg., regardless of eccentricity. Previous models of Jupiter migration and resonance capture could account for the eccentricity distribution of Hildas but have failed to replicate the unusual absence of those with the smallest resonant amplitudes, which theoretically should be the most stable. Here we report that the FFP flyby can trigger an extremely rapid outward migration of Jupiter, causing a sudden shift in the 3:2 Jovian resonance. Consequently, Hildas with varying eccentricities would have their resonant amplitudes changed by different degrees, leading to the observed resonant patterns. We additionally show that, in our FFP flyby scenario, these patterns are consistently present across different resonant amplitude distributions of primordial Hildas arising from various formation models. We also place constraints on the potential parameters of the FFP, suggesting it should have an eccentricity of 1-1.3 or larger, an inclination up to 30 deg. or higher, and a minimum mass of about 50 Earth masses.</description>

      <title>Planet-disk interaction and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the groundbreaking discovery of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a sun-like star, 51 Pegasi b in 1995, the field of planet formation has become a cornerstone of modern astrophysics. This is in part due to the revelation of an astonishing diversity of planetary types and architectures, inferred from detailed astronomical observations. This diversity is driven by the interplay between the physical processes governing planet assembly and the environmental conditions within the protoplanetary disk in which they form. This chapter provides an introduction to the specific mechanisms that can induce orbital variations in nascent planetary bodies during their formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of trans-Neptunian object (143707) 2003 UY117 derived from stellar occultation and photometric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are considered to be among the most primitive objects in our Solar System. Knowledge of their primary physical properties is essential for understanding their origin and the evolution of the outer Solar System.
  We predicted a stellar occultation by this TNO for 2020 October 23 UT and ran a specific campaign to investigate this event. We derived the projected profile shape and size from the occultation observations by means of an elliptical fit to the occultation chords. We also performed photometric observations of (143707) 2003 UY117 to obtain the absolute magnitude and the rotational period from the observed rotational light curve. Finally, we combined these results to derive the three-dimensional shape, volume-equivalent diameter, and geometric albedo for this TNO.
  From the stellar occultation, we obtained a projected ellipse with axes of $(282 \pm 18) \times (184 \pm 32)$ km. The area-equivalent diameter for this ellipse is $D_\textrm{eq,A} = 228 \pm 21$ km. From our photometric $R$ band observations, we derived an absolute magnitude of $H_V = 5.97 \pm 0.07$ mag using $V-R = 0.46 \pm 0.07$ mag, which was derived from a $V$ band subset of these data. The rotational light curve has a peak-to-valley amplitude of $\Delta m = 0.36 \pm 0.13$ mag. We find the most likely rotation period to be $P = 12.376 \pm 0.0033$ hours. By combining the occultation with the rotational light curve results and assuming a triaxial ellipsoid, we derived axes of $a \times b \times c = (332 \pm 24)$ km $\times$ $(216 \pm 24)$ km $\times$ $(180\substack{+28\\-24})$ km for this ellipsoid, and therefore a volume-equivalent diameter of $D_\textrm{eq,V} = 235 \pm 25$ km. Finally, the values for the absolute magnitude and for the area-equivalent diameter yield a geometric albedo of $p_V = 0.139 \pm 0.027$.</description>

      <title>A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barnard's star is a primary target within the ESPRESSO guaranteed time observations (GTO) as it is the second closest neighbour to our Sun after the $\alpha$ Centauri stellar system. We present here a large set of 156 ESPRESSO observations of Barnard's star carried out over four years with the goal of exploring periods of shorter than 50 days, thus including the habitable zone (HZ). Our analysis of ESPRESSO data using Gaussian process (GP) to model stellar activity suggests a long-term activity cycle at 3200d and confirms stellar activity due to rotation at 140d as the dominant source of radial velocity (RV) variations. These results are in agreement with findings based on publicly available HARPS, HARPS-N, and CARMENES data. ESPRESSO RVs do not support the existence of the previously reported candidate planet at 233d. After subtracting the GP model, ESPRESSO RVs reveal several short-period candidate planet signals at periods of 3.15d, 4.12d, 2.34d, and 6.74d. We confirm the 3.15d signal as a sub-Earth mass planet, with a semi-amplitude of $55 \pm 7$cm/s, leading to a planet minimum mass $m_p \sin i$ of $0.37 \pm 0.05$Mearth, which is about three times the mass of Mars. ESPRESSO RVs suggest the possible existence of a candidate system with four sub-Earth mass planets in circular orbits with semi-amplitudes from 20 to 47cm/s, thus corresponding to minimum masses in the range of 0.17-0.32Mearth. The sub-Earth mass planet at $3.1533 \pm 0.0006$d is in a close-to circular orbit with a semi-major axis of $0.0229 \pm 0.0003$AU, thus located inwards from the HZ of Barnard's star, with an equilibrium temperature of 400K. Additional ESPRESSO observations would be required to confirm that the other three candidate signals originate from a compact short-period planet system orbiting Barnard's star inwards from its HZ.</description>

      <title>A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star: No evidence of transits in TESS photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star, designated as Barnard b, has been recently announced. At a similar time, the first photometric data of Barnard's star by the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was released in Sector 80. We explore the possibility of emergent transits of Barnard b in TESS photometry. The detrended 2 min light curve appears to be flat, with a flux root-mean-square of 0.411 parts per thousand. Attempts of blind and informed transit-curve model inference suggest no evidence of transiting Barnard b, or any other body. This provides a 3$\sigma$ upper bound of 87.9 degrees for the orbital inclination of Barnard b.</description>

      <title>The Dynamical History of HIP-41378 f -- Oblique Exorings Masquerading as a Puffy Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super-puff HIP-41378 f represents a fascinating puzzle due to its anomalously low density on a far-out orbit in contrast with other known super-puffs. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that HIP-41378 f is not in fact a low-density planet, but rather hosts an opaque ring system. We analyze the dynamical history of the system, and show that convergent migration is necessary to explain the system's long-term stability. We then show that this same migration process plausibly captures HIP-41378 f into spin-orbit resonance and excites the planetary obliquity to high values. This tilts the surrounding ring and is a plausible explanation for the large transit depth. In the end, we also briefly comment on the likelihood of other super-puff planets being in high-obliquity states. We show that the existence of a tilted extensive ring around a high obliquity planet can serve as an explanation for puffy planets, particularly in multi-planetary systems at far distances from their host stars.</description>

      <title>Tidal evolution of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of low-mass stars undergo strong tidal effects that modify their spin states. These planets are expected to host dense atmospheres that can also play an important role in the spin evolution. On one hand, gravitational tides tend to synchronise the rotation with the orbital mean motion, but on the other hand, thermal atmospheric tides push the rotation away and may lead to asynchronous equilibria. Here, we investigate the complete tidal evolution of Earth-like planets by taking into account the effect of obliquity and eccentric orbits. We adopted an Andrade rheology for the gravitational tides and benchmarked the unknown parameters with the present rotation of Venus. We then applied our model to Earth-like planets, and we show that asynchronous rotation can be expected for planets orbiting stars with masses between 0.4 and 0.9 $M_\odot$ and semi-major axes between 0.2 and 0.7 au. Interestingly, we find that Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of stars with masses $\sim 0.8$ $M_\odot$ may end up with an equilibrium rotation of 24 hours. We additionally find that these planets can also develop high obliquities, which may help sustain temperate environments.</description>

      <title>The obliquity and atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-122b (KELT-14b) with ESPRESSO: An aligned orbit and no sign of atomic or molecular absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to their short orbital periods and hot extended atmospheres, hot Jupiters are ideal candidates for atmosphere studies with high-resolution spectroscopy. New stable spectrographs help improve our understanding of the evolution and composition of those types of planets. By analyzing two nights of observations using the ESPRESSO high-resolution spectrograph, we studied the architecture and atmosphere of hot Jupiter WASP-122b (KELT-14b). By analyzing the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, we measured the spin-orbit angle of the system to be lambda = 0.09 +0.88/-0.90 deg. This result is in line with literature obliquity measurements of planetary systems around stars with effective temperatures cooler than 6500 K. Using the transmission spectroscopy, we studied the atmosphere of the planet. Applying both the single-line analysis and the cross-correlation method, we looked for Ca I, Cr I, FeH, Fe I, Fe II, H2O, Li I, Mg I, Na I, Ti I, TiO, V I, VO, and Y I. Our results show no evidence of any of these species in WASP-122b's atmosphere. The lack of significant detections can be explained by either the RM effect covering the regions where the atmospheric signal is expected and masking it, along with the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the observations or the absence of the relevant species in its atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Exploring the catastrophic regime: thermodynamics and disintegration in head-on planetary collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Head-on giant impacts (collisions between planet-size bodies) are frequently used to study the planet formation process as they present an extreme configuration where the two colliding bodies are greatly disturbed. With limited computing resources, focusing on these extreme impacts eases the burden of exploring a large parameter space. Results from head-on impacts are often then extended to study oblique impacts with angle corrections or used as initial conditions for other calculations, for example, the evolution of ejected debris. In this study, we conduct a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic and energy budget evolution of high-energy head-on giant impacts, entering the catastrophic impacts regime, for target masses between 0.001 and 12 M$_{\oplus}$. We demonstrate the complex interplay of gravitational forces, shock dynamics, and thermodynamic processing in head-on impacts at high energy. Our study illustrates that frequent interactions of core material with the liquid side of the vapour curve could have cumulative effects on the post-collision remnants, leading to fragmentary disintegration occurring at lower impact energy. This results in the mass of the largest remnant diverging significantly from previously developed scaling laws. These findings suggest two key considerations: 1) head-on planetary collisions for different target masses do not behave similarly, so caution is needed when applying scaling laws across a broad parameter space; 2) an accurate model of the liquid-vapour phase boundary is essential for modeling giant impacts. Our findings highlight the need for careful consideration of impact configurations in planetary formation studies, as head-on impacts involve a complex interplay between thermodynamic processing, shocks, gravitational forces, and other factors.</description>

      <title>Rate-induced biosphere collapse in the Daisyworld model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is much interest in the phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, where a system changes abruptly when forcings change faster than some critical rate. Here, we demonstrate and analyse rate-induced tipping in the classic "Daisyworld" model. The Daisyworld model considers a hypothetical planet inhabited only by two species of daisies with different reflectivities, and is notable because the daisies lead to an emergent "regulation" of the planet's temperature. The model serves as a useful thought experiment regarding the co-evolution of life and the global environment, and has been widely used in the teaching of Earth system science.
  We show that sufficiently fast changes in insolation (i.e. incoming sunlight) can cause life on Daisyworld to go extinct, even if life could in principle survive at any fixed insolation value among those encountered. Mathematically, this occurs due to the fact that the solution of the forced (nonautonomous) system crosses the stable manifold of a saddle point for the frozen (autonomous) system. The new discovery of rate-induced tipping in such a classic, simple, and well-studied model provides further supporting evidence that rate-induced tipping -- and indeed, rate-induced collapse -- may be common in a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PV-Wind-Battery Power System for a Mars Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a hybrid photovoltaic-wind-battery power system designed to sustain a Mars base under varying seasonal and climatic conditions. The Mars Climate Database was utilized to simulate the effects of seasonal changes, diurnal cycles, and dust storms on the system's power generation. The seasonal performance was analyzed across the Martian surface and at potential habitation sites proposed in the "First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars (FLSW).'' Within the hybrid system, the photovoltaic arrays serve as the primary energy source, with wind turbines providing essential backup during nighttime and dust storms. A single $1\,000\,\mathrm{m}^2$ photovoltaic array, a $33.4\,\mathrm{m}$ diameter wind turbine, and a $312\,\mathrm{kWh}$ battery can support a six-person Mars base at $32.1\%$ of the Martian surface during the equinoxes and solstices, expanding to $51.7\%$ with three sets of arrays and turbines. Additionally, $24$ FLSW sites can be supported throughout the solstices and equinoxes by a single photovoltaic array, turbine, and battery, even during global dust storms. Among the $24$ sites, Hebrus Valles, Huygens Crater, and Noctis Labyrinthus had the highest energy production potential. These findings are expected to guide further research on hybrid renewable power systems for Mars exploration.</description>

      <title>JWST imaging of edge-on protoplanetary disks. III. Drastic morphological transformation across the mid-infrared in Oph163131</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST broadband images of the highly inclined protoplanetary disk SSTc2d J163131.2-242627 (Oph163131) from 2.0 to 21$\mu$m. The images show a remarkable evolution in disk structure with wavelength, quite different from previous JWST observations of other edge-on disks. At 2.0 and 4.4$\mu$m, Oph163131 shows two scattering surfaces separated by a dark lane, typical of highly inclined disks. Starting at 7.7$\mu$m however, 1) the two linear nebulosities flanking the dark lane disappear; 2) the brighter nebula tracing the disk upper surface transitions into a compact central source distinctly larger than the JWST PSF and whose intrinsic size increases with wavelength; and 3) patches of extended emission appear at low latitudes, and at surprisingly large radii nearly twice that of the scattered light seen with $HST$ and NIRCam, and of the gas. We interpret the compact central source as thermal emission from the star and the inner disk that is not seen directly, but which instead is able to progressively propagate to greater distances at longer wavelengths. The lack of sharp-edged structures in the extended patchy emission argues against the presence of shocks and suggests photoexcitation or stochastic heating of material smoothly flowing away from the star along the disk surface. Finally, the dark lane thickness decreases significantly between 0.6$\mu$m and 4.4$\mu$m which indicates that the surface layers of Oph163131 lack grains larger than 1$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Deriving the interaction point between a Coronal Mass Ejection and High Speed Stream: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the interaction between an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) detected in situ at the L1 Lagrange point on 2016 October 12 with a trailing High-Speed Stream (HSS). We aim to estimate the region in the interplanetary (IP) space where the interaction happened/started using a combined observational-modeling approach. We use Minimum Variance Analysis and the Walen test to analyze possible reconnection exhaust at the interface of ICME and HSS. We perform a Graduated Cylindrical Shell reconstruction of the CME to estimate the geometry and source location of the CME. Finally, we use a two-step Drag Based Model (DBM) model to estimate the region in IP space where the interaction took place. The magnetic obstacle (MO) observed in situ shows a fairly symmetric and undisturbed structure and shows the magnetic flux, helicity, and expansion profile/speed of a typical ICME. The MVA together with the Walen test, however, confirms reconnection exhaust at the ICME HSS boundary. Thus, in situ signatures are in favor of a scenario where the interaction is fairly recent. The trailing HSS shows a distinct velocity profile which first reaches a semi-saturated plateau with an average velocity of 500 km/s and then saturates at a maximum speed of 710 km/s . We find that the HSS interaction with the ICME is influenced only by this initial plateau. The results of the two-step DBM suggest that the ICME has started interacting with the HSS close to Earth (approx 0.81 au), which compares well with the deductions from in situ signatures.</description>

      <title>On Energization and Loss of the Ionized Heavy Atom and Molecule in Mars' Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of global magnetic fields is often cited to explain why Mars lacks a dense atmosphere. This line of thought is based on a prevailing theory that magnetic fields can shield the atmosphere from solar wind erosion. However, we present observations here to demonstrate a counterintuitive understanding: unlike the global intrinsic magnetic field, the remnant crustal magnetic fields can enhance atmosphere loss when considering loss induced by plasma wave-particle interactions. An analysis of MAVEN data, combined with observation-based simulations, reveals that the bulk of O+ ions would be in resonance with ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves when the latter were present. This interaction then results in significant particle energization, thus enhancing ion escaping. A more detailed analysis attributes the occurrence of the resonance to the presence of Mars' crustal magnetic fields, which cause the majority of nearby ions to gyrate at a frequency matching the resonant condition ({\omega}-k_{\parallel} v_{\parallel}={\Omega}_i) of the waves. The ULF waves, fundamental drivers of this entire process, are excited and propelled by the upstream solar wind. Consequently, our findings offer a plausible explanation for the mysterious changes in Mars' climate, suggesting that the ancient solar wind imparted substantially more energy.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the vertical structure of Martian water ice clouds on nadir atmospheric retrievals from simultaneous EMM/EXI and TGO/ACS-MIR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieving the optical depth of the Martian clouds ($\tau_\mathrm{cld}$) is a powerful way to monitor their spatial and temporal evolution. However, such retrievals from nadir imagery rely on several assumptions, including the vertical structure of the clouds in the atmosphere. Here we compare the results of cloud optical depth retrievals at 320 nm from the Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI) onboard the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) "Hope" orbiter performed using a basic uniform cloud profile used in previous studies and using derived cloud profiles obtained from near-simultaneous Solar Occultation observations in the 3.1-3.4 $\mu$m spectral range from the Middle-Infrared channel of the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) instrument onboard the ESA Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). We show that the latitudinal dependence of the cloud vertical profiles can have a strong impact on the nadir retrievals; neglecting it can lead to a significant underestimation of $\tau_\mathrm{cld}$ in the polar regions (up to 25 % to 50 %, depending on the vertical distribution of the dust in the atmosphere) and to a lesser extent, to an overestimation of $\tau_\mathrm{cld}$ around the equator. We also discuss the impact of a vertically-dependent particle size profile, as previous studies have shown the presence of very small water ice particles at the top of the clouds. From this analysis, we provide recommendations for the improvement of water ice cloud parameterization in radiative transfer algorithms in nadir atmospheric retrievals.</description>

Abstract: Planet-star obliquity and planet-planet ]mutual inclination encode a planetary system's dynamical history, but both of their values are hard to measure for misaligned systems with close-in companions. HAT-P-11 is a K4 star with two known planets: a close-in, misaligned super-Neptune with a $\approx$5-day orbit, and an outer super-Jupiter with a $\approx$10-year orbit. In this work we present a joint orbit fit of the HAT-P-11 system with astrometry and \S-index corrected RV data. By combining our results with previous constraints on the orientation of the star and the inner planet, we find that all three angular momenta -- those of the star, planet b, and planet c -- are significantly misaligned. We confirm the status of planet c as a super-Jupiter, with $2.68\pm0.41\, \mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$ at a semimajor axis of $4.10\pm0.06\,$AU, and planet b's mass of $\mathrm{M_b\sin{i_b}}=0.074\pm0.004\, \mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$. We present the posterior probability distribution of obliquity between star A and planet c, and mutual inclination between planet b and planet c.</description>

      <title>The Prevalence of Resonance Among Young, Close-in Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple planets undergoing disk migration may be captured into a chain of mean-motion resonances with the innermost planet parked near the disk's inner edge. Subsequent dynamical evolution may disrupt these resonances, leading to the non-resonant configurations typically observed among {\it Kepler} planets that are Gyrs old. In this scenario, resonant configurations are expected to be more common in younger systems. This prediction can now be tested, thanks to recent discoveries of young planets, particularly those in stellar clusters, by NASA's {\it TESS} mission. We divided the known planetary systems into three age groups: young ($&lt;$100-Myr-old), adolescent (0.1-1-Gyr-old), and mature ($&gt;1$-Gyr-old). The fraction of neighboring planet pairs having period ratios within a few percent of a first-order commensurability (e.g.~4:3, 3:2, or 2:1) is 70$\pm$15\% for young pairs, 24$\pm$8\% for adolescent pairs, and 15$\pm$2\% for mature pairs. The fraction of systems with at least one nearly commensurable pair (either first or second-order) is 86$\pm13$\% among young systems, 38$\pm12$\% for adolescent systems, and 23$\pm3$\% for mature systems. First-order commensurabilities prevail across all age groups, with an admixture of second-order commensurabilities. Commensurabilities are more common in systems with high planet multiplicity and low mutual inclinations. Observed period ratios often deviate from perfect commensurability by $\sim$1\% even among young planets, too large to be explained by resonant repulsion with equilibrium eccentricity tides. We also find that super-Earths in the radius gap ($1.5-1.9R_\oplus$) are less likely to be near-resonant (11.9$\pm2.0\%$) compared to Earth-sized planets ($R_p&lt;1R_\oplus$; 25.3$\pm4.4\%$) or mini-Neptunes ($1.9R_\oplus \leq R_p&lt;2.5R_\oplus$; 14.4$\pm1.8\%$).</description>

      <title>Unlocking planetesimal magnetic field histories: a refined, versatile model for thermal evolution and dynamo generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal and magnetic histories of planetesimals provide unique insights into the formation and evolution of Earth's building blocks. These histories can be gleaned from meteorites by using numerical models to translate measured properties into planetesimal behaviour. In this paper, we present a new 1D planetesimal thermal evolution and dynamo generation model. This magnetic field generation model is the first of a differentiated, mantled planetesimal that includes both mantle convection and non-eutectic core solidification. We have improved fundamental aspects of mantle heat transport by including a more detailed viscosity model and stagnant lid convection parametrisations consistent with internal heating. We have also added radiogenic heating from $^{60}Fe$ in the metallic Fe-FeS core. Additionally, we implement a combined thermal and compositional buoyancy flux, as well as the latest magnetic field scaling laws to predict magnetic field strengths during the planetesimal's thermal evolution until core solidification is complete. We illustrate the consequences of our model changes with an example run for a 500 km radius planetesimal. These effects include more rapid erosion of core thermal stratification and longer duration of mantle convection compared to previous studies. The additional buoyancy from core solidification has a marginal effect on dynamo strength, but for some initial core sulfur contents it can prevent cessation of the dynamo when mantle convection ends. Our model can be used to investigate the effects of individual parameters on dynamo generation and constrain properties of specific meteorite parent bodies. Combined, these updates mean this model can predict the most reliable and complete magnetic field history for a planetesimal to date, so is a valuable tool for deciphering planetesimal behaviour from meteorite properties.</description>

Abstract: Attempts to probe the atmospheres of rocky planets around M dwarfs present both promise and peril. While their favorable planet-to-star radius ratios enable searches for even thin secondary atmospheres, their high activity levels and high-energy outputs threaten atmosphere survival. Here, we present the 0.6--2.85$\mu$m transmission spectrum of the 1.1 Earth-radius, ~340K rocky planet TRAPPIST-1c obtained over two JWST NIRISS/SOSS transit observations. Each of the two spectra displays 100--500 ppm signatures of stellar contamination. Despite being separated by 367 days, the retrieved spot and faculae properties are consistent between the two visits, resulting in nearly identical transmission spectra. Jointly retrieving for stellar contamination and a planetary atmosphere rules out with high confidence (&gt;3-$\sigma$) not only clear hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, but even thin, 1-bar high-mean molecular weight atmospheres rich in H$_2$O, NH$_3$, or CO (at the 2-$\sigma$ level). We find that the only atmosphere scenarios which our spectrum cannot rule out are CH$_4$- or CO$_2$-rich atmospheres, which are both unlikely to be retained when considering the photodestruction of CH$_4$ and the susceptibility of even a CO$_2$-rich atmosphere to escape given the cumulative high-energy irradiation experienced by the planet. Our results further stress the importance of robustly accounting for stellar contamination when analyzing JWST observations of exo-Earths around M dwarfs, as well as the need for high-fidelity stellar models to search for the potential signals of thin secondary atmospheres.</description>

Abstract: Using data from Gaia DR3, we construct a sample of 14,791 gravitationally bound wide pairs in which one of the components is an unresolved binary with an astrometric orbital or acceleration solution. These systems are hierarchical triples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations of $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer tertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to calibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary solutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are typically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G&gt;14$, and by a factor of $1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a factor of $\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions for the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are underestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant improvement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide tabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and make the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.</description>
