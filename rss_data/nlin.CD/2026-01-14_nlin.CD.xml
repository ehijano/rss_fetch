      <title>Wave kinetics in an integrable model -- the Kaup-Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wave turbulence in one-dimensional (1-D) bidirectional shallow water waves described by the Kaup-Boussinesq (KB) equation, which is known to be an integrable system. In contrast to the generally accepted empirical belief that an integrable system yields no kinetic theory, we derive and validate a non-trivial wave kinetic equation (WKE) for the KB system with a non-zero interaction coefficient on the four-wave resonant manifold. This WKE is non-homogeneous in nature due to the non-homogeneity in the dispersion relation of the KB system; however, approximate Kolomogrov-Zakharov (KZ) solutions can be derived in a novel way under certain approximations. We numerically verify the theoretical findings in two cases: (i) In free-evolution cases, although the discrete (nonlinear) spectrum remains unchanged as guaranteed by an integrable system's isospectrality, an initial arbitrary wavenumber spectrum quickly evolves into a thermo-equilibrium state, demonstrating the kinetic aspect of the system; (ii) in forced-dissipated cases, we find stationary power-law spectra that agree with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Modeling of Stochastic Chemical Dynamics on Complex Manifolds: A Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN Framework for the Curvature-Perturbed Ginzburg-Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate identification and control of spatiotemporal chaos in reaction-diffusion systems remains a grand challenge in chemical engineering, particularly when the underlying catalytic surface possesses complex, unknown topography. In the \textit{Defect Turbulence} regime, system dynamics are governed by topological phase singularities (spiral waves) whose motion couples to manifold curvature via geometric pinning. Conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using ReLU or Tanh activations suffer from fundamental \textit{spectral bias}, failing to resolve high-frequency gradients and causing amplitude collapse or phase drift. We propose a Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture leveraging periodic sinusoidal activations with frequency-diverse initialization, embedding the appropriate inductive bias for wave-like physics directly into the network structure. This enables simultaneous resolution of macroscopic wave envelopes and microscopic defect cores. Validated on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation evolving on latent Riemannian manifolds, our architecture achieves relative state prediction error $\epsilon_{L_2} \approx 1.92 \times 10^{-2}$, outperforming standard baselines by an order of magnitude while preserving topological invariants ($|\Delta N_{defects}| &lt; 1$). We solve the ill-posed \textit{inverse pinning problem}, reconstructing hidden Gaussian curvature fields solely from partial observations of chaotic wave dynamics (Pearson correlation $\rho = 0.965$). Training dynamics reveal a distinctive Spectral Phase Transition at epoch $\sim 2,100$, where cooperative minimization of physics and geometry losses drives the solver to Pareto-optimal solutions. This work establishes a new paradigm for Geometric Catalyst Design, offering a mesh-free, data-driven tool for identifying surface heterogeneity and engineering passive control strategies in turbulent chemical reactors.</description>

      <title>Collapse of statistical equilibrium in large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At scales larger than the forcing scale, some out-of-equilibrium turbulent systems (such as hydrodynamic turbulence, wave turbulence, and nonlinear optics) exhibit a state of statistical equilibrium where energy is equipartitioned among large-scale modes, in line with the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Key open questions now pertain to either the emergence, decay, collapse, or other nonstationary evolutions from this state. Here, we experimentally investigate the free decay of large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves, initially in a regime of statistical equilibrium. Using space- and time-resolved measurements, we show that the total energy of these large-scale tensional waves decays as a power law in time. We derive an energy decay law from the theoretical initial equilibrium spectrum and the linear viscous damping, as no net energy flux is carried. Our prediction then shows a good agreement with experimental data over nearly two decades in time, for various initial effective temperatures of the statistical equilibrium state. We further identify the dissipation mechanism and confirm it experimentally. Our approach could be applied to other decaying turbulence systems, with the large scales initially in statistical equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Patterns Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrence plots (RPs) are powerful tools for visualizing time series dynamics; however, traditional Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) often relies on global metrics, such as line counting, that can overlook system-specific, localized structures. To address this, we introduce Recurrence Pattern Correlation (RPC), a quantifier inspired by spatial statistics that bridges the gap between qualitative RP inspection and quantitative analysis. RPC is designed to measure the correlation degree of an RP to patterns of arbitrary shape and scale. By choosing patterns with specific time lags, we visualize the unstable manifolds of periodic orbits within the Logistic map bifurcation diagram, dissect the mixed phase space of the Standard map, and track the unstable periodic orbits of the Lorenz '63 system's 3-dimensional phase space. This framework reveals how long-range correlations in recurrence patterns encode the underlying properties of nonlinear dynamics and provides a more flexible tool to analyze pattern formation in recurrent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Classical periodic trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>
