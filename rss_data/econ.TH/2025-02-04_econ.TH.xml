      <title>Frame-dependent Random Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the influence of framing on decision-making, where some products are framed (e.g., displayed, recommended, endorsed, or labeled). We introduce a novel choice function that captures observed variations in framed alternatives. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive revealed preference analysis, employing the concept of frame-dependent utility using both deterministic and probabilistic data. We demonstrate that simple and intuitive behavioral principles characterize our frame-dependent random utility model (FRUM), which offers testable conditions even with limited data. Finally, we introduce a parametric model to increase the tractability of FRUM. We also discuss how to recover the choice types in our framework.</description>

      <title>Bargaining with transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a solution to the problem of bargaining with transfers, along with an axiomatisation of the solution. Inefficient allocations in the bargaining set can influence the solution, but are discounted relative to more efficient ones. The key axioms are additivity and a property we call \emph{inverse monotonicity}, which states that adding an allocation to the bargaining set that is worse for a given player than the initial solution cannot benefit that player.</description>

      <title>Inertial Updating with General Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study belief revision when information is represented by a set of probability distributions, or general information. General information extends the standard event notion while including qualitative information (A is more likely than B), interval information (A has a ten-to-twenty percent chance), and more. We behaviorally characterize Inertial Updating: the decision maker's posterior is of minimal subjective distance from her prior, given the information constraint. Further, we introduce and characterize a notion of Bayesian updating for general information and show that Bayesian agents may disagree. We also behaviorally characterize f-divergences, the class of distances consistent with Bayesian updating.</description>

      <title>Networked Digital Public Goods Games with Heterogeneous Players and Convex Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital age, resources such as open-source software and publicly accessible databases form a crucial category of digital public goods, providing extensive benefits for Internet. This paper investigates networked public goods games involving heterogeneous players and convex costs, focusing on the characterization of Nash Equilibrium (NE). In these games, each player can choose her effort level, representing her contributions to public goods. Network structures are employed to model the interactions among participants. Each player's utility consists of a concave value component, influenced by the collective efforts of all players, and a convex cost component, determined solely by the individual's own effort. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the networked public goods game with convex costs.
  Our research begins by examining welfare solutions aimed at maximizing social welfare and ensuring the convergence of pseudo-gradient ascent dynamics. We establish the presence of NE in this model and provide an in-depth analysis of the conditions under which NE is unique. We also delve into comparative statics, an essential tool in economics, to evaluate how slight modifications in the model--interpreted as monetary redistribution--affect player utilities. In addition, we analyze a particular scenario with a predefined game structure, illustrating the practical relevance of our theoretical insights. Overall, our research enhances the broader understanding of strategic interactions and structural dynamics in networked public goods games, with significant implications for policy design in internet economic and social networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Communication in Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the organization of communication between biased senders and a receiver. Senders can misreport their private information at a cost. Efficiency is achieved by clearing information asymmetries without incurring costs. Results show that only one communication protocol is efficient, robust to collusion, and free from unnecessary complexities. This protocol has a simple, adversarial, and public structure. It always induces efficient equilibria, for which a closed-form characterization is provided. The findings are relevant for the design of organizations that seek to improve decision-making while limiting wasteful influence activities.</description>

      <title>Incentives and Strategic Behaviour: An Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How and why do incentive levels affect strategic behaviour? This paper examines an experiment designed to identify the causal effect of scaling up incentives on choices, beliefs, and response times in dominance-solvable games. Higher incentives increase action sophistication and decrease mistake propensity, while beliefs become more accurate, and response times longer. We provide evidence that higher incentives increase cognitive effort, as proxied by longer response times, which in turn is associated with improved performance and predicts choice sophistication and belief accuracy. Overall, the data lend support to both payoff-dependent mistakes and costly reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Signaling With Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the canonical signaling game, endowing the sender with commitment power: before learning the state, sender designs a strategy, which maps the state into a probability distribution over actions. We provide a geometric characterization of the sender's attainable payoffs, described by the topological join of the graphs of the interim payoff functions associated with different sender actions. We then incorporate payoff irrelevant messages into the game, characterizing the attainable payoffs when sender commits to (i) both messages and actions, and (ii) only messages. By studying the tradeoffs between these model variations, we highlight the power of commitment to actions. We apply our results to the design of adjudication procedures and rating systems.</description>

      <title>Patience ensures fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of fairly allocating a sequence of time slots when agents may have different levels of patience (Mackenzie and Komornik 2023). For each number of agents, we provide a lower threshold and an upper threshold on the level of patience such that (i) if each agent is at least as patient as the lower threshold, then there is a proportional allocation, and (ii) if each agent is at least as patient as the upper threshold and moreover has weak preference for earlier time slots, then there is an envy-free allocation. In both cases, the proof is constructive.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium existence in a discrete-time endogenous growth model with physical and human capital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a discrete-time version of the Lucas-Uzawa endogenous growth model with physical and human capital in the presence of externalities. Existence of an optimal equilibrium is proved using tools from dynamic programming with bounded or unbounded returns. The proofs also rely on properties of isoelastic utility and homogeneous production functions and apply well-known inequalities in real analysis, seldom used in the literature, which significantly simplify the task of verifying certain assumptions that are rather technical in nature. Some advantages of adopting a parametric family of isoelastic utility functions, instead of the ad hoc formulation typically used, are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design mechanisms for maintaining public goods which require periodic in-kind contributions, motivated by incentives problems facing crowd-sourced recommender systems. Utilitarian welfare is maximized by redistributive policies which are infeasible when group members can leave or misreport their preferences. An optimal mechanism reduces contributions for group members with low benefit-cost ratios to encourage participation; and pairs reduced contributions with restricted access to the good to ensure truthful reporting. At most two membership tiers are offered at the optimum, indicating that ecommerce and digital content platforms may benefit substantially from offering simple user-adjustable recommendation settings.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, may soon be able to mimic individual personalities. This would potentially transform search across human candidates, including for marriage and jobs -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun experimenting with training "AI clones" to represent users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones and their imperfect representation of humans. Individuals are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations. I compare two search regimes: an "in-person regime" -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an "AI representation regime" -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a higher expected match quality than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>
