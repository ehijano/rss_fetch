      <title>Proportional Selection in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of selecting $k$ representative nodes from a network, aiming to achieve two objectives: identifying the most influential nodes and ensuring the selection proportionally reflects the network's diversity. We propose two approaches to accomplish this, analyze them theoretically, and demonstrate their effectiveness through a series of experiments.</description>

      <title>Preference graphs: a combinatorial tool for game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preference graph is a combinatorial representation of the structure of a normal-form game. Its nodes are the strategy profiles, with an arc between profiles if they differ in the strategy of a single player, where the orientation indicates the preferred choice for that player. We show that the preference graph is a surprisingly fundamental tool for studying normal-form games, which arises from natural axioms and which underlies many key game-theoretic concepts, including dominated strategies and strict Nash equilibria, as well as classes of games like potential games, supermodular games and weakly acyclic games. The preference graph is especially related to game dynamics, playing a significant role in the behaviour of fictitious play and the replicator dynamic. Overall, we aim to equip game theorists with the tools and understanding to apply the preference graph to new problems in game theory.</description>

      <title>Noncooperative Equilibrium Selection via a Trading-based Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncooperative multi-agent systems often face coordination challenges due to conflicting preferences among agents. In particular, agents acting in their own self-interest can settle on different equilibria, leading to suboptimal outcomes or even safety concerns. We propose an algorithm named trading auction for consensus (TACo), a decentralized approach that enables noncooperative agents to reach consensus without communicating directly or disclosing private valuations. TACo facilitates coordination through a structured trading-based auction, where agents iteratively select choices of interest and provably reach an agreement within an a priori bounded number of steps. A series of numerical experiments validate that the termination guarantees of TACo hold in practice, and show that TACo achieves a median performance that minimizes the total cost across all agents, while allocating resources significantly more fairly than baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Exact Maximin Share Fairness via Adjusted Supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses fair allocation of indivisible items in settings wherein it is feasible to create copies of resources or dispose of tasks. We establish that exact maximin share (MMS) fairness can be achieved via limited duplication of goods even under monotone valuations. We also show that, when allocating chores under monotone costs, MMS fairness is always feasible with limited disposal of chores. Since monotone valuations do not admit any nontrivial approximation guarantees for MMS, our results highlight that such barriers can be circumvented by post facto adjustments in the supply of the items.
  We prove that, for division of $m$ goods among $n$ agents with monotone valuations, there always exists an assignment of subsets of goods to the agents such that they receive at least their maximin shares and no single good is allocated to more than $3 \log m$ agents. Also, the sum of the sizes of the assigned subsets (i.e., the total number of goods assigned, with copies) does not exceed $m$. For additive valuations, we prove that there always exists an MMS assignment in which no good is allocated to more than $2$ agents and the total number of goods assigned, with copies, is at most $2m$. For additive ordered valuations, we obtain a bound of $O(\sqrt{\log m})$ on the maximum assignment multiplicity and an $m + \widetilde{O}\left(\frac{m}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$ bound for the total number of goods assigned.
  For chore division, we upper bound the number of chores that need to be discarded to ensure MMS fairness. We prove that, under monotone costs, there always exists an MMS assignment in which at most $\frac{m}{e}$ remain unassigned. For additive ordered costs, we establish that MMS fairness can be achieved while keeping at most $\widetilde{O} \left(\frac{m}{n^{1/4}} \right)$ chores unassigned. We also prove that the obtained bounds for monotone valuations and costs are essentially tight.</description>

      <title>Clone-Resistant Weights in Metric Spaces: A Framework for Handling Redundancy Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are given a set of elements in a metric space. The distribution of the elements is arbitrary, possibly adversarial. Can we weigh the elements in a way that is resistant to such (adversarial) manipulations? This problem arises in various contexts. For instance, the elements could represent data points, requiring robust domain adaptation. Alternatively, they might represent tasks to be aggregated into a benchmark; or questions about personal political opinions in voting advice applications. This article introduces a theoretical framework for dealing with such problems. We propose clone-proof representation functions as a solution concept. These functions distribute importance across elements of a set such that similar objects (``clones'') share (some of) their weights, thus avoiding a potential bias introduced by their multiplicity. Our framework extends the maximum uncertainty principle to accommodate general metric spaces and includes a set of axioms - symmetry, continuity, and clone-proofness - that guide the construction of representation functions. Finally, we address the existence of representation functions satisfying our axioms in the significant case of Euclidean spaces and propose a general method for their construction.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Participation Bias by Balancing Extreme Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rating aggregation plays a crucial role in various fields, such as product recommendations, hotel rankings, and teaching evaluations. However, traditional averaging methods can be affected by participation bias, where some raters do not participate in the rating process, leading to potential distortions. In this paper, we consider a robust rating aggregation task under the participation bias. We assume that raters may not reveal their ratings with a certain probability depending on their individual ratings, resulting in partially observed samples. Our goal is to minimize the expected squared loss between the aggregated ratings and the average of all underlying ratings (possibly unobserved) in the worst-case scenario.
  We focus on two settings based on whether the sample size (i.e. the number of raters) is known. In the first setting, where the sample size is known, we propose an aggregator, named as the Balanced Extremes Aggregator. It estimates unrevealed ratings with a balanced combination of extreme ratings. When the sample size is unknown, we derive another aggregator, the Polarizing-Averaging Aggregator, which becomes optimal as the sample size grows to infinity. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed aggregators in mitigating participation bias, compared to simple averaging and the spectral method. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our aggregators on a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Counter Categories and Ratings in PvP Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In competitive games, strength ratings like Elo are widely used to quantify player skill and support matchmaking by accounting for skill disparities better than simple win rate statistics. However, scalar ratings cannot handle complex intransitive relationships, such as counter strategies seen in Rock-Paper-Scissors. To address this, recent work introduced Neural Rating Table and Neural Counter Table, which combine scalar ratings with discrete counter categories to model intransitivity. While effective, these methods rely on neural network training and cannot perform real-time updates. In this paper, we propose an online update algorithm that extends Elo principles to incorporate real-time learning of counter categories. Our method dynamically adjusts both ratings and counter relationships after each match, preserving the explainability of scalar ratings while addressing intransitivity. Experiments on zero-sum competitive games demonstrate its practicality, particularly in scenarios without complex team compositions.</description>

      <title>First-order (coarse) correlated equilibria in non-concave games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate first-order notions of correlated equilibria; distributions of actions for smooth, potentially non-concave games such that players do not incur any regret against small modifications to their strategies along a set of continuous vector fields. We define two such notions, based on local deviations and on stationarity of the distribution, and identify the notion of coarseness as the setting where the associated vector fields are in fact gradient fields. For coarse equilibria, we prove that online (projected) gradient decent has a universal approximation property for both variants of equilibrium. In the non-coarse setting, we instead reduce the problem of finding an equilibrium to fixed-point computation via the usual framework of $\Phi$-regret minimisation, and identify tractable instances. Finally, we study the primal-dual framework to our notion of first-order equilibria. For coarse equilibria defined by a family of functions, we find that a dual bound on the worst-case expectation of a performance metric takes the form of a generalised Lyapunov function for the dynamics of the game. Specifically, usual primal-dual price of anarchy analysis for coarse correlated equilibria as well as the smoothness framework of Roughgarden are both equivalent to a problem of general Lyapunov function estimation. For non-coarse equilibria, we instead observe a vector field fit problem for the gradient dynamics of the game. These follow from containment results in normal form games; the usual notion of a (coarse) correlated equilibria is equivalent to our first-order local notions of (coarse) correlated equilibria with respect to an appropriately chosen set of vector fields.</description>

      <title>Constant-Factor Distortion Mechanisms for $k$-Committee Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $k$-committee election problem, we wish to aggregate the preferences of $n$ agents over a set of alternatives and select a committee of $k$ alternatives that minimizes the cost incurred by the agents. While we typically assume that agent preferences are captured by a cardinal utility function, in many contexts we only have access to ordinal information, namely the agents' rankings over the outcomes. As preference rankings are not as expressive as cardinal utilities, a loss of efficiency is inevitable, and is quantified by the notion of \emph{distortion}.
  We study the problem of electing a $k$-committee that minimizes the sum of the $\ell$-largest costs incurred by the agents, when agents and candidates are embedded in a metric space. This problem is called the $\ell$-centrum problem and captures both the utilitarian and egalitarian objectives. When $k \geq 2$, it is not possible to compute a bounded-distortion committee using purely ordinal information. We develop the first algorithms (that we call mechanisms) for the $\ell$-centrum problem (when $k \geq 2$), which achieve $O(1)$-distortion while eliciting only a very limited amount of cardinal information via value queries. We obtain two types of query-complexity guarantees: $O(\log k \log n)$ queries \emph{per agent}, and $O(k^2 \log^2 n)$ queries \emph{in total} (while achieving $O(1)$-distortion in both cases). En route, we give a simple adaptive-sampling algorithm for the $\ell$-centrum $k$-clustering problem.</description>

      <title>Performative Prediction with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performative prediction is a framework for learning models that influence the data they intend to predict. We focus on finding classifiers that are performatively stable, i.e. optimal for the data distribution they induce. Standard convergence results for finding a performatively stable classifier with the method of repeated risk minimization assume that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous to the model's parameters. Under this assumption, the loss must be strongly convex and smooth in these parameters; otherwise, the method will diverge for some problems. In this work, we instead assume that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the model's predictions, a more natural assumption for performative systems. As a result, we are able to significantly relax the assumptions on the loss function. In particular, we do not need to assume convexity with respect to the model's parameters. As an illustration, we introduce a resampling procedure that models realistic distribution shifts and show that it satisfies our assumptions. We support our theory by showing that one can learn performatively stable classifiers with neural networks making predictions about real data that shift according to our proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for large-scale market equilibrium computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical algorithms for market equilibrium computation such as proportional response dynamics face scalability issues with Internet-based applications such as auctions, recommender systems, and fair division, despite having an almost linear runtime in terms of the product of buyers and goods. In this work, we provide the first quantum algorithm for market equilibrium computation with sub-linear performance. Our algorithm provides a polynomial runtime speedup in terms of the product of the number of buyers and goods while reaching the same optimization objective value as the classical algorithm. Numerical simulations of a system with 16384 buyers and goods support our theoretical results that our quantum algorithm provides a significant speedup.</description>
