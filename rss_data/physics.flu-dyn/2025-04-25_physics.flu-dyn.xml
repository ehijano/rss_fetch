      <title>Data-driven stability analysis in a multi-element supercritical Liquid Oxygen-methane combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoacoustic instability (TAI) is a pressing problem in rocket combustors. TAI can cause significant damage to a combustor, resulting in mission failure. Therefore, stability analysis is crucial during the design and development phases of a rocket combustor. Stability analysis during the design phase can be substantially aided by the rocket combustor's large eddy simulation (LES). However, the computational cost of LES for full-scale rocket combustors is high. Therefore, using a small set of data from a large eddy simulation of a multi-element full-scale combustor, we investigated the effectiveness and computational needs of many data-driven and physics-driven tools for the classification of the stable and unstable regimes in the current study. Recurrence network analysis (RNA), reservoir computing (RC), and multi-scale permutation entropy (MPEA) analysis are the instruments employed in this study. The regime categorization task is unsuitable for RNA and MPEA, according to the results. With little input data, RC-based metrics may map the stable and unstable regimes and are thought to be computationally inexpensive and straightforward to use. In order to help with the design and development of rocket combustors, the combined LES-RC method to stability analysis is therefore anticipated to result in a notable decrease in processing needs.</description>

      <title>Electrohydrodynamic drift of a drop away from an insulating wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolated charge-neutral drop suspended in an unbounded medium does not migrate in a uniform DC electric field.
  A nearby wall breaks the symmetry and causes the drop to drift towards or away from the boundary, depending on the electric properties of the fluids and the wall. In the case of an electrically insulating wall and an electric field applied tangentially to the wall, the interaction of the drop with its electrostatic image gives rise to repulsion by the wall. However, the electrohydrodynamic flow causes either repulsion for a drop with $\mathrm{R/P}&lt;1$, where $\mathrm{R}$ and $\mathrm{P}$ are the drop-to-medium ratios of conductivity and permittivity, respectively, or attraction for $\mathrm{R/P}&gt;1$. We experimentally measure droplet trajectories and quantify the wall-induced electrohydrodynamic lift in the case $\mathrm{R/P}&lt;1$. Numerical simulations using the boundary integral method agree well with the experiment and also explore the $\mathrm{R/P}&gt;1$ case. The results show that the lateral migration of a drop in a uniform electric field applied parallel to an insulating wall is dominated by the long-range flow due to the image stresslet.</description>

      <title>Intermittency and non-universality of pair dispersion in isothermal compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical properties of the pair dispersion of Lagrangian particles (tracers) in incompressible turbulent flows provide insights into transport and mixing. We explore the same in transonic to supersonic compressible turbulence of an isothermal ideal gas in two dimensions, driven by large-scale solenoidal and irrotational stirring forces, via direct numerical simulations. We find that the scaling exponents of the order-$p$ negative moments of the distribution of exit times -- in particular, the doubling and halving times of pair separations -- are nonlinear functions of $p$. Furthermore, the doubling and halving time statistics are different. The halving-time exponents are universal -- they satisfy their multifractal model-based prediction, irrespective of the nature of the stirring. However, the doubling-time exponents are not. In the solenoidally-stirred flows, the doubling time exponents can be expressed solely in terms of the multifractal scaling exponents obtained from the structure functions of the solenoidal component of the velocity. Moreover, they depend strongly on the Mach number, $\Ma$, as elongated patches of high vorticity emerge along shock fronts at high $\Ma$. In contrast, in the irrotationally-stirred flows, the doubling-time exponents do not satisfy any known multifractal model-based relation, and are independent of $\Ma$. Our findings are of potential relevance to astrophysical disks and molecular clouds wherein turbulent transport and mixing of gases often govern chemical kinetics and the rates of formation of stars and planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Trapping microswimmers in acoustic streaming flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acoustofluidic method holds great promise for manipulating microorganisms. When exposed to the steady vortex structures of acoustic streaming flow, these microorganisms exhibit intriguing dynamic behaviors, such as hydrodynamic trapping and aggregation. To uncover the mechanisms behind these behaviors, we investigate the swimming dynamics of both passive and active particles within a two-dimensional acoustic streaming flow. By employing a theoretically calculated streaming flow field, we demonstrate the existence of stable bounded orbits for particles. Additionally, we introduce rotational diffusion and examine the distribution of particles under varying flow strengths. Our findings reveal that active particles can laterally migrate across streamlines and become trapped in stable bounded orbits closer to the vortex center, whereas passive particles are confined to movement along the streamlines. We emphasize the influence of the flow field on the distribution and trapping of active particles, identifying a flow configuration that maximizes their aggregation. These insights contribute to the manipulation of microswimmers and the development of innovative biological microfluidic chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work frames the first three publications around the development of the Flight Physics Concept Inventory (FliP-CoIn), and elaborates on many aspects in more detail. FliP-CoIn is a multiple-choice conceptual assessment instrument for improving fluid dynamics learning and teaching. I give insights into why and how FliP-CoIn was developed and how it is best used for improving conceptual learning. Further, this work presents evidence for several dimensions of FliP-CoIn's validity and reliability. Finally, I discuss key insights from the development process, the data analysis, and give recommendations for future research.

      <title>Exact solutions for the moments of the binary collision integral and its relation to the relaxation-time approximation in leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the moments of the nonlinear binary collision integral in the ultrarelativistic hard-sphere approximation for an arbitrary anisotropic distribution function in the local rest frame. This anisotropic distribution function has an angular asymmetry controlled by the parameter of anisotropy $\xi$, such that in the limit of a vanishing anisotropy $\lim_{\xi \rightarrow 0} \hat{f}_{0 \mathbf{k}} = f_{0 \mathbf{k}}$, approaches the spherically symmetric local equilibrium distribution function. The corresponding moments of the binary collision integral are obtained in terms of quadratic products of different moments of the anisotropic distribution function and couple to a well defined set of lower-order moments. To illustrate these results we compare the moments of the binary collision integral to the moments of the widely used relaxation-time approximation of Anderson and Witting in case of a spheroidal distribution function. We found that in an expanding system the nonlinear Boltzmann collision term leads to twice slower equilibration than the relaxation-time approximation. Furthermore we also show that including two dynamical moments helps to resolve the ambiguity which additional moment of the Boltzmann equation to choose to close the conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Optical to infrared mapping of vapor-to-liquid phase change dynamics using generative machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared thermography is a powerful tool for studying liquid-to-vapor phase change processes. However, its application has been limited in the study of vapor-to-liquid phase transitions due to the presence of complex liquid dynamics, multiple phases within the same field of view, and experimental difficulty. Here, we develop a calibration framework which is capable to studying one of the most complex two-phase heat transfer processes: dropwise condensation. The framework accounts for non-uniformities arising from dynamic two-phase interactions such as droplet nucleation, growth, coalescence, and departure, as well as substrate effects particularly observed on micro- and nanoengineered surfaces. This approach enables high-resolution temperature measurements with both spatial (12 $\mu$m) and temporal (5 ms) precision, leading to the discovery of local temperature phenomena unobservable using conventional approaches. These observed temperature variations are linked to droplet statistics, showing how different regions contribute to local condensation heat transfer. We extend the developed method to quantify local thermal parameters by fusing it with a generative machine learning model to map visual images into temperature fields. The model is informed of the physical parameter by incorporating vapor pressure embedding as the conditional parameter. This work represents a significant step toward simplifying local temperature measurements for vapor-to-liquid phase change phenomena by developing a methodology as well as a machine learning approach to map local thermal phenomena using only optical images as the input.</description>

      <title>A new dynamic slip approach for wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulations in a Consistent Discontinuous Galerkin Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wall-modeled large eddy simulation approach is proposed in a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) setting, building on the slip-wall concept of Bae et al. (JFM'19) and the universal scaling relationship by Pradhan and Duraisamy (JFM'23). The effect of the order of the DG approximation is introduced via the length scales in the formulation. The level of under-resolution is represented by a slip Reynolds number and the model attempts to incorporate the effects of the numerical discretization and the subgrid-scale model. The dynamic part of the new model is based on a modified form of Germano identity --performed on the universal scaling parameter-- and is coupled with the dynamic Smagorinsky model. A sharp modal cut-off filter is used as the test filter for the dynamic procedure, and the dynamic model can be easily integrated into any DG solver. Numerical experiments on channel flows show that grid independence of the statistics is achievable and predictions for the mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles agree well with the direct numerical simulation, even with significant under-resolution. When applied to flows with separation and reattachment, the model also consistently predicts one-point statistics in the reverse flow and post-reattachment regions in good agreement with experiments. The performance of the model in accurately predicting equilibrium and separated flows using significantly under-resolved meshes can be attributed to several aspects that work synergistically: the optimal finite-element projection framework; the interplay of the scale-separation and numerical discretization within the DG framework; and the consistent dynamic procedures for subgrid and wall modeling.</description>

      <title>Flow associated with Lighthill's elongated-body theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic forces acting on an undulating swimming fish consist of two components: a drag-based resistive force and a reactive force originating from the necessary acceleration of an added mass of water. Lighthill's elongated-body theory, based on potential flow, provides a framework for calculating this reactive force. By leveraging the high aspect ratio of most fish, the theory simplifies the problem into a series of independent two-dimensional slices of fluids along the fish's body, which exchange momentum with the body and neighbouring slices. Using momentum conservation arguments, Lighthill's theory predicts the total thrust generated by an undulating fish, based solely on the dimensions and kinematics of its caudal fin. However, the assumption of independent slices has led to the common misconception that the flow produced lacks a longitudinal component. In this paper, we revisit Lighthill's theory, offering a modern reinterpretation using essential singularities of potential flows. We then extend it to predict the full three-dimensional flow field induced by the fish's body motion. Our results compare favourably with numerical simulations of realistic fish geometries.</description>

      <title>Separation control applied to the turbulent flow around a NACA4412 wing section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carried out high-resolution large-eddy simulations (LESs) to investigate the effects of several separation-control approaches on a NACA4412 wing section with spanwise width of $L_z = 0.6$ at an angle of attack of $AoA=11^{\circ}$ at a Reynolds number of $Re_c = 200,000$ based on chord length $c$ and free-stream velocity $U_{\infty}$. Two control strategies were considered: (1) steady uniform blowing and/or suction on the suction and/or pressure sides, and (2) periodic control on the suction side. A wide range of control configurations were evaluated in terms of aerodynamic efficiency (i.e., lift-to-drag ratio) and separation delay. Uniform blowing and/or suction effectively delayed flow separation, leading to a lift increase of up to $11\%$, but yielded only marginal improvements in aerodynamic efficiency. In contrast, periodic control neither enhanced separation delay nor improved efficiency. A detailed analysis of the interaction between uniform blowing and/or suction and turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) over the wing was performed, including assessments of (1) integral boundary-layer quantities, (2) turbulence statistics, and (3) power-spectral densities. Significant modifications in Reynolds stresses and spectral characteristics were observed. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first numerical study utilizing high-resolution LESs to provide comprehensive assessments on separation control.</description>

      <title>On the development of OpenFOAM solvers for simulating MHD micropolar fluid flows with or without the effect of micromagnetorotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper introduces two new OpenFOAM solvers, epotMicropolarFoam and epotMMRFoam, developed for simulating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) micropolar flows with magnetic particles, such as blood, without or with the effect of micromagnetorotation (MMR). MMR refers to the magnetic torque resulting from the misalignment between the magnetization of magnetic particles within the fluid and the magnetic field, influencing the internal rotation (microrotation) of these particles. Blood can be represented as a micropolar fluid containing magnetic particles, owing to the magnetization of erythrocytes. EpotMicropolarFoam utilizes a transient approach and the PISO algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling, adopting the low-magnetic-Reynolds-number approximation for the MHD phenomena. It also accounts for micropolar effects, incorporating the force term arising from the microrotation-vorticity difference in the momentum equation, and solves the internal angular momentum equation. EpotMMRFoam is a modification of epotMicropolarFoam to include the MMR term in the internal angular momentum equation, while a constitutive magnetization equation is also solved. Validation was conducted against analytical solutions of MHD micropolar Poiseuille blood flow, demonstrating excellent accuracy (error &lt; 2%) for both solvers. When the MMR term is included, velocity and microrotation were significantly reduced (up to 40% and 99.9%, respectively), particularly under strong magnetic fields and high hematocrit values. In the absence of MMR, magnetic effects were minimal due to the blood's relatively low conductivity and small vessel size. MHD 3D artery blood flow simulations confirmed similar trends. The solvers exhibit strong potential for biomedical applications such as magnetic hyperthermia and targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>A novel hybrid neural network of fluid-structure interaction prediction for two cylinders in tandem arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown promise in improving computing efficiency while ensuring modeling accuracy in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis. However, its current capabilities are limited when it comes to constructing multi-object coupling systems with dynamic boundaries. To address such limitation, a novel FSI neural solver integrated by a fluid deep learning model with multi-time steps and a structural dynamic solver is proposed to accurately and reliably predict the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) evolution for two cylinders in tandem. This well-designed model in the form of end-to-end can precisely predict the instantaneous flow field state at the subsequent time by coupling the temporal flow fields of historical multi-time sequences and the current structural responses, moreover, derives the structural state at the next time. Furthermore, the novel fluid deep learning model consists of a wall shear model utilizing a multilayer perception network and flow field model with U-shaped architecture jointing the Fourier neural operator and modified convolution long-short term memory model. Both models effectively capture coupling transfer forces and predict instantaneous flow fields, with the latter demonstrating superior accuracy compared to Convolutional Neural Network- or Unet- based models with similar parameters. The prediction speed of the proposed models realizes an improvement of over 1000 times compared with the numerical simulation. Significantly, the proposed FSI neural model demonstrates exceptional capability in constructing the nonlinear complex multi- vibration systems and has substantial potential for advancing FSI modeling of flexible structures featuring pronounced nonlinear deformation boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy with the non-Abelian gauge helicities conserved in time for ``null fields", that we have defined previously, in this paper we first define non-Abelian fluid helicities and then total non-Abelian helicities for combined non-Abelian fluid and gauge fields. For a U(N) group the helicities considered are for both gluonic-type fluids, composed of particles in the adjoint representation, and quark-type fluids, in the $N$-dimensional Cartan subalgebra. We write down various Lagrangian formulations for the uncoupled and coupled systems. In each case we determine the equations of motion, symmetries, and a Hamiltonian formulation. Taking the velocity of the fluid in the adjoint representation, we find that in the case of the gluonic fluid, we can write a non-Abelian gluonic fluid Euler-Yang-Mills equation that conserves the defined helicities, and comes from a Lagrangian.</description>
