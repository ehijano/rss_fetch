      <title>Towards Digital Twins in PSMA-targeted Radiopharmaceutical Therapies: Predictive Dosimetry Guided by Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive dosimetry is central to enabling personalization of radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs) such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted RPTs. This study integrates physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling with machine learning (ML) to predict physical (AUC, Dose) and biological (BED, EQD2) dosimetry in tumors and five organs. Using 640 realistically generated virtual patients, we simulated 15,360 time-activity curves (TACs) reflecting diverse uptake patterns. TAC-derived features trained ML models (RF, ET, Ridge, GB, XGBoost), with performance evaluated by Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). SHAP analysis identified key feature contributions varying by organ, endpoint, and tumor volume. Cu-64 based imaging yielded the most robust predictions, with dose prediction MAPE as low as 8% for tumors and 10-20% for different organs, while F-18 showed strong but more volume-dependent trends, and Ga-68 exhibited higher variability. The proposed PBPK-ML virtual theranostic trial framework enables robust predictive dosimetry and clinical trial design and optimization, advancing personalized planning for PSMA-targeted RPTs.</description>

      <title>Light-sheet microscopy to assess cancer pathology: current views and future trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing cancer tissue samples, including patient-derived specimens, organoids, biopsies, and murine models. In this work, we highlight the current applications of deep tissue LSFM in oncology and illustrate its use across a variety of human cancer tissues, including - but not limited to - prostate and breast. Here, we discuss that the potential integration of advanced LSFM technologies into clinical workflows to enable high-throughput, three-dimensional imaging of intact cancer specimens. This approach holds significant potential to enhance diagnostic precision and provide novel insights into tumour architecture and morphology.</description>

      <title>Patient-specific AI for generation of 3D dosimetry imaging from two 2D-planar measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explored the use of patient specific reinforced learning to generate 3D activity maps from two 2D planar images (anterior and posterior). The solution of this problem remains unachievable using conventional methodologies and is of particular interest for dosimetry in nuclear medicine where approaches for post-therapy distribution of radiopharmaceuticals such as 177Lu-PSMA are typically done via either expensive and long 3D SPECT acquisitions or fast, yet only 2D, planar scintigraphy. Being able to generate 3D activity maps from planar scintigraphy opens the gate for new dosimetry applications removing the need for SPECT and facilitating multi-time point dosimetry studies. Our solution comprises the generation of a patient specific dataset with possible 3D uptake maps of the radiopharmaceuticals withing the anatomy of the individual followed by an AI approach (we explored both the use of 3DUnet and diffusion models) able to generate 3D activity maps from 2D planar images. We have validated our method both in simulation and real planar acquisitions. We observed enhanced results using patient specific reinforcement learning (~20% reduction on MAE and ~5% increase in SSIM) and better organ delineation and patient anatomy especially when combining diffusion models with patient specific training yielding a SSIM=0.89 compared to the ground truth for simulations and 0.73 when compared to a SPECT acquisition performed half an hour after the planar. We believe that our methodology can set a change of paradigm for nuclear medicine dosimetry allowing for 3D quantification using only planar scintigraphy without the need of expensive and time-consuming SPECT leveraging the pre-therapy information of the patients.</description>

      <title>Feed-forward active magnetic shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields from the brain are tiny relative to ambient fields which therefore need to be suppressed. The common solution of passive shielding is expensive, bulky and insufficiently effective, thus motivating research into the alternative of active shielding which comes in two flavours: feed-back and feed-forward. In feed-back designs (the most common), corrective fields are created by coils driven from sensors within the area that they correct, for example from the main sensors of an MEG device. In feed-forward designs (less common), corrective fields are driven from dedicated reference sensors outside the area they correct. Feed-forward can achieve better performance than feed-back, in principle, however its implementation is hobbled by an unavoidable coupling between coils and reference sensors, which reduces the effectiveness of the shielding and may affect stability, complicating the design. This paper suggests a solution that relies on a ``decoupling matrix," inserted in the signal pathway between sensors and corrective coils, to counteract the spurious coupling. This allows feed-forward shielding do reduce the ambient field to zero across the full frequency range, in principle, although performance may be limited by other factors such as current noise. The solution, which is fully data-driven and does not require geometric calculations, high-tolerance fabrication, or physical calibration, has been evaluated by simulation, but not implemented in hardware. It might contribute to the deployment of a new generation of measurement systems based on optically-pumped magnetometers (OPM). The lower cost and reduced constraints of those systems are a strong incentive to likewise reduce the cost and constraints of the shielding required to operate them, hence the appeal of active shielding.</description>

      <title>A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures, precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence, extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation. Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.</description>
