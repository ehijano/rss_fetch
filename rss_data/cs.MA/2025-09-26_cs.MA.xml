      <title>Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference &amp; Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.</description>

      <title>RadAgents: Multimodal Agentic Reasoning for Chest X-ray Interpretation with Radiologist-like Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused, yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts, resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Fairy: Interactive Mobile Assistant to Real-world Tasks via LMM-based Multi-agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However, existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory, achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7% and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its interaction and self-learning.</description>

      <title>A Category Theoretic Approach to Approximate Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper uses category theory to develop an entirely new approach to approximate game theory. Game theory is the study of how different agents within a multi-agent system take decisions. At its core, game theory asks what an optimal decision is in a given scenario. Thus approximate game theory asks what is an approximately optimal decision in a given scenario. This is important in practice as -- just like in much of computing -- exact answers maybe too difficult to compute or even impossible to compute given inherent uncertainty in input.
  We consider first "Selection Functions" which are functions and develop a simple yet robust model of approximate equilibria. We develop the algebraic properties of approximation wrt selection functions and also relate approximation to the compositional structure of selection functions. We then repeat this process successfully for Open Games -- a more advanced model of game theory.</description>

      <title>Study on Locomotive Epidemic Dynamics in a Stochastic Spatio-Temporal Simulation Model on a Multiplex Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an integrated approach to understanding epidemic dynamics through a stochastic spatio-temporal simulation model on a multiplex network, blending physical and informational layers. The physical layer maps the geographic movement of individuals, while the information layer tracks the spread of knowledge and health behavior via social interactions. We explore the interplay between physical mobility, information flow, and epidemic outcomes by simulating disease spread within this dual-structured network. Our model employs stochastic elements to mirror human behavior, mobility, and information dissemination uncertainties. Through simulations, we assess the impact of network structure, mobility patterns, and information spread speed on epidemic dynamics. The findings highlight the crucial role of effective communication in curbing disease transmission, even in highly mobile societies. Additionally, our agent-based simulation allows for real-time scenario analysis through a user interface, offering insights into leveraging physical and informational networks for epidemic control. This research sheds light on designing strategic interventions in complex social systems to manage disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose **T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18% improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.</description>

      <title>AbideGym: Turning Static RL Worlds into Adaptive Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agents trained with reinforcement learning often develop brittle policies that fail when dynamics shift, a problem amplified by static benchmarks. AbideGym, a dynamic MiniGrid wrapper, introduces agent-aware perturbations and scalable complexity to enforce intra-episode adaptation. By exposing weaknesses in static policies and promoting resilience, AbideGym provides a modular, reproducible evaluation framework for advancing research in curriculum learning, continual learning, and robust generalization.</description>

      <title>Collab-Overcooked: Benchmarking and Evaluating Large Language Models as Collaborative Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agent systems have made great strides in real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. This paper proposes a new LLM-based Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks in two novel ways. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments with 13 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs exhibit a strong ability in goal interpretation, there are significant shortcomings in active collaboration and continuous adaptation, which are critical for efficiently fulfilling complex tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-source benchmark. The environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and the evaluation package are publicly available at https://github.com/YusaeMeow/Collab-Overcooked.</description>

      <title>Language-Guided Multi-Agent Learning in Simulations: A Unified Framework and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Aegis: Automated Error Generation and Identification for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex, understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at https://kfq20.github.io/AEGIS-Website.</description>
