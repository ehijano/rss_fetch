      <title>Resonant emittance mixing of flat beams in plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma accelerators sustain large field gradients and could enable future compact linear colliders. To achieve the required high luminosity, linear colliders rely on flat beams to avoid potentially deleterious beamstrahlung effects. Here, we show that flat beams in plasma accelerators can be subject to beam quality degradation due to emittance mixing caused by transverse coupling in the wakefields. When there is a resonance between the betatron oscillations in the horizontal and vertical planes for the beam particles in a coupled wakefield, the transverse emittances fully exchange, leading to a round beam. Depending on the mechanism causing the resonance, the use of laser drivers, flat particle beam drivers, or hollow plasma channels can avoid the resonance and mitigate the emittance deterioration.</description>

      <title>An asymmetric four-bend S-chicane compressor immune to coherent synchrotron radiation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most significant advances in x-ray free electron lasers (FELs) have been driven by the development of ingenious bunch compressors and high-brightness sources in the last several decades. Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is considered a disruptive effect that hinders the reach of design targets, and its control is of essential importance for bunch compression to avoid beam phase-space quality degradation, especially transverse emittance dilution. Herein, we demonstrate a design to cancel the CSR-driven emittance excitation by arranging four adjacent bends into an asymmetric S-chicane without any use of additional components. The CSR-induced emittance growth of the proposed chicane is found to be drastically reduced by nearly one order of magnitude compared with the nominal symmetric C-chicane by particle tracking simulation. This breakthrough opens the door for the bunch compressors to meet the ever-increasing demands of future accelerator applications, especially important in the field of FELs.</description>

      <title>High-energy polarized electron beams from the ionization of isolated spin polarized hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a laser-based method for the preparation of high-energy, highly-polarized electrons, from the ionization of isolated spin-polarized hydrogen (SPH) atoms. The SPH atoms are prepared from the photodissociation of HBr, using two consecutive shaped UV pulses of ps duration. By appropriately timing and focusing the pulses, we can spatially separate the highly polarized SPH from other unwanted photoproducts, which then act as the target for the ion-acceleration lasers. The density of SPH can surpass $\approx$10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, allowing the production of GeV electrons with polarization larger than 90%.</description>

      <title>Collective nuclear excitation dynamics in mono-modal x-ray waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles of identical atoms exhibit peculiar collective properties in their interaction with radiation depending on geometry and environment where they are embedded in. A remarkably clean and versatile platform to study collective effects in resonant light scattering are M\"ossbauer nuclei placed in planar x-ray waveguides. Here we conceive and demonstrate experimentally distinct temporal emission characteristics in these systems, ranging from a tunable accelerated exponential decay all the way to a pronounced oscillatory emission pattern, depending on the waveguide geometry and mode of excitation. The observed temporal and spatial emission characteristics of the collectively excited nuclear state in the waveguide -- the nuclear exciton -- are well reproduced by a unified theoretical model. Our findings pave the way for applications ranging from fundamental studies of cooperative emission at hard x-ray frequencies up to new methods of narrowband x-ray control via the engineering of collective radiation patterns.</description>
