      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Half Landau-Zener ramp to a quantum phase transition in a dissipative single spin sodel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a single spin coupled to a bosonic bath at zero temperature driven by a ramp of the bias field. A single spin coupled to a bosonic sub-Ohmic bath exhibits a quantum phase transition at a certain strength of spin-boson coupling. When the bias field is ramped from a large value to zero at this critical coupling strength, the system initialized at the ground state ends up with a finite magnetization due to the critical slowing down near the transition. On the basis of the pulse-impulse approximation, we derive a scaling law between the residual magnetization and the ramp speed. The obtained scaling relation is examined using a numerical simulation based on the tensor network. The data are in favor of the scaling law to hold. We discuss the demonstration of our theoretical results by means of quantum simulation using the quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Quantum scars in many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos makes isolated systems of many interacting particles quickly thermalize and forget about their past. Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos in many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly entangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged weight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and despite the system being fully thermal. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum scarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models, including some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our findings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of chaos in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of a universal phase diagram of $k$-local quantum chains subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment, which exhibits "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert space fragmented phases as charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that for any $d$, any state for $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages": local regions across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. We prove that this implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov sectors that each form an exponentially-vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically-disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical states at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement scaling, with rare "inverse quantum many-body scar" states featuring non-area-law scaling. We then numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We also study the critical scaling of the dimensions of various Krylov sectors at $\nu=\nu_c$, as well as investigate the properties of certain special case models for which no phase transitions occur.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the mechanism of helium evaporation from liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evaporation of trace amounts of helium solvated in liquid water using molecular dynamics simulations and theory. Consistent with experimental observations, we find a super-Maxwellian distribution of kinetic energies of evaporated helium. This excess of kinetic energy over typical thermal expectations is explained by an effective continuum theory of evaporation based on a Fokker-Planck equation, parameterized molecularly by a potential of mean force and position-dependent friction. Using this description, we find that helium evaporation is strongly influenced by the friction near the interface, which is anomalously small near the Gibbs dividing surface due to the ability of the liquid-vapor interface to deform around the gas particle. Our reduced description provides a mechanistic interpretation of trace gas evaporation as the motion of an underdamped particle in a potential subject to a viscous environment that varies rapidly across the air-water interface. From it we predict the temperature dependence of the excess kinetic energy of evaporation, which is yet to be measured.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical Approach to Calculating Mechanical Stresses in Inhomogeneous Ionic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This extended article presents a thermomechanical approach for calculating the stress tensor from the thermodynamic potential of ionic fluids. Our technique, which is based on the invariance of the thermodynamic potential with respect to spatial transformations of shear and rotation, offers an alternative to the general covariant approach recently developed by two of us. We apply this technique in both pure mean field theories of ionic fluids and in a theory that includes thermal fluctuations of the electrostatic potential, using variational field theory. We also apply the thermomechanical approach to fluid models described by vector order parameters, such as liquid dielectrics, and obtained for this case a general expression for the stress tensor. Additionally, we discuss specific issues related to the calculation of disjoining pressure in ionic fluids confined in nanoscale slit-like pores with conductive or dielectric walls.</description>

      <title>Tensor tree learns hidden relational structures in data to construct generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the tensor tree network with the Born machine framework, we propose a general method for constructing a generative model by expressing the target distribution function as the quantum wave function amplitude represented by a tensor tree. The key idea is dynamically optimizing the tree structure that minimizes the bond mutual information. The proposed method offers enhanced performance and uncovers hidden relational structures in the target data. We illustrate potential practical applications with four examples: (i) random patterns, (ii) QMNIST hand-written digits, (iii) Bayesian networks, and (iv) the stock price fluctuation pattern in S&amp;P500. In (i) and (ii), strongly correlated variables were concentrated near the center of the network; in (iii), the causality pattern was identified; and, in (iv), a structure corresponding to the eleven sectors emerged.</description>

      <title>Non-linear classification capability of quantum neural networks due to emergent quantum metastability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power and expressivity of deep classical neural networks can be attributed to non-linear input-output relations. Such non-linearities are at the heart of many computational tasks, such as data classification and pattern recognition. Quantum neural networks, on the other hand, are necessarily linear as they process information via unitary operations. Here we show that effective non-linearities can be implemented in these platforms by exploiting the relationship between information processing and many-body quantum dynamics. The crucial point is that quantum many-body systems can show emergent collective behavior in the vicinity of phase transitions, which leads to an effectively non-linear dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. In the context of quantum neural networks, which are necessarily finite, this translates into metastability with transient non-ergodic behavior. By using a quantum neural network whose architecture is inspired by dissipative many-body quantum spin models, we show that this mechanism indeed allows to realize non-linear data classification, despite the underlying dynamics being local and linear. Our proof-of-principle study may pave the way for the systematic construction of quantum neural networks with emergent non-linear properties.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of the Structure, Thermodynamics, and Shear Elasticity of Deeply Metastable Hard Sphere Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure, thermodynamics and slow activated dynamics of the equilibrated metastable regime of glass-forming fluids remains a poorly understood problem of high theoretical and experimental interest. We apply a highly accurate microscopic equilibrium liquid state integral equation theory that has not been previously explored in the deeply metastable regime, in conjunction with na\"ive mode coupling theory of particle localization, to study in a unified manner the structural correlations, thermodynamic properties, and dynamic elastic shear modulus in deeply metastable hard sphere fluids. New and distinctive behaviors are predicted including divergent inverse critical power laws for the contact value of the pair correlation function, pressure, and inverse dimensionless compressibility, and a splitting of the second peak and large suppression of interstitial configurations of the pair correlation function. The dynamic elastic modulus is predicted to exhibit two distinct exponential growth regimes with packing fraction that have strongly different slopes. These new thermodynamic, structural, and elastic modulus results are consistent with simulations and experiments. Perhaps most unexpectedly, connections between the amplitude of long wavelength density fluctuations, dimensionless compressibility, local structure, and the dynamic elastic shear modulus are discovered. These connections are more broadly relevant to understand the slow activated relaxation and mechanical response of colloidal suspensions in the ultra-dense metastable region and deeply supercooled thermal liquids in equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for characterizing the localization properties of wave functions. Despite its utility, this tool has been predominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the tree geometry induces multifractal statistics for the single-particle skin states on the Cayley tree. This sharply contrasts with the absence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin effects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the skin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing multifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Leapover Lengths of L\'evy Flights with Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional search process under stochastic resetting conditions. A target is located at $b\geq0$ and a searcher, starting from the origin, performs a discrete-time random walk with independent jumps drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. Before each jump, there is a given probability $r$ of restarting the walk from the initial position. The efficiency of a "myopic search" - in which the search stops upon crossing the target for the first time - is usually characterized in terms of the first-passage time $\tau$. On the other hand, great relevance is encapsulated by the leapover length $l = x_{\tau} - b$, which measures how far from the target the search ends. For symmetric heavy-tailed jump distributions, in the absence of resetting the average leapover is always infinite. Here we show instead that resetting induces a finite average leapover $\ell_b(r)$ if the mean jump length is finite. We compute exactly $\ell_b(r)$ and determine the condition under which resetting allows for nontrivial optimization, i.e., for the existence of $r^*$ such that $\ell_b(r^*)$ is minimal and smaller than the average leapover of the single jump.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of characterizing the different thermalization pathways through a large-deviation approach. Specifically, we consider clean, disordered and quasi-periodic harmonic chains under energy and momentum-conserving noise. For their associated master equations, describing the dynamics of normal modes energies, we compute the fluctuations of activity and dynamical entropy in the corresponding biased ensembles. First-order dynamical phase transition are found that originates from different activity regions in action space. At the transitions, the steady-state in the biased ensembles changes from extended to localized, yielding a kind of condensation in normal-modes space. For the disordered and quasi-periodic models, we argue that the phase-diagram has a critical point at a finite value of the disorder or potential strength.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents of correlated percolation of sites not visited by a random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a $d$-dimensional correlated percolation problem of sites {\em not} visited by a random walk on a hypercubic lattice $L^d$ for $d=3$, 4 and 5. The length of the random walk is ${\cal N}=uL^d$. Close to the critical value $u=u_c$, many geometrical properties of the problem can be described as powers (critical exponents) of $u_c-u$, such as $\beta$, which controls the strength of the spanning cluster, and $\gamma$, which characterizes the behavior of the mean finite cluster size $S$. We show that at $u_c$ the ratio between the mean mass of the largest cluster $M_1$ and the mass of the second largest cluster $M_2$ is independent of $L$ and can be used to find $u_c$. We calculate $\beta$ from the $L$-dependence of $M_2$ and $\gamma$ from the finite size scaling of $S$. The resulting exponent $\beta$ remains close to 1 in all dimensions. The exponent $\gamma$ decreases from $\approx 3.9$ in $d=3$ to $\approx1.9$ in $d=4$ and $\approx 1.3$ in $d=5$ towards $\gamma=1$ expected in $d=6$, which is close to $\gamma=4/(d-2)$.</description>

Abstract: Several closely related ab initio thermal mean-field theories for fermions, both well-established and new ones, are compared with one another at the formalism level and numerically. The theories considered are Fermi-Dirac theory, thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, two modifications of the thermal single-determinant approximation of Kaplan and Argyres, and first-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory based on zero-temperature or thermal HF reference. The thermal full-configuration-interaction theory is used as the benchmark.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transition between topological phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model composed of springs and masses in which the intracellular Aubry-Andr\'e disorder modulates the spring constants. We analytically compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix for both periodic and fixed boundary conditions, and compare them with the dispersion spectrum of the original tight-binding SSH model. We observe the presence of a topological Anderson insulating (TAI) phase within a specific range of quasi-periodic modulation strength and calculate the phase transition boundary analytically. We examine the localization properties of normal modes using their inverse participation ratio (IPR) of eigenstates of the dynamical matrix, and the corresponding fractal dimension associated with quasiperiodic modulation. We also examine the stability of the TAI phase across a range of modulation strengths and comments on the presence of mobility edge that separate localized modes from non-localized ones. We demonstrate the fact that special analytical techniques are needed to compute an exact expression for mobility edges in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate correlations, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and quantum information dynamics in chaotic many-body quantum systems</title>

Abstract: We consider the statistical properties of eigenstates of the time-evolution operator in chaotic many-body quantum systems. Our focus is on correlations between eigenstates that are specific to spatially extended systems and that characterise entanglement dynamics and operator spreading. In order to isolate these aspects of dynamics from those arising as a result of local conservation laws, we consider Floquet systems in which there are no conserved densities. The correlations associated with scrambling of quantum information lie outside the standard framework established by the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH). In particular, ETH provides a statistical description of matrix elements of local operators between pairs of eigenstates, whereas the aspects of dynamics we are concerned with arise from correlations amongst sets of four or more eigenstates. We establish the simplest correlation function that captures these correlations and discuss features of its behaviour that are expected to be universal at long distances and low energies. We also propose a maximum-entropy Ansatz for the joint distribution of a small number $n$ of eigenstates. In the case $n = 2$ this Ansatz reproduces ETH. For $n = 4$ it captures both the growth with time of entanglement between subsystems, as characterised by the purity of the time-evolution operator, and also operator spreading, as characterised by the behaviour of the out-of-time-order correlator. We test these ideas by comparing results from Monte Carlo sampling of our Ansatz with exact diagonalisation studies of Floquet quantum circuits.</description>
