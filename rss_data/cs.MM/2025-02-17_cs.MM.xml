      <title>MuDoC: An Interactive Multimodal Document-grounded Conversational AI System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal AI is an important step towards building effective tools to leverage multiple modalities in human-AI communication. Building a multimodal document-grounded AI system to interact with long documents remains a challenge. Our work aims to fill the research gap of directly leveraging grounded visuals from documents alongside textual content in documents for response generation. We present an interactive conversational AI agent 'MuDoC' based on GPT-4o to generate document-grounded responses with interleaved text and figures. MuDoC's intelligent textbook interface promotes trustworthiness and enables verification of system responses by allowing instant navigation to source text and figures in the documents. We also discuss qualitative observations based on MuDoC responses highlighting its strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Concept-based Deep Learning Framework for Multimodal Human Behavior Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the contemporary era of intelligent connectivity, Affective Computing (AC), which enables systems to recognize, interpret, and respond to human behavior states, has become an integrated part of many AI systems. As one of the most critical components of responsible AI and trustworthiness in all human-centered systems, explainability has been a major concern in AC. Particularly, the recently released EU General Data Protection Regulation requires any high-risk AI systems to be sufficiently interpretable, including biometric-based systems and emotion recognition systems widely used in the affective computing field. Existing explainable methods often compromise between interpretability and performance. Most of them focus only on highlighting key network parameters without offering meaningful, domain-specific explanations to the stakeholders. Additionally, they also face challenges in effectively co-learning and explaining insights from multimodal data sources. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalizable framework, namely the Attention-Guided Concept Model (AGCM), which provides learnable conceptual explanations by identifying what concepts that lead to the predictions and where they are observed. AGCM is extendable to any spatial and temporal signals through multimodal concept alignment and co-learning, empowering stakeholders with deeper insights into the model's decision-making process. We validate the efficiency of AGCM on well-established Facial Expression Recognition benchmark datasets while also demonstrating its generalizability on more complex real-world human behavior understanding applications.</description>

      <title>Video Soundtrack Generation by Aligning Emotions and Temporal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EMSYNC, a video-based symbolic music generation model that aligns music with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate and align musical chords with scene cuts. Unlike existing models, our approach retains event-based encoding, ensuring fine-grained timing control and expressive musical nuances. We also propose a mapping scheme to bridge the video emotion classifier, which produces discrete emotion categories, with the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, which operates on continuous-valued valence-arousal inputs. In subjective listening tests, EMSYNC outperforms state-of-the-art models across all subjective metrics, for music theory-aware participants as well as the general listeners.</description>

      <title>VocalCrypt: Novel Active Defense Against Deepfake Voice Based on Masking Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in AI voice cloning, fueled by machine learning, have significantly impacted text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) fields. While these developments have led to notable progress, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of AI VC technology, causing economic losses and negative public perceptions. To address this challenge, this study focuses on creating active defense mechanisms against AI VC systems.
  We propose a novel active defense method, VocalCrypt, which embeds pseudo-timbre (jamming information) based on SFS into audio segments that are imperceptible to the human ear, thereby forming systematic fragments to prevent voice cloning. This approach protects the voice without compromising its quality. In comparison to existing methods, such as adversarial noise incorporation, VocalCrypt significantly enhances robustness and real-time performance, achieving a 500\% increase in generation speed while maintaining interference effectiveness.
  Unlike audio watermarking techniques, which focus on post-detection, our method offers preemptive defense, reducing implementation costs and enhancing feasibility. Extensive experiments using the Zhvoice and VCTK Corpus datasets show that our AI-cloned speech defense system performs excellently in automatic speaker verification (ASV) tests while preserving the integrity of the protected audio.</description>

      <title>When Video Coding Meets Multimodal Large Language Models: A Unified Paradigm for Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing codecs are designed to eliminate intrinsic redundancies to create a compact representation for compression. However, strong external priors from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not been explicitly explored in video compression. Herein, we introduce a unified paradigm for Cross-Modality Video Coding (CMVC), which is a pioneering approach to explore multimodality representation and video generative models in video coding. Specifically, on the encoder side, we disentangle a video into spatial content and motion components, which are subsequently transformed into distinct modalities to achieve very compact representation by leveraging MLLMs. During decoding, previously encoded components and video generation models are leveraged to create multiple encoding-decoding modes that optimize video reconstruction quality for specific decoding requirements, including Text-Text-to-Video (TT2V) mode to ensure high-quality semantic information and Image-Text-to-Video (IT2V) mode to achieve superb perceptual consistency. In addition, we propose an efficient frame interpolation model for IT2V mode via Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) tuning to guarantee perceptual quality, which allows the generated motion cues to behave smoothly. Experiments on benchmarks indicate that TT2V achieves effective semantic reconstruction, while IT2V exhibits competitive perceptual consistency. These results highlight potential directions for future research in video coding.</description>
