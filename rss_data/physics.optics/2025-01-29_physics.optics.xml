      <title>Phase-matched electron-photon interactions enabled by 3D-printed helical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Smith-Purcell effect enables electromagnetic radiation across arbitrary spectral ranges by phase-matching the diffraction orders of an optical grating with the near-field of a moving electron. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using a helically shaped waveguide, where phase-matching is achieved through guided light within a helical optical fiber fabricated via two-photon polymerization using a 3D printer. Our results demonstrate that radiation from these structures precisely satisfies the phase-matching condition and is emitted directionally at specific angles, contrasting with the broad angular distribution characteristic of the traditional Smith-Purcell effect. Helical electron-driven photon sources establish a new paradigm, enabling 3D-printed structures to control electron-beam-induced radiation and, inversely, to facilitate light-induced efficient electron beam shaping and acceleration.</description>

      <title>Laser-based aberration corrector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aberration correctors are essential elements for achieving atomic resolution in state-of-the-art electron microscopes. Conventional correctors are based on a series of multipolar electron lenses, but more versatile alternatives are intensively sought. Here we suggest spatially tailored intense laser pulses as one such alternative. Our simulations demonstrate that the free-space electron-photon interaction can be used to compensate for spherical and chromatic aberrations of subsequent electron lenses. We show a significant improvement in the simulated electron probe sizes and discuss the prospects of utilizing the tailored laser fields as a platform for novel electron optics in ultrafast electron microscope setups.</description>

      <title>Optimizing electro-optic modulators for interfacing color centers in an integrated silicon carbide platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide is a promising material platform for hosting various color centers suitable for quantum information processing. Here, we report for the first time the design and demonstration of an integrated electro-optic modulator that can directly interface the silicon vacancy centers in the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator platform. Despite a relatively low electro-optic coefficient ($0.22$ pm/V), the optimized silicon carbide modulator is able to work in the 920 nm range with a propagation loss of less than $0.5$ dB/cm, featuring an a 3-dB bandwidth around 500 MHz, an extinction ratio of 8-12 dB for an operating peak-to-peak voltage of 10 V, and a footprint of less than $0.1\ \text{mm}^2$. With such modulation performance, our work provides a cost-effective solution for the chip-scale implementation of the electro-optic modulation technology for interfacing color centers in the silicon carbide platform.</description>

      <title>Compact, widely tunable ultrashort burst pulse generator using four mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort burst laser pulses serve as powerful tools for precise laser processing, broadband ultrafast spectroscopy, and high-speed laser-scanning microscopy. However, the performance of conventional burst pulse generators is limited by constraints in the pulse time interval variability, pulse energy variability, pulse number variability, and overall system complexity. Here, we present a compact burst pulse generator that offers a broad tuning range for pulse time intervals, along with control over the number of pulses and pulse energies within the burst. It consists of four mirrors, two of which are parallel to each other, and outputs pulses that are equally spaced both temporally and spatially. We demonstrated the generation of a burst laser pulse by shaping a single ultrashort laser pulse into six pulses with time intervals ranging from femtoseconds to nanoseconds. The pulse time intervals and energies were consistent with theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast neuromorphic computing with nanophotonic optical parametric oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has led to disruptive advancements in fundamental sciences and everyday technologies. Among various machine learning algorithms, deep neural networks have become instrumental in revealing complex patterns in large datasets with key applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. On-chip photonic neural networks offer a promising platform that leverage high bandwidths and low propagation losses associated with optical signals to perform analog computations for deep learning. However, nanophotonic circuits are yet to achieve the required linear and nonlinear operations simultaneously in an all-optical and ultrafast fashion. Here, we report an ultrafast nanophotonic neuromorphic processor using an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) fabricated on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). The input data is used to modulate the optical pulses synchronously pumping the OPO. The consequent signal pulses generated by the OPO are coupled to one another via the nonlinear delayed dynamics of the OPO, thus forming the internal nodes of a deep recurrent neural network. We use such a nonlinearly coupled OPO network for chaotic time series prediction, nonlinear error correction in a noisy communication channel, as well as noisy waveform classification and achieve accuracies exceeding 93% at an operating clock rate of ~ 10 GHz. Our OPO network is capable of achieving sub-nanosecond latencies, a timescale comparable to a single clock cycle in state-of-the-art digital electronic processors. By circumventing the need for optical-electronic-optical (OEO) conversions, our ultrafast nanophotonic neural network paves the way for the next generation of compact all-optical neuromorphic processors with ultralow latencies and high energy efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Intensity correlations in transmission and four-wave mixing signals intermediated by hot rubidium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the distribution of atom velocities in a hot rubidium sample on the correlation between field-intensity fluctuations of two independently generated four-wave mixing signals and between the transmission signals. The nonlinear process is driven by a single cw laser in a pure two-level system due to the forward geometry with circular and parallel polarization of the input fields. The intensity cross-correlations of the four-wave mixing signals and the transmission signals present an oscillatory behavior with a clear dependence on the power of the incident fields, which indicates a connection with Rabi oscillations. A two-level theoretical model using stochastic differential equations to account for the mechanism of conversion of phase noise into amplitude noise shows good agreement with our experimental results. Moreover, we show how the response of the system is affected by the different atomic velocity groups.</description>

      <title>Optical centroid orbiting metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical interferometry has dramatically advanced the development of modern science and technology. Here we introduce an interesting centroid evolution phenomenon of orbital angular momentum (OAM) interference fields with broken rotational symmetry, and establish a novel interferometric paradigm by fully exploiting centroid orbiting information. The centroid positions and their geometric trajectories can provide more detectable information in a two-dimensional plane to sense the interferometric perturbations, compared with the conventional interferometry. We first investigate centroid orbital evolution under the inclined angle perturbation that allows for ultra-sensitive angle distinguishment with arc-second resolution. We also show centroid ellipse evolution under spatial phase perturbation that enables geometric characterization of arbitrary OAM superpositions on modal Poincar\'e spheres. Furthermore, based on the angle subdivision of centroid orbiting, we demonstrate the environmentally robust nanoscale displacement measurement with polarization synchronous detection, and particularly the high-resolution, fast, and large-range linear movement monitoring using commercial four-quadrant photodetectors. This novel centroid orbiting interferometry may open new opportunities to advance metrological technologies beyond the conventional interferometers.</description>

      <title>Optical Skyrmions of Vortex Darkness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We disclose the existence of a type of optical skyrmion, Gauss-Stokes (GS) skyrmions, that is naturally present in an optical vortex around its phase singularity. Contrary to previous research with optical skyrmions, we neither shape vector beams nor superpose different spatial modes and polarizations. In GS skyrmions, the phase singularity in the transversal field of a single monochromatic beam of uniform polarization (a scalar beam) is concealed by the axial field dictated by Gauss's divergence law, giving rise to a polarization singularity of undefined polarization plane. This singularity is enclosed by a rich skyrmionic polarization texture fulfilling a topological map and covering all the states of transverse-axial polarization. In our experiment, we facilitate the observation of a GS skyrmion with the predicted features using focused fields with enhanced axial component.</description>

      <title>Optically trapped exciton-polariton condensates in a perovskite microcavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate room temperature optical trapping and generation of high-order angular harmonics in exciton-polariton condensates in a monocrystalline CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite-filled microcavity. Using an annular nonresonant excitation profile focused onto the perovskite, we observed power-driven switching between different transverse modes of the optically induced trap. We explore the interplay between the perovskite crystal dimensions and the optical trap diameter that allows the condensate to transition from whispering gallery-like petal shapes to extended ripple states. Our results underline the feasibility in creating high-order quantum states in perovskite polariton condensates for reconfigurable and structured room temperature nonlinear lasing.</description>

      <title>Self-modulated multimode silicon cavity optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode cavity optomechanics, where multiple mechanical degrees of freedom couple to optical cavity modes, provides a rich platform for exploring nonlinear dynamics and engineering complex interactions. In this work, we investigate the interplay between two mechanical modes with similar characteristics and a self-induced nonlinear modulation of intra-cavity power (self-pulsing) driven by free-carrier dispersion and thermo-optic effects in silicon. Notably, the self-pulsing dynamics adapts to the optomechanically induced perturbations from both mechanical modes, enabling simultaneous synchronous pumping and driving them into a stable state characterized by high-amplitude, self-sustained, and coherent oscillations. This result effectively overcomes the strong mode competition typically observed in modes with similar spatial distributions and frequency scales. Remarkably, this regime is achieved even when the mechanical frequencies do not satisfy a harmonic relation, leading to quasi-periodic or chaotic intra-cavity power dynamics, while the mechanical modes maintain coherent, high-amplitude oscillations. These results, supported by a numerical model that accurately predicts the dynamics of the system, open new pathways for the generation and control of multi-phonon coherent sources in chip-integrated silicon platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Low threshold integrated optical parametric oscillator with a compact Bragg resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) have been studied as basic components for optical computing with phase encoding and Ising machines. Integrated photonics offers a scalable solution to incorporate a progressively larger number of devices towards a functional computing module. Among the available platforms, lithium niobate on insulator is an excellent candidate for this goal thanks to its large second order nonlinearity, which can be leveraged via periodic poling of the thin film. In this work, we show a device with a 2.5 mW threshold for parametric oscillation, which is the lowest reported to date among double-resonant OPOs. We use a novel configuration with a Fabry-P\'erot cavity, which reduces the footprint compared to a typical ring resonator by a factor 10. Tuning our devices using pump wavelength and local heating, we can operate the oscillators at degeneracy, which is crucial for logical operations requiring phase bistability. Our results showcase the device as an ideal building block for phase-encoded integrated optical computing, enabling spatial multiplexing with reduced footprint and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present a novel implementation of delay line free reservoir computing based on state-of-the-art photonic technologies, which exploits chaotic optical frequency comb formation in optical microresonator as the nonlinear reservoir. Our solution leverages the high resonator Q-factor both for memory and for enhancing high dimensional nonlinear mapping of input symbols. We numerically demonstrate the accurate prediction of about one thousand symbols in chaotic time series without the need of dedicated optimisation for specific tasks.

      <title>Ultrafast and compact photonic-electronic leaky integrate-and-fire circuits based upon resonant tunnelling diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a first report of ultrafast and compact photonic-electronic neuromorphic temporal leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal circuits built with Resonant Tunnelling Diodes (RTDs). We demonstrate experimentally that multiple fast (~100-200 ps) optical input pulses, arriving within a short (sub-ns long) temporal window, control the triggering of excitable responses in two different photonic-electronic RTD circuit architectures. These architectures are an electronic RTD coupled externally to a photodetector (referred to as a PD-RTD), and an integrated opto-electronic RTD device with inherent photodetection capability at infrared telecom wavelengths (referred to as an Optical RTD-PD). For both RTD systems, we reveal that the high-speed optically-triggered integrate-and-fire spiking operation can be precisely controlled by acting on the voltage bias applied to the RTD devices, or via the intensity of incoming optical pulses. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the leaky integrate-and-fire behaviour to a pattern recognition task at high-speed, with the systems triggering fast ns-long electrical spikes in response to optical inputs of weighted 4-bit digital headers.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology</title>

Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin-topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$-index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain stricter bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental Bismuth realizing higher even nontrivial spin-Chern numbers. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry can be observed experimentally. Finally, we connect spin-bounds to quantum Fisher information and Cram\'er-Rao bounds which are central to quantum metrology, showing that the elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum light by modulated free electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonclassical states of light are fundamental in various applications, spanning quantum computation to enhanced sensing. Fast free electrons, which emit light into photonic structures through the mechanism of spontaneous emission, represent a promising platform for generating diverse types of states. Indeed, the intrinsic connection between the input electron wave function and the output light field suggests that electron-shaping schemes, based on light-induced scattering, facilitates their synthesis. In this article, we present a theoretical framework capable of predicting the final optical density matrix of a generic N-electron state that can also account for post-sample energy filtering. By using such framework, we study the modulation-dependent fluctuations of the N-electron emission and identify regions of Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics. In the single-electron case, we show how coherent states with nearly 90% purity can be formed by pre-filtering a portion of the spectrum after modulation, and how non-Gaussian states are generated after a precise energy measurement. Furthermore, we present a strategy combining a single-stage electron modulation and post-filtering to harness tailored light states, such as squeezed vacuum, cat, and triangular cat states, with fidelity close to 100%.</description>

      <title>Electron dynamics induced by quantum cat-state light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective theory for describing electron dynamics driven by an optical external field in a Schr\"{o}dinger's cat state. We show that the electron density matrix evolves as an average over trajectories $\{\rho_\alpha\}$ weighted by the Sudarshan--Glauber $P$ distribution $P(\alpha)$ in the weak light--matter coupling regime. Each trajectory obeys an equation of motion, $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho_\alpha=\mathcal{H}_{\alpha} \rho_\alpha-\rho_\alpha\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$, where an effective Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$ becomes non-Hermitian due to quantum interference of light. The optical quantum interference is transferred to electrons through the asymmetric action between the ket and bra state vectors in $\rho_{\alpha}$. This non-Hermitian dynamics differs from the conventional one observed in open quantum systems, described by $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho=\mathcal{H}\rho-\rho \mathcal{H}^\dagger$, which has complex conjugation in the second term. We confirm that the results of the effective theory agree with those of full electron--photon system simulations for the few-electron Dicke model, demonstrating experimental accessibility to exotic non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Frequency Reconfigurable Leaky-Wave Antennas with Simplified Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a reconfigurable leaky-waveguide antenna with a simplified biasing scheme for dynamic beam steering at a fixed frequency. Unlike prior metasurface-aided leaky-waveguide antennas that employ tunable metasurfaces as radiative apertures, our approach utilizes them as a waveguide wall solely to control the guided mode. As a result, the proposed structure eliminates the need for local biasing schemes commonly required in earlier designs, significantly simplifying the biasing process. The radiation is achieved by employing passive, angle-independent metasurfaces that allow beam steering across broadside. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design are validated through full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of the system response offers guidance for designing single-component material devices with required properties. A notable phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high concentrations of excitations lacks of comprehensive theoretical framework. Addressing this gap necessitates a discussion grounded in non-linear and multiparticle theories. In this study, we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. Based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steadystate solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The latter is described by the Dicke model and is thus responsible for the generation of the superfluorescent spectral peak. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Two-photon interference between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals scattered off a semiconductor quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) ultimately determines the bandwidth it can offer for quantum information processing. However, no prior experiment has so far been performed to examine the effect of driving detuning on indistinguishability of photons scattered off a TLE, a parameter that is crucial for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference experiments between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.</description>

      <title>Cartesian and spherical multipole expansions in anisotropic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multipole expansion can be formulated in spherical and Cartesian coordinates. By constructing an explicit map linking both formulations in isotropic media, we discover a lack of equivalence between them in anisotropic media. In isotropic media, the Cartesian multipole tensor can be reduced to a spherical tensor containing fewer independent components. In anisotropic media, however, the loss of propagation symmetry prevents this reduction. Consequently, non-harmonic sources radiate fields that can be projected onto a finite set of Cartesian multipole moments but require potentially infinitely many spherical moments. For harmonic sources, the link between the two approaches provides a systematic way to construct the spherical multipole expansion from the Cartesian one. The lack of equivalence between both approaches results in physically significant effects wherever the field propagation includes the Laplace operator. We demonstrate this issue in an electromagnetic radiation inverse problem in anisotropic media, including an analysis of a large-anisotropy regime and an introduction to vector spherical harmonics. We show that the use of the Cartesian approach increases the efficiency and interpretability of the model. The proposed approach opens the door to a broader application of the multipole expansion in anisotropic media.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in 2D Photonics: Analysis and Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes per se are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D problems, but the 2D case is qualitatively different, as the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples in the paper are consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as has also been shown to be true in 1D cases.</description>

      <title>The Hall effects of vortex light in optical materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For light, its spin can be independent of the spatial distribution of its wave function, whereas its intrinsic orbital angular momentum does depend on this distribution. This difference suggests that the spin Hall effect might differ from the orbital Hall effect as light propagates through optical materials. In this paper, we model optical materials as curved space-time and investigate light propagation in two specific materials by solving the covariant Maxwell equations. We find that the trajectory of light with spin $\sigma$ and intrinsic orbital angular momentum $\ell$ deviates from that of light without angular momentum ($\sigma=0$ and $\ell=0$) by an angle $\theta_{\sigma,\ell} \propto 2\sigma+\ell$. In particular, the contribution of spin $\sigma$ to angle $\theta_{\sigma,\ell}$ is twice that of the intrinsic orbital angular momentum $\ell$, highlighting their differing effects on light propagation in optical materials. Furthermore, this angle $\theta_{\sigma,\ell}$ could potentially be observed experimentally, enhancing our understanding of the role of angular momentum in light propagation.</description>

Abstract: Resonance fluorescence of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak monochromatic excitation. These properties are commonly explained in terms of two disjoined pictures, i.e., the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the spectral and correlation properties of the emission. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole resonance fluorescence and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides an intuitive understanding of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of Multimode Squeezed Light Generation in Lossy Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unified theoretical approach to describe the properties of multimode squeezed light generated in a lossy medium is presented. This approach is valid for Markovian environments and includes both a model of discrete losses based on the beamsplitter approach and a generalized continuous loss model based on the spatial Langevin equation. For an important class of Gaussian states, we derive master equations for the second-order correlation functions and illustrate their solution for both frequency-independent and frequency-dependent losses. Studying the mode structure, we demonstrate that in a lossy environment no broadband basis without quadrature correlations between the different broadband modes exists. Therefore, various techniques and strategies to introduce broadband modes can be considered. We show that the Mercer expansion and the Williamson-Euler decomposition do not provide modes in which the maximal squeezing contained in the system can be measured. In turn, we find a new broadband basis that maximizes squeezing in the lossy system and present an algorithm to construct it.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dance of Molecules: Ro-Vibrational Dynamics of Molecules under Intense Illumination at Complex Plasmonic Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.</description>
