      <title>Methylglyoxal induces cardiac dysfunction through mechanisms involving altered intracellular calcium handling in the rat heart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methylglyoxal (MGO) is an endogenous, highly reactive dicarbonyl metabolite generated under hyperglycaemic conditions. MGO plays a role in developing pathophysiological conditions, including diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms involved and the molecular targets of MGO in the heart have not been elucidated. In this work, we studied the exposure-related effects of MGO on cardiac function in an isolated perfused rat heart ex vivo model. The effect of MGO on calcium homeostasis in cardiomyocytes was studied in vitro by the fluorescence indicator of intracellular calcium Fluo-4. We demonstrated that MGO induced cardiac dysfunction, both in contractility and diastolic function. In rat heart, the effects of MGO treatment were significantly limited by aminoguanidine, a scavenger of MGO, ruthenium red, a general cation channel blocker, and verapamil, an L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker, demonstrating that this dysfunction involved alteration of calcium regulation. MGO induced a significant concentration-dependent increase of intracellular calcium in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, which was limited by aminoguanidine and verapamil. These results suggest that the functionality of various calcium channels is altered by MGO, particularly the L-type calcium channel, thus explaining its cardiac toxicity. Therefore, MGO could participate in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy through its impact on calcium homeostasis in cardiac cells.</description>

      <title>A first-principles geometric model for dynamics of motor-driven centrosomal asters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The centrosomal aster is a mobile cellular organelle that exerts and transmits forces necessary for nuclear migration and spindle positioning. Recent experimental and theoretical studies of nematode and human cells demonstrate that pulling forces on asters by cortical force generators are dominant during such processes. We present a comprehensive investigation of a first-principles model of aster dynamics, the S-model (S for stoichiometry), based solely on such forces. The model evolves the astral centrosome position, a probability field of cell-surface motor occupancy by centrosomal microtubules (under an assumption of stoichiometric binding), and free boundaries of unattached, growing microtubules. We show how cell shape affects the centering stability of the aster, and its transition to oscillations with increasing motor number. Seeking to understand observations in single-cell nematode embryos, we use accurate simulations to examine the nonlinear structures of the bifurcations, and demonstrate the importance of binding domain overlap to interpreting genetic perturbation experiments. We find a rich dynamical landscape, dependent upon cell shape, such as internal equatorial orbits of asters that can be seen as traveling wave solutions. Finally, we study the interactions of multiple asters and demonstrate an effective mutual repulsion due to their competition for cortical force generators. We find, amazingly, that asters can relax onto the vertices of platonic and non-platonic solids, closely mirroring the results of the classical Thomson problem for energy-minimizing configurations of electrons constrained to a sphere and interacting via repulsive Coulomb potentials. Our findings both explain experimental observations, providing insights into the mechanisms governing spindle positioning and cell division dynamics, and show the possibility of new nonlinear phenomena in cell biology.</description>
