      <title>Compounding Effects in Leveraged ETFs: Beyond the Volatility Drag Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common belief is that leveraged ETFs (LETFs) suffer long-term performance decay due to \emph{volatility drag}. We show that this view is incomplete: LETF performance depends fundamentally on return autocorrelation and return dynamics. In markets with independent returns, LETFs exhibit positive expected compounding effects on their target multiples. In serially correlated markets, trends enhance returns, while mean reversion induces underperformance. With a unified framework incorporating AR(1) and AR-GARCH models, continuous-time regime switching, and flexible rebalancing frequencies, we demonstrate that return dynamics -- including return autocorrelation, volatility clustering, and regime persistence -- determine whether LETFs outperform or underperform their targets. Empirically, using about 20 years of SPDR S\&amp;P~500 ETF and Nasdaq-100 ETF data, we confirm these theoretical predictions. Daily-rebalanced LETFs enhance returns in momentum-driven markets, whereas infrequent rebalancing mitigates losses in mean-reverting regimes.</description>

      <title>Financial Data Analysis with Robust Federated Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the analysis of financial data in a federated setting, wherein data is distributed across multiple clients or locations, and the raw data never leaves the local devices. Our primary focus is not only on the development of efficient learning frameworks (for protecting user data privacy) in the field of federated learning but also on the importance of designing models that are easier to interpret. In addition, we care about the robustness of the framework to outliers. To achieve these goals, we propose a robust federated logistic regression-based framework that strives to strike a balance between these goals. To verify the feasibility of our proposed framework, we carefully evaluate its performance not only on independently identically distributed (IID) data but also on non-IID data, especially in scenarios involving outliers. Extensive numerical results collected from multiple public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable performance to those of classical centralized algorithms, such as Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</description>
