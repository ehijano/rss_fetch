      <title>A Census of Variable Radio Sources at $3\,$GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of phenomena, from explosive transients to active galactic nuclei, exhibit variability at radio wavelengths on timescales of a few years. Characterizing the rate and scale of variability in the radio sky can provide keen insights into dynamic processes in the Universe, such as accretion mechanics, jet propagation, and stellar evolution. We use data from the first two epochs of the Very Large Array Sky Survey to conduct a census of the variable radio sky. Approximately $3,600$ objects are found to significantly vary in brightness during the $\sim2.5\,$ years between observations. For compact sources whose mean flux density across the two epochs, $\mu_{S}$, is brighter than $20\,$mJy, $\approx 5\,$% show brightness variations $&gt;30\,$%, rising to $\approx 9\,$% at $\mu_{S}&gt;300\,$mJy. Most of the VLASS variables have multiwavelength properties consistent with blazars and quasars, including those with the largest absolute changes in flux density. The largest fractional changes in brightness are exhibited by galactic sources. We discuss our results, including some of the more interesting and extreme examples of variable radio sources identified, as well as future research directions.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Distant and Metal-Poor Milky Way with SDSS-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) is conducting the first all-sky low-resolution spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way's stellar halo. We describe the stellar parameter pipeline for the SDSS-V halo survey, which simultaneously models spectra, broadband photometry, and parallaxes to derive stellar parameters, metallicities, alpha abundances, and distances. The resulting BOSS-MINESweeper catalog is validated across a wide range of stellar parameters and metallicities using star clusters and a comparison to high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. We demonstrate several scientific capabilities of this dataset: identifying the most chemically peculiar stars in our Galaxy, discovering and mapping distant halo substructures, and measuring the all--sky dynamics of the Milky Way on the largest scales. The BOSS-MINESweeper catalog for SDSS DR19 is publicly available and will be updated for future data releases.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulation of Odd Radio Circles as Merger-Driven Shocks in Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of distinct radio objects that has recently been discovered. The origin of these features is yet unclear because their peculiar properties are a challenge for our current understanding of astrophysical sources for diffuse radio emission. In this work we test the feasibility of major mergers in galaxy groups as a possible formation channel for ORCs. By modeling the assembly of a massive galaxy group with a final virial mass of $M_{200}\sim 10^{13}\, \rm M_\odot$ in a magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulation with on-the-fly cosmic ray treatment, we are able to derive the X-ray and radio properties of the system self-consistently and compare them to observations. We show that the X-ray properties for the simulated system are agreeing with characteristics of observed galaxy groups in the regarded mass range, legitimating the comparison between the radio properties of the simulated halo and those of observed ORCs. A major merger between two galaxies in the simulation is triggering a series of strong shocks in the circumgalactic medium, which in unison are forming a ring if the line of sight is perpendicular to the merger axis. The shock is rapidly expanding in radial direction and quickly reaches the virial radius of the halo. This formation channel can hence readily explain the morphology and large extent of ORCs. However, the inferred radio luminosity of these features is lower than for observed counterparts, while the degree of polarization seems to be systematically overpredicted by the simulation. Fossil cosmic ray populations from AGN and stellar feedback might be necessary to explain the full extent of the radio properties of ORCs, since diffusive shock acceleration was the only source term for non-thermal electrons considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Star formation histories and gas content limits of three ultra-faint dwarfs on the periphery of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of Pegasus V and Pisces VII, along with a re-analysis of the archival imaging of Pegasus W, and Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) neutral gas (HI) observations of all three. These three ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are all within the Local Group in the approximate direction of M31. The VLA observations place stringent upper limits on their HI content, with all having $M_\mathrm{HI} &lt; 10^4\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$. As the red giant branches of these UFDs are sparsely populated, we determined distances from the HST photometry of horizontal branch (HB) stars in comparison to a fiducial HB population (from M92), with all three falling in the range 0.7-1 Mpc. Using a new Python-based star formation history (SFH) fitting code (based on StarFISH), we derive SFHs of all three UFDs. As found previously, the best fit SFH for Pegasus W includes significant star formation well beyond the end of reionization, while the SFHs calculated for Pegasus V and Pisces VII are consistent with them having quenched shortly after reionization. These findings for the latter two objects indicate that, like those in the vicinity of the Milky Way, lower mass UFDs in the vicinity of M31 likely quenched at early times.</description>

      <title>Metal-Poor Star-Forming Clumps in Cosmic Noon Galaxies: Evidence for Gas Inflow and Chemical Dilution Using JWST NIRISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of galaxies are intricately linked to the baryon cycle, which fuels star formation while shaping chemical abundances within galaxies. Investigating the relationship between star formation and metallicity for large samples of galaxies requires expensive IFU surveys or sophisticated tools to analyze grism data. Here we analyze JWST NIRISS slitless grism data using Sleuth, a tool that forward models and infers spatially resolved physical properties from grism data, including observations from JWST NIRISS/NIRCam and future grism data like that from the Roman Space Telescope. Sleuth enables extraction of high-quality emission line maps from slitless spectra, overcoming contamination and spatially varying stellar populations, which previously limited such studies. Utilizing Sleuth with data from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS), we investigated the relationship between metallicity and star formation in the star-forming clumps of galaxies at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.35. We analyzed a sample of 20 galaxies, extracted high-quality emission line maps with Sleuth, and analyzed, in detail, the spatially resolved properties of star-forming clumps. Using $H\alpha$, [SII], and [SIII] emission line maps, we examined the spatially resolved metallicities, ionization, and star formation rates of our sample. Our findings reveal that these star-forming clumps show lower metallicities ($\sim$ 0.1 dex) than their surrounding galactic environments, indicating a metallicity dilution of 20 $\%$ within the clumps' gas. Our analysis indicates that these clumps exhibit intensified star formation and reduced metallicity, likely due to the inflow of metal-poor gas. These clumps illustrate the dynamic relationship between star formation and chemical enrichment within galaxies.</description>

      <title>Challenges to the Two-Infall Scenario by Large Stellar Age Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars in the Milky Way disk exhibit a clear separation into two chemically distinct populations based on their [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. This $\alpha$-bimodality is not a universal feature of simulated disk galaxies and may point to a unique evolutionary history. A popular explanation is the two-infall scenario, which postulates that two periods of substantial accretion rates dominate the assembly history of the Galaxy. Thanks to recent advances in stellar age measurements, we can now compare this model to more direct measurements of the Galaxy's evolutionary timescales across the disk. We run multi-zone galactic chemical evolution models with a two-infall-driven star formation history and compare the results against abundance patterns from APOGEE DR17, supplemented with stellar ages estimated through multiple methods. Although the two-infall scenario offers a natural explanation for the $\alpha$-bimodality, it struggles to explain several features of the age--abundance structure in the disk. First, our models generically predict a massive and long-lasting dilution event, but the data show that stellar metallicity is remarkably constant across much of the lifetime of the disk. This apparent age-independence places considerable restrictions upon the two-infall parameter space. Second, most local metal-rich stars in APOGEE have intermediate ages, yet our models predict these stars should either be very old or very young. Some of these issues can be mitigated, but not completely resolved, by pre-enriching the accreted gas to low metallicity. These restrictions also place limits on the role of merger events in shaping the chemical evolution of the thin disk.</description>

      <title>Disks no more: the morphology of low-mass simulated galaxies in FIREbox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the morphology of hundreds of simulated central galaxies in the stellar mass range $M_\star=10^{7.5} \rm - 10^{11}~$\msun\, from the FIREbox cosmological volume. We demonstrate that FIREbox is able to predict a wide variety of morphologies, spanning from disk-dominated objects to spheroidal galaxies supported by stellar velocity dispersion. However, the simulations predict a strong relation between morphology (degree of rotational support) and stellar mass: galaxies comparable to the Milky Way are often disk-dominated while the presence of stellar disks mostly vanishes for dwarfs with $M_\star &lt;10^9 ~$\msun. This defines a ``morphology transition'' regime for galaxies with $10^9 &lt;M_\star/\rm{M_\odot}&lt; 10^{10}$ in which disks become increasingly common, but below which disks are rare. We show that burstiness in the star formation history and the deepening of the gravitational potential strongly correlate in our simulations with this transition regime, with disks forming in objects with lower levels of burstiness in the last $\sim 6$ Gyr and halos with mass $\sim 10^{11} ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ and above. While observations support a transition towards thicker disks in the regime of dwarfs, our results are in partial disagreement with observations of at least some largely rotationally supported gas disks in dwarfs with $M_\star &lt; 10^9$\msun. This study highlights dwarf morphology as a fundamental benchmark for testing future galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Transient LoBALs at high velocities: A Case of Extreme Broad Absorption Line Variability in J115636.82+085628.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-epoch spectroscopic study of the broad absorption line (BAL) quasar J115636.82+085628.9 (z(em) = 2.1077), based on five spectra spanning nearly two decades in the observer's frame. This source exhibits remarkable variability in both low-ionization (LoBAL: Al III and Mg II) and high-ionization (HiBAL: C IV and Si IV) absorption features. For the first time, we detect the emergence and subsequent disappearance of LoBAL troughs at high velocities (~20,000 kms$^{-1}$), coinciding with the strengthening and weakening of the corresponding HiBAL absorption. The C IV BAL profile extends from ~6,700 kms$^{-1}$ to a conservative upper limit of 30,000 kms$^{-1}$ and is composed of narrow, variable absorption features embedded within a broad, smooth envelope. Both C IV and Si IV BAL troughs exhibit dramatic equivalent width (EW) changes, among the most extreme reported to date. Notably, these EW variations are strongly anti-correlated with continuum flux changes inferred from optical photometric light curves. We interpret this variability as the result of a new absorbing flow transiting into our line of sight, increasing the shielding of a more distant, pre-existing outflow and giving rise to transient LoBAL absorption. This scenario supports a unified picture in which LoBAL and HiBAL features arise from similar outflow structures, with observed differences governed primarily by line-of-sight column densities consistent with previous findings.</description>

      <title>Preliminary census of galaxies in the LISA localisation volume: I. Searching for LISA candidate massive black hole binary merger hosts using Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the launch of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we will be able to estimate the sky position, luminosity distance (d$_{L}$), chirp mass, and mass ratio for detected merging massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. LISA's uncertainties on these estimates will evolve over time, and enable electromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations as early as a month from coalescence. In this paper, we create a framework that takes simulated LISA parameter estimates for sky localisation and d$_{L}$ for a MBHB and performs a census of matching EM galaxies, or candidate host galaxies. We used this framework to investigate these parameter estimates for simulated MBHB systems with masses of $3\times10^{5}$, $3\times10^{6}$, and $1\times10^{7}$M$_{\odot}$ at redshifts of $0.3$ and $0.5$ and used these parameters to select matching galaxies from archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry. We found that the number of candidate host galaxies for a simulated MBHB system at a redshjft of $0.3$ and $1$ hour from coalescence ranged from tens to thousands. After coalescence, we found that our census numbers dropped to zero for all systems when considering median constraints most likely due to survey limitations. For a MBHB with mass $3\times10^{6}$M$_{\odot}$ at $1$ hour from coalescence, increasing the redshift from $0.3$ to $0.5$ or varying the sky position within the SDSS footprint resulted in the number of EM counterparts increasing by approximately a factor of $2$.</description>

      <title>Estimate of Current Mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud from the Orphan-Chenab Tidal Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By fitting the tilt in the path of the Orphan-Chenab Stream (OCS), we conclude that the current mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) within 30 kpc is $4.7$ - $5.1 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We note that the tidal radius of the LMC of this mass is 16.9 kpc, indicating that our measured mass approximates the current bound mass of the LMC. Previous measurements of the LMC mass based on fitting the observed path of the OCS through the Milky Way (MW) halo reported the total mass of the LMC. We show that because the closest approach of the LMC to the OCS, where the gravitational perturbation of the stream path is the highest, is about 20 kpc, the mass of the LMC outside of 30 kpc is not constrained and depends entirely on the assumed radial profile at large radius. Our best-fit total mass varies between $4.5 \times 10^{10}$ and $2.2 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ or more, depending on the presumed radial profile of the LMC. We also show that previous measurements of the mass of the LMC that used a particle-spray method to simulate the path of the OCS suffered from systematic error because they assumed that all particles were stripped from the dwarf galaxy at the tidal radius; N-body simulations show that particles are actually released from a range of distances from the center of mass of the OCS. In contrast, the choice of MW potential has little effect on the estimated LMC mass from the OCS.</description>

      <title>The 2025 Release of Cloudy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the 2025 release of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy, highlighting significant enhancements to the scope and accuracy of the physics which have been made since the previous release. A major part of this development involves resolving the Lyman $\alpha$ line into $j$-resolved fine-structure doublets, making Cloudy of use to the X-ray community. On this front, we have also updated inner-shell ionization line energies and incorporated the 1 keV feature commonly observed in X-ray binaries. Additionally, we update our in-house database, Stout, for the carbon isoelectronic sequence, improving Cloudy microphysical calculations for all wavelengths. We have also extended the molecular network by adding new silicon-bearing species, titanium-related reactions, and phosphorus-containing molecules, enhancing Cloudy's ability to model the complex chemistry relevant to rapidly growing field of exoplanet atmospheres. Finally, we outline future developments aimed at maximizing the scientific return from the current and upcoming generation of observatories, including XRISM, JWST, Roman, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and NewAthena.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Proper Motions of M31 and M33 Using Massive Supergiant Stars with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper motions (PMs) of M31 and M33 are key to understanding the Local Group's dynamical evolution. However, measurement discrepancies between Gaia blue and red samples, regarding whether the transverse velocity is remarkable, introduce significant ambiguity. In this work, we remeasure the systemic PMs of M31 and M33 using massive supergiant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. Clean disk tracers are selected via color-color diagrams, with foreground contaminants removed through kinematic and astrometric cuts. We identify the discrepancy in M31's blue and red samples as arising from systematic differences between Gaia's 5-parameter (5p) and 6-parameter (6p) astrometric solutions. The 6p solution, applied to sources lacking accurate color information, relies on a pseudo-color approximation, leading to lower precision and larger uncertainties. Two key limitations of the 6p solution are: 1) degraded astrometric accuracy for very red sources (GBP - GRP &gt; 2.6); 2) significant PM zero-point offsets. In our sample, red sources are dominated by the 6p solution, while blue sources include a substantial fraction of 5p sources; this mismatch drives the observed discrepancy. By excluding extreme red sources and calibrating PM zero-points separately for 5p and 6p sources using background quasars, we reduce the discrepancy, bringing blue and red measurements into agreement within 1 sigma. We ultimately report the most robust Gaia-based PMs using high-quality 5p sources. For M31, we obtain ({\mu}_{\alpha}*, {\mu}_{\delta})_M31 = (45.9 +/- 8.1, -20.5 +/- 6.6) {\mu}as/yr, consistent with, but more precise than, the HST result. For M33, we find ({\mu}_{\alpha}*, {\mu}_{\delta})_M33 = (45.3 +/- 9.7, 26.3 +/- 7.3) {\mu}as/yr, agreeing with VLBA measurement within 1.5 sigma. These results support a first infall scenario for M33.</description>

      <title>Equation vs. AI: Predict Density and Measure Width of molecular clouds by Multiscale Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar medium widely exists in the universe at multi-scales. In this study, we introduce the {\it Multi-scale Decomposition Reconstruction} method, an equation-based model designed to derive width maps of interstellar medium structures and predict their volume density distribution in the plane of the sky from input column density data. This approach applies the {\it Constrained Diffusion Algorithm}, based on a simple yet common physical picture: as molecular clouds evolve to form stars, the density of interstellar medium increases while their scale decreases. Extensive testing on simulations confirms that this method accurately predicts volume density with minimal error. Notably, the equation-based model performs comparably or even more accurately than the AI-based DDPM model(Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), which relies on numerous parameters and high computational resources. Unlike the "black-box" nature of AI, our equation-based model offers full transparency, making it easier to interpret, debug, and validate. Their simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency make them indispensable not only for understanding complex astrophysical phenomena but also for complementing and enhancing AI-based methods.</description>

      <title>A Nitrogen-rich AGN Powering a Large Ionizing Bubble at z=8.63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of Ly${\alpha}$ in CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, a recently discovered AGN at z = 8.63 by Tripodi et al. (2024), in new NIRSpec/MSA G140H/F070LP observations. We detect broad Ly${\alpha}$ emission (FWHM $= 1540 \pm 260$ km/s) near the systemic velocity, which suggests a large ionizing bubble considering that the universe is almost fully neutral at the redshift. Through Ly${\alpha}$ line-shape modeling assuming a Stromgren sphere, we find a large bubble radius, $R_b = 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ pMpc, and a moderately high Ly${\alpha}$ escape fraction, $f_{esc} = 11 \pm 3$ %. The intrinsic line width is inferred to be broad ($2200 \pm 280$ km/s), likely originating in the broad-line region. Existing data indicate that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is within a mild overdensity, $\delta = 1.9^{+2.9}_{-0.7}$, suggesting that other galaxies in its proximity might have contributed to the formation of the bubble. The high N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / C IV${\lambda}$1548 and N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / O III]${\lambda}$1661 line ratios measured in existing NIRSpec/PRISM data indicate nitrogen enrichment in this metal-poor, low-luminosity AGN. The spectroscopic features are overall similar to other nitrogen-rich galaxies discovered in the literature, such as GN-z11 and GHZ2/GLASSz12. This suggests that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 may represent one of the evolutionary phases of those nitrogen-rich galaxies.</description>

      <title>HI asymmetries of galaxies in the Ursa Major and Perseus-Pisces environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology and kinematics of atomic Hydrogen (HI) gas in galaxies are influenced by both local and large scale cosmic environments. Differences in galaxy environment and interactions can leave distinct signatures in HI asymmetry, offering insight into environmental effects on galaxy evolution. We investigate the role of environment on HI asymmetries in galaxies located in two contrasting structures: the Ursa Major (UMa) group and the Perseus Pisces (PP) filament. We analyze HI 21cm imaging from the WSRT and the VLA, homogenized in resolution for fair comparison. Asymmetries in global profiles and column density maps are measured using criteria established in arXiv:2205.00675 and compared to those of mock galaxies presented in the same study. The PP volume hosts a higher fraction of galaxies with asymmetric global HI profiles (33%) compared to UMa (9%). Likewise, 46% of PP galaxies have morphological HI asymmetries above 0.5 at a threshold of 15 x 10^19 cm^-2, compared to 13% in UMa. The greater column density sensitivity of the UMa data enables detection of lopsided features and asymmetry measurement down to 5 x 10^19 cm^-2. We also identify simulated galaxies with unphysical asymmetries likely caused by unrealistic feedback. In both volumes, stellar and HI morphological asymmetries are uncorrelated. Global profile and morphological asymmetries are also found to be uncorrelated, consistent with previous results.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in the LMC velocity maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of precise Gaia DR3 astrometry in the LMC region has revealed asymmetric patterns in the bar quadrupole and the disc outskirts of the LMC in-plane velocity maps. We aim to quantify the asymmetries detected in the LMC radial and residual tangential velocity maps, and determine whether they are generated naturally due to the LMC's interaction with the SMC. We analyse the velocity maps of different simulations from the KRATOS suite of N-body simulations of the LMC-SMC-MW system, proposing a new methodology to quantify the kinematic asymmetry in the bar and the outskirts of the disc. We also transform the KRATOS simulations into Gaia mock catalogues to confirm that the asymmetric signature in the LMC is not an effect of observational uncertainties. In addition, we investigate the possibility of a classification bias in the neural network classifier of the Gaia optimal sample. In the KRATOS simulations of the LMC and SMC interaction, the dynamical effect of the SMC passages produces a displacement of the bar and asymmetries in the LMC velocity maps. By comparing the velocity maps of mock catalogues of the future Gaia data releases DR4, DR5 and GaiaNIR, we find that the asymmetric signature in the bar quadrupole is independent of observational errors. We thereby confirm that it is a consequence of the interaction of the LMC with the SMC. We also find a classification bias in the neural network classifier, indicating that the outer disc asymmetry observed in the optimal sample is artificial. The analysis of the KRATOS simulations reveals that the interaction of the LMC with the SMC can generate asymmetric patterns in the velocity field. In the case of the Gaia DR3 LMC velocity maps we conclude that the bar quadrupole asymmetry is directly correlated with the SMC interaction, while the outer disc asymmetry is an artefact of the classifier for the optimal sample.</description>

      <title>Deciphering The Launching of Multi-phase AGN-driven Outflows and Their (Spatially Resolved) Multi-scale Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond deepening our understanding of the formation, growth, and evolution of supermassive black holes, it is crucial to uncover the role of feeding and feedback processes from growing black holes (i.e., active galactic nucleus; AGN) in shaping the cosmic ecosystem. Such studies include understanding the dynamics of gas flows in the interstellar (ISM), circumgalactic (CGM), intracluster (ICM), and intergalactic media (IGM). As the output of a sub-group in Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) AGN Working Group, this Science Case Development Document (SCDD) proposes to use future HWO observations to solve the following questions. Which mechanism is dominant in triggering inflows/outflows through feedback? How is AGN activity triggered, and is it associated with circumnuclear star formation and what is the overall effect of AGN feedback on star formation (SF)? In AGN feedback, which mode is more influential and does AGN feedback operate similarly or differently in the local universe and at high redshift? To answer these questions, this SCDD proposes to use potential HWO observations as follows. Resolve and characterize the spatial distribution of ionized and cold/warm molecular gas, especially those in inflows/outflows; Explore the spatial coupling and potential stratification of multi-phase inflows/outflows on different physical scales and their resolved and global correlations with AGN and/or SF activities; Investigate whether corresponding outflows/jets induce shocks and/or fluctuations that trigger or suppress the formation of molecular clouds and hence new stars. Specifically, HWO's capabilities will enable us to achieve the above scientific goals while existing facilities lack the required combination of high-throughput ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) integral field unit (IFU) capabilities with simultaneously sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Diagnostics for the Physical Conditions in Active Galactic Nuclei under the View of JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With excellent spectral and angular resolutions and, especially, sensitivity, the JWST allows us to observe infrared emission lines that were previously inaccessible or barely accessible. These emission lines are promising for evaluating the physical conditions in different galaxies. Based on {\sc MAPPINGS V} photoionization models, we systematically analyze the dependence of over 20 mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission lines covered by the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST on the physical conditions of different galactic environments, in particular narrow line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that mid-IR emission lines of highly ionized argon (i.e., [Ar~{\small V}]7.90,13.10) and neon (i.e., [Ne~{\small V}]14.32,24.32, [Ne~{\small VI}]7.65) are effective in diagnosing the physical conditions in AGN. We accordingly propose new prescriptions to constrain the ionization parameter ($U$), peak energy of the AGN spectrum ($E_{\rm peak}$), metallicity ($\rm 12+log (O/H)$), and gas pressure ($P/k$) in AGN. These new calibrations are applied to the central regions of six Seyfert galaxies included in the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) as a proof of concept. We also discuss the similarity and difference in the calibrations of these diagnostics in AGN of different luminosities, highlighting the impact of hard X-ray emission and particularly radiative shocks, as well as the different diagnostics in star-forming regions. Finally, we propose diagnostic diagrams involving [Ar~{\small V}]7.90 and [Ne~{\small VI}]7.65 to demonstrate the feasibility of using the results of this study to distinguish galactic regions governed by different excitation sources.</description>

      <title>Identifying Radio Active Galactic Nuclei with Machine Learning and Large-Area Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star forming galaxies (SFGs) are the primary sources of extragalactic radio sky. But it is difficult to distinguish the radio emission produced by AGNs from that by SFGs, especially when the radio sources are faint. Best et al. (2023) classified the radio sources in LoTSS Deep Fields DR1 through multiwavelength SED fitting. With the classification results of them, we perform a supervised machine learning to distinguish radio AGNs and radio SFGs.
  Aims. We aim to provide a supervised classifier to identify radio AGNs, which can get both high purity and completeness simultaneously, and can easily be applied to datasets of large-area surveys.
  Methods. The classifications of Best et al. (2023) are used as the true labels for supervised machine learning. With the cross-matched sample of LoTSS Deep Fields DR1, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, the features of optical and mid-infrared magnitude and colors, are applied to train the classifier. The performance of the classifier is evaluated mainly by the precission, recall and F1 score of both AGNs and non-AGNs.
  Results. By comparing the performance of six learning algorithms, CatBoost is chosen to construct the best classifier. The best classifier get precision = 0.974, recall = 0.865 and F1 = 0.916 for AGNs, precision = 0.936, recall = 0.988 and F1 = 0.961 for non-AGNs. After applying our classifier to the cross-matched sample of LoTSS DR2, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, we obtain a sample of 49716 AGNs and 102261 non-AGNs. The reliability of these classification results is confirmed by comparing with the spectroscopic classification of SDSS. The precission and recall of AGN sample can be as high as 94.2% and 92.3%, respectively. We also train a model to identify radio excess sources. The F1 scores are 0.610 and 0.965 for sources with and without radio excess, respectively.</description>

      <title>The role of the pre-exponential factor on temperature programmed desorption spectra: A computational study of frozen species on interstellar icy grain mantles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) is a well-known technique to study gas-surface processes, and it is characterized by two main quantities: the adsorbate binding energy and the pre-exponential factor. While the former has been well addressed in recent years by both experimental and computational methods, the latter remains somewhat ill-defined, and different schemes have been proposed in the literature for its evaluation. In the astrochemistry context, binding energies and pre-exponential factors are key parameters that enter microkinetic models for studying the evolution over time of the chemical species in the universe. In this paper, we studied, by computer simulations, the effect of different pre-exponential factor models using water, ammonia, and methanol adsorbed on amorphous and crystalline ices as test cases: specifically, the one most widely used by the astrochemical community (Herbst-Hasegawa), the models provided by Tait and Campbell, and an extension of the Tait formulation including the calculation of the vibrational partition function. We suggest the methods proposed by Tait and Campbell that provide TPD temperature peaks within 30 K of each other while avoiding demanding quantum mechanical calculations, as they are based on tabulated data. Finally, when the explicit inclusion of the vibrational partition function is needed, we propose a cost-effective strategy to include all the thermal contributions in the partition functions without the need for performing a full vibrational calculation of the whole system.</description>

      <title>STRRINGS: STReams in Residual Images of Nearby GalaxieS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal features from galaxy mergers, particularly stellar streams, offer valuable insights into galaxy assembly and dark matter halo properties. This paper aims to identify a large sample of nearby stellar streams suitable for detailed modelling and comparison with simulations to enable population-level constraints on halo properties. We visually inspect and compile a tidal feature catalogue for $19,387$ galaxies with redshift $z \leq 0.02$ from the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 using original, model, and residual images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Residual images, produced by subtracting models of all sources, enhance the detectability of faint asymmetries such as tidal features. We find that $11.9 \pm 0.2\%$ of galaxies host tidal features, more frequently around early-type than late-type galaxies. The tidal feature fraction increases with stellar mass, from $2.4 \pm 0.4\%$ at $\sim10^8$M$_\odot$ to $36.5 \pm 1.2\%$ at $\sim 5\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$. From this, we present the first release of STRRINGS: STReams in Residual Images of Nearby GalaxieS, a subsample of 35 galaxies with long, narrow streams suitable for modelling. We segment these streams and derive their geometry, surface brightness, colours, and stellar masses. The median $g$-band surface brightness is 26.8 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$, reaching 27.5 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$ for the faintest stream. Mass ratios are consistent with minor mergers, and we identify five potential dwarf galaxy progenitors. Our streams are typically longer (median 124 kpc) than the literature, with comparable widths. Stream mass correlates with length and colour, and wider streams lie at larger galactocentric radii. STRRINGS will be expanded and used to constrain halo properties in future work.</description>

      <title>The ALMA REBELS survey: [OIII]$_{88\mu \text{m}}$ line scans of UV-bright $z \gtrsim 7.6$ galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the [OIII]$_{88\mu \text{m}}$ spectral scan results from the ALMA Large Program REBELS (Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey). The generally high luminosity of [OIII]$_{88\mu \text{m}}$ and ALMA's Band 7 efficiency motivated its use for line scans of REBELS targets at $z&gt;8$. Spectral scans of four sources covered 326.4-373.0 GHz ($z=8.10$-9.39), reaching [OIII]$_{88\mu \text{m}}$ luminosities of $\mathrm{\sim7.6\times10^8\ L_{\odot}}$ ($5\sigma$) for a FWHM of 400 km s$^{-1}$. No credible lines are detected for the four targets. For REBELS-04, the non-detection is unexpected given the $\geq92\%$ coverage of the redshift likelihood distribution and its estimated SFR of 40 $\text{M}_{\odot}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$. Possible explanations for the faint [OIII]$_{88\mu \text{m}}$ emission (assuming a FWHM of 100 km s$^{-1}$) include high ISM densities ($&gt;n_{\text{crit}} \approx 510\ \text{cm}^{-3}$) and low ionization parameters ($\mathrm{log_{10}\ U_{ion}\lesssim -2.5}$). For REBELS-37, a subsequent detection of [CII]$_{158\mu \text{m}}$ ($z=7.643$) confirmed it lay outside our scan range. For REBELS-11 and REBELS-13, it remains unclear if the non-detection is due to the depth of the line scan or redshift coverage. REBELS-04 and REBELS-37 show significant ($\geq3.8\sigma$) dust continuum emission in Band 7. If the photometric redshift of REBELS-04 is accurate, i.e., $z_{\mathrm{phot}}=8.57^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ or $z_{\mathrm{phot}}=8.43^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$ accounting for additional neutral hydrogen in the circumgalactic medium, REBELS-04 would constitute the most distant dust-detected galaxy identified with ALMA to date. Additional Band 6 dust observations of REBELS-37 constrain the shape of the far-IR SED, ruling out cold dust temperatures ($\lesssim28$ K) at $3\sigma$. Further insight into these galaxies will require spectroscopic redshifts and deeper multi-band dust observations.</description>

      <title>Testing Dark Matter with Generative Models for Extragalactic Stellar Streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming ground and space-based surveys are poised to illuminate low surface brightness tidal features, providing a new observable connection to dark matter physics. From imaging of tidal debris, the morphology of stellar streams can be used to infer the geometry of dark matter halos. In this paper, we develop a generative approach, X-Stream, which translates stream imaging into constraints on the radial density profile of dark matter halos--from the inner region out to the virial radius. Using the GPU-accelerated code streamsculptor, we generate thousands of stream realizations in trial gravitational potentials and apply nested sampling with a custom objective function to explore viable regions of parameter space. We find that multiple stellar streams can be used to constrain the entire radial density profile of a halo, including both its inner and outer density slopes. These constraints provide a test for alternatives to cold dark matter, such as self-interacting dark matter, which predicts cored density profiles. From cosmological simulations, the outer density slope is expected to correlate with merger histories though remains underexplored observationally. With ongoing and upcoming missions such as Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, ARRAKIHS, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, X-Stream will enable detailed mapping of dark matter for thousands of galaxies across a wide range of redshifts and halo masses.</description>

      <title>Revisiting symbiotic binaries with interferometry: II. New PIONIER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars, which generally comprise a red giant and an accreting white dwarf, are excellent laboratories to understand mass transfer in wide binaries, with application to a wide family of systems. One of the fundamental questions is how mass is transferred from the red giant to the white dwarf. We use interferometric measurements made with the VLTI/PIONIER instrument, combined with Gaia data, to measure the radius of the giant in seven symbiotic systems. We further place the giants in the H-R diagramme, which allows us to estimate their mass and to show that they are all very evolved and likely on the asymptotic giant branch. We compare our measured giant radii to their Roche-lobe radius and show that, except for ZZ CMi, all giants are well within their Roche lobe and that mass transfer likely takes place via stellar wind. Our interferometric data provide further evidence that the giant in ZZ CMi (nearly) fills its Roche lobe. Our conclusions are still hampered by the poor characterisation of some of the giants or their binary orbit, and we encourage the community to make an effort to provide these.</description>

      <title>Revealing a ribbon-like jet in OJ 287 with RadioAstron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present space-based very long baseline interferometry observations of the BL Lac type object OJ 287 taken with RadioAstron at 22 GHz on April 25, 2016, in conjunction with a ground array comprising 27 radio telescopes. We detect ground-space fringes at projected baselines extending up to 4.6 Earth diameters, which allowed us to image the jet in OJ 287 with an angular resolution of ~47 {\mu}as. Applying an advanced regularized maximum likelihood imaging method, we resolved the innermost jet structure with a complex morphology at a resolution of ~15 {\mu}as (~0.1 pc projected distance). For the first time, due to a favorable geometrical position of the jet in tandem with high data quality, we detect multiple sharp bends that form a "ribbon-like" jet structure that extends down to 1 mas. Two-dimensional Gaussian model-fitting reveals regions of the jet with brightness temperatures of more than 10^13 K, indicative of strong Doppler boosting. Polarimetric imaging reveals that the electric vector position angles are predominantly perpendicular to the innermost jet direction, implying a dominant poloidal magnetic field component near the central engine. Complementary multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array observations at 43 GHz provide a multifrequency view of the jet evolution. Ridgeline analysis of the 43 GHz data shows significant variations in the jet position angle from 2014 to 2017, behavior consistent with a rotating helical jet structure. Finally, we confirm the emergence of a new jet component (B15 or K), which may be associated with the source's first TeV flare, and offer new observational constraints relevant to models involving a supermassive black hole binary.</description>

      <title>SPAN: A cross-platform Python GUI software for optical and near-infrared spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of high-quality optical and near-infrared spectroscopic data, as well as advances in modelling techniques, have greatly expanded the scientific potential of spectroscopic studies. However, the software tools needed to fully exploit this potential often remain fragmented across multiple specialised packages, requiring scripting skills and manual integration to handle complex workflows. In this paper we present SPAN (SPectral ANalysis), a cross-platform, Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) software that unifies the essential tools for modern spectral analysis within a single, user-friendly environment. While SPAN can be used with a variety of spectroscopic targets, its primary focus is the analysis of unresolved galaxy spectra. SPAN allows users to extract 1D spectra from FITS images and datacubes, perform spectral processing (e.g. Doppler correction, continuum modelling, denoising), and carry out detailed analyses, including line-strength measurements, stellar and gas kinematics, and stellar population studies, using both built-in routines and the widely adopted pPXF algorithm for full spectral fitting. It runs natively on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, and is fully task-driven, requiring no prior coding experience. We validate SPAN by comparing its output with existing pipelines and literature studies. By offering a flexible, accessible, and well integrated environment, SPAN simplifies and accelerates the spectral analysis workflow, while maintaining scientific accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the origin of a possible hard VHE spectrum from M87 discovered by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent LHAASO observations hint at potential spectral hardening around 20 TeV in M87's very high energy (VHE) emission, suggesting a possible new radiation component. In this work, we construct averaged multiwavelength SEDs by combining data from Chandra and Swift-UVOT/XRT covering the same period as the LHAASO detection to investigate the origin of this feature. We test several radiation mechanisms, including the pp interaction, proton synchrotron emission, photomeson process and two-zone leptonic model. We find that only the pion decay gamma rays in pp interactions can interpret this feature in the framework of the one-zone model. With analytical analysis, we prove that proton synchrotron emission cannot generate a hard spectrum above 0.17~TeV. For photomeson model, it requires an emission zone compressed near the Schwarzschild radius of the central supermassive black hole, incompatible with broadband optical-GeV spectral constraints. In addition, the two-zone leptonic model also emerges as a viable alternative.</description>

      <title>PARSEC V2.0: Rotating tracks and isochrones for seven addtional metallicities in the range Z=0.0001-0.03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PARSEC v2.0 rotating stellar tracks were previously presented for six values of metallicity from subsolar to solar values, with initial rotation rates ($\omega_\mathrm{i}$, defined as the ratio of angular velocity and its critical value) spanning from the non-rotating case to very near the critical velocity (i.e. $\omega_\mathrm{i}=0.99$), and for initial masses covering the $\sim 0.7 M_\odot$ to $14 M_\odot$ interval. Furthermore, we provided the corresponding isochrones converted into several photometric systems, for different inclination angles between the line-of-sight and the rotation axes, from $0^\circ$ (pole-on) to $90^\circ$ (equator-on). In this work, we expand this database with seven other sets of metallicity, including five sets of low metallicity ($Z=0.0001-0.002$) and two sets of super-solar values (up to $Z=0.03$). Here, we present the new stellar tracks, comprising $\sim$3\,040 tracks in total ($\sim$5\,500 including previous sets), along with the new corresponding rotating isochrones. We also introduce the possibility of creating isochrones, by interpolation, for values of rotating rates not available in the initial set of tracks. We compare a selection of our new models with rotating stellar tracks from the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code, and we assess the quality of our new tracks by fitting the colour-magnitude diagram of the open cluster NGC6067. We take advantage of the projected rotational velocity of member stars measured by Gaia to validate our results and examine the surface oxygen abundances in comparison with the observed data. All newly computed stellar tracks and isochrones are retrievable via our dedicated web databases and interfaces.</description>

      <title>Pre-discovery TESS Observations of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. We report serendipitous Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations of 3I/ATLAS taken between 2025-05-07 and 2025-06-02,, 55 days prior to the discovery date (2025-07-01) and 14 days prior to the current earliest observation (2025-05-21). We retrieve the TESS pixel data, perform a robust background correction and use a data-driven approach to refine the object's ephemeris. We find a statistically significant offset between the target's observed and predicted positions and we show that this is dominated by uncertainty in the TESS World Coordinate System (WCS) rather than the ephemeris. 3I/ATLAS is too faint to be detected in the individual 200\,second TESS integrations, so we perform image stacking to improve detectability. After co-adding the TESS image data, we performed aperture and Pixel Response Function (PRF) photometry to create two light curves for 3I/ATLAS. Each light curve consists of 15 measurements with $\text{SNR}&gt;3$, collected across two different TESS cameras during the 26\,days that the object was observed, but the PRF light curve is more robust against image noise. The PRF light curve in the TESS bandpass shows a gradual increase in brightness from $T_{\text{mag}} = 20.9 \pm 0.29$ to $T_{\text{mag}} = 19.57 \pm 0.15$. This is expected as 3I/ATLAS approaches the inner Solar System. This paper highlights the power of using TESS for Solar System science; by increasing the photometric observing baseline, future studies will be able to investigate the long-term behavior of 3I/ATLAS</description>

      <title>MINDS. Young binary systems with JWST/MIRI: Variable water-rich primaries and extended emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the JWST GTO program MINDS, we analyze the mid-infrared emission of three Class II binary systems: VW Cha, WX Cha, and RW Aur, to investigate the impact of stellar multiplicity on the chemistry and physics of their inner disk. We analyze the 1D spectrum from JWST/MIRI-MRS for primary and secondary disks separately, extracted by combining forward modeling with a theoretical PSF and aperture photometry. We modeled the molecular lines with 0D slab models. We interpret the results by comparing our JWST spectra to VLT/CRIRES+, Spitzer/IRS, and ALMA. Primary and secondary disks are dramatically different in their mid-infrared emission, with primary disks showing H2O-rich spectra, and secondary disks being mostly line poor to the sensitivity of our spectra. When comparing MIRI-MRS to Spitzer/IRS, we observe large variability in the line emission of VW Cha A, as well as in the continuum of RW Aur A. The disks around VW Cha BC and RW Aur B show evidence of ionizing radiation, and a further comparison with ALMA at high angular resolution dust continuum suggest that the spectrum of RW Aur B is well explained by its ~4 au cavity. All the systems show [Ne II] jet emission, and three of them also show spatially resolved emission structures in H2, likely originated by outflows and dynamical interactions. Many of the observed features in the primary disks, such as enhanced water emission, could be linked to the increased accretion and radial drift produced by dynamical disk truncation. However, additional mechanisms are needed to explain the large differences between primary and secondary disks, potentially inner disk substructures. This work is an example of the need for combining multiple facilities to fully understand the observations from JWST.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Confirmation: Fast rotators in the young clusters NGC 1856 and NGC 1953</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a spectroscopic investigation of two Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters, NGC 1953 and NGC 1856. Both clusters have similar ages (250 and 300 Myr, respectively). Spectra were recorded with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5m telescope. Spectra were visually inspected to assess the presence of stellar H$\alpha$ emission lines attributed to B stars rotating close to breakup velocity (Be stars). High fractions of Be stars in the cluster typically indicate the presence of a large population of fast rotating stars, predicted by some models to explain the observed split and extended main sequence. There are numerous Be star candidates in NGC 1856, exhibiting weak but broad H$\alpha$ emission. However, only one such target was detected in NGC 1953. This stark contrast between the observed populations for NGC 1856 and NGC 1953 may suggest that cluster density plays a key role in determining the fraction of Be stars. These results provide essential constraints for the different scenarios attempting to explain the bimodal distribution of rotational velocities and the multiple populations of stars observed in globular clusters. The impact of stellar radial velocity and nebular emission on photometric measures is assessed through simulations relying on the spectra. These simulations suggest that photometric studies can under-estimate the fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters in a cluster, in particular for stars with relatively weak emission features. The results also show that nebular emission has minimal impact on the photometric H$\alpha$ excesses.</description>

      <title>How Early Could the Milky Way's Disk Form?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate early, $z &gt; 3$, galaxy formation in a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a close, early-forming Milky Way (MW) analog extracted from TNG50 simulation and resimulated with detailed modeling of cold interstellar medium (ISM) formation, coupled with on-the-fly UV radiative transfer, turbulence-regulated star formation, and stellar feedback. In our enhanced-physics simulation, the galaxy develops a bistable ISM structure (warm, with $T \sim 10^4$ K, and cold, with $T &lt; 100$ K) and exhibits significantly more efficient, early, and bursty star formation than in TNG. Notably, the stellar disk of this MW progenitor forms extremely early, around $z\sim6-7$, and exhibits chemo-kinematic properties consistent with the low-metallicity population of the MW stars. The disk forms rapidly, on a timescale of $\sim$0.2 Gyr which is significantly shorter than the timescale implied by the observable chemo-kinematic signatures of disk spinup, $\sim$0.7 Gyr, due to the scatter in the age--metallicity relation. The rotational support of the gas disk and the location of the galaxy on the main sequence are consistent with early disk galaxies observed by JWST and ALMA at $z\sim4-7$, suggesting that some of these galaxies could be progenitors of MW-like systems. Remarkably, the variation of the global star formation rate (SFR) before disk formation is similar to the observed SFR scatter at these early times. Our findings underscore the critical role of modeling a turbulent cold ISM and turbulence-regulated star formation and feedback in driving early SFR variability, while at the same time enabling early disk formation, without destroying it with overly efficient stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>From UV-bright Galaxies to Early Disks: the Importance of Turbulent Star Formation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bursty star formation at early times can explain the surprising abundance of early UV-bright galaxies revealed by JWST but can also be a reason for the delayed formation of galactic disks in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We investigate this interplay in a cosmological simulation of an early-forming Milky Way analog with detailed modeling of the cold turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), star formation, and feedback. We find that the modeling of locally variable star formation efficiency (SFE) coupled with the ISM turbulence on the scales of star-forming regions is important for producing both early bursty evolution and early formation and survival of galactic disks. Such a model introduces a qualitatively new channel of the global star formation rate (SFR) burstiness caused by chaotic fluctuations in the average SFE due to changes in the ISM turbulence, which, in our simulation, dominates the short-term SFR variability. The average SFE stays low, close to $\sim 1\%$ per freefall time, and its variation decreases when the gas disk forms, leading to only mild effects of stellar feedback on the early disk, enabling its survival. By rerunning our simulation with fixed SFE values, we explicitly show that low SFEs lead to smoother SFR histories and disk survival, while high SFEs lead to bursty SFRs and hinder disk formation. The model with variable SFE switches between these two regimes at the moment of disk formation. These trends are missing in more commonly used star formation prescriptions with fixed SFE; in particular, the prescriptions tying star formation to molecular gas should be interpreted with caution because the two are decoupled at early times, as we also show in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We explore the effect of local stellar radiation on the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies around Milky Way (MW) analogues. Using five simulations from the Auriga project, both with and without local stellar radiation, we find that local stellar radiation, as a pre-reionization source, is highly effective at photoionizing and heating the gas around the proto-MW analogues. As a result, the formation of surrounding dwarf galaxies in dark matter halos with masses below approximately $10^{9.5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are significantly suppressed. After reionization, the intensity of local stellar radiation eventually becomes comparable to the ultraviolet background (UVB). Consequently, the impact of local stellar radiation on the surrounding dwarf galaxy formation decreases with decreasing redshift and nearly vanishes after redshift $z=4$. At present day, the bright satellite population in the simulations with and without local stellar radiation is nearly identical. While our simulations do not have sufficient resolution to resolve the faintest satellite galaxies which are most prone to the local stellar radiation, we use the accreted galaxy mass function to assess the impact and find that the reduction in the faintest satellite is around $13$ percent in the presence of local stellar radiation, but this difference is within $\sim2\sigma$ of the Poisson uncertainty and thus not statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Correlation between Outlying Halo Abundance and Host Halo Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlations between dark matter halo properties and subhalo abundance, or occupation, have been studied extensively; however, existing studies have mainly focused on subhalos within the virial radius of the host halo. In this work, we quantify the correlation between host halo properties and the abundance of neighboring halos that reside right outside of the virial radius of the host halos. We compute the correlations between four host halo properties (half-mass scale, concentration, peak-mass scale, and spin) and the outlying halo occupation out to 1.5 Mpc for Milky Way-mass host halos, and study how the correlation strength varies with radius. We also investigate if the outlying halo occupation can provide information about the host halo properties. We find that host halo properties impact the neighboring halo abundance beyond the virial radius, and the locations at which the correlation peaks do not typically align with the virial radius or splashback radius. The behavior of this observed correlation as a function of radius, especially in the outskirts, is connected to the effect of halo assembly bias. However, there is no universal behavior when considering different host halo properties. Our results are the first to quantify the occupation variation of outlying halos beyond the virial radius. They provide the theoretical background for interpreting the observed satellite systems when the observed satellites are not strictly defined to be within the virial radius.</description>

      <title>The Warm-Hot Disk-Halo Interface Below the Perseus Spiral Arm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way's disk-halo interface mediates energy and mass exchange between the interstellar thin disk and the halo. In the first detailed study of the Perseus arm's disk-halo interface, we combine HST/STIS and COS absorption spectra toward 6 stars and 23 AGNs projected behind a narrow section ($95\degree&lt;l&lt;145\degree$, $-46\degree&lt;b&lt;0\degree$), providing a unique dataset that bridges the disk and its extended vertical structure in these directions. We measure \SII, \SiIV, and \CIV\ absorption, along with \HI\ 21 cm emission, at heights $-70$ pc to $-3.3$ kpc from the mid-plane. The arm's southern vertical structure shows distinct height-dependent behaviors: \HI\ and \SII\ column densities sharply decline with height up to 1.5 kpc, then continue declining at a much shallower rate at greater heights. In contrast, high ion (Si IV and C IV) column densities remain relatively constant throughout the entire height range. In the disk-halo interface, where warm neutral medium dominates, \SII\ and the high ions show similar kinematics, and we find a remarkably uniform \CIV/\SiIV\ ratio (\cIVsiIVav$\,=2.5 \pm 0.5$) within $-0.9$ to $-3.25$ kpc. Both the kinematic correspondence and high-ion ratio are consistent with the high ions probing turbulent mixing layers at the interfaces between warm/cool and hot gas phases. The AGN sightlines reveal minimal circumgalactic medium (CGM) contribution in the low-velocity gas at $|v_{\rm LSR}|&lt; 100$ \kms. The extraplanar absorbing gas may trace material ejected from previous Galactic fountain activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many spiral galaxies host magnetic fields with energy densities comparable to those of the turbulent and thermal motions of their interstellar gas. However, quantitative comparison between magnetic field properties inferred from observation and those obtained from theoretical modeling has been lacking. In Paper I we developed a simple, axisymmetric galactic dynamo model that uses various observational data as input. Here we apply our model to calculate radial profiles of azimuthally and vertically averaged magnetic field strength and pitch angle, gas velocity dispersion and scale height, turbulent correlation time and length, and the sizes of supernova remnants for the galaxies M31, M33, M51, and NGC 6946, using input data collected from the literature. Scaling factors are introduced to account for a lack of precision in both theory and observation. Despite the simplicity of our model, its outputs agree fairly well with galaxy properties inferred from observation. Additionally, we find that most of the parameter values are similar between galaxies. We extend the model to predict the magnetic field pitch angles arising from a combination of mean-field dynamo action and the winding up of the random small-scale field owing to the large-scale radial shear. We find their magnitudes to be much smaller than those of the pitch angles measured in polarized radio and far infrared emission. This suggests that effects not included in our model, such as effects associated with spiral arms, are needed to explain the pitch angle values.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in the Eos Cloud: dynamically important fields in the interface between atomic and molecular gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently-discovered Eos molecular cloud, is a CO-dark, low-density cloud located at a distance of approximately 94 pc from the Sun which does not appear to have formed stars at any point in its history. In this paper we investigate the magnetic fields in the Eos cloud, near the interface between the atomic Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and molecular gas, using dust emission and extinction polarimetry. A Histogram of Relative Orientation analysis shows that the magnetic field is preferentially parallel to the density structure of the cloud, while a Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi analysis finds magnetic field strengths of 6$\pm$3 $\mu$G across the Eos cloud and 12$\pm$4 $\mu$G in the somewhat denser MBM 40 sub-region. These results are consistent with a previous estimate of magnetic field strength in the Local Bubble and suggest that the fields in the Eos cloud are dynamically important compared to both gravity and turbulence. Our findings are fully consistent with the expected behavior of magnetized, non-self-gravitating gas near the CNM/molecular cloud boundary.</description>

      <title>Quasar lifetime measurements from extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z\sim 6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars within the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our understanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further exacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim 10^6$ years, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed in the quasars' rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based on the extents of the proximity zones may be underestimated, as time-variable obscuration effects might have limited the quasars' emission along our sightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime measurements for six quasars at $z \sim 6$ leveraging the extended nebular emission perpendicular to our line-of-sight. We use observations from the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to search for extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small proximity zones and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between the SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the independent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption system prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar's proximity zone, which thus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our results provide further evidence that the quasars' current accretion episode has only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of high-redshift galaxies provides critical insights into the early stages of cosmic evolution, particularly during the so-called 'cosmic noon', when star formation activity reached its peak. Within this context, the origin of the nebular emission remains an open question. In this work, we conduct a systematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec data and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive gas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron densities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising photons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar mass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar multiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission. Specifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) &gt; 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100 Msol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can reproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities, models for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300 Msol) and Zstar much lower &lt; Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully account for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce that the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the ionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Analysis of Pictor II: a very low metallicity ultra-faint dwarf galaxy bound to the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Magellan/IMACS and Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy of the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Pictor~II (Pic~II) that is located only 12 kpc from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). From the IMACS spectroscopy, we identify 13 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric velocity of $326.9\pm1.1~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a velocity dispersion of $3.5_{-0.9}^{+1.1}~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a mean metallicity of $\overline{{\rm [Fe/H]}}=-2.99\pm0.06$, and an upper limit on the metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;0.18$. We measure detailed elemental abundances for the brightest star, finding $\mbox{[Fe/H]} = -3.3$, high [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, and no detectable neutron capture elements, similar to stars in other UFDs. However, this star has an unusually high [Sc/Fe] ratio. The dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($M/L=760_{-420}^{+910}~M_{\odot}~L^{-1}_{\odot}$), size, and chemical abundances confirms that Pic~II is a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. We perform detailed orbit modeling of Pic~II in a combined Milky Way (MW) and LMC potential and find that Pic~II is highly likely to be a long-term LMC satellite. Furthermore, we find that Pic II is likely still bound to the LMC today. Pic~II is the seventh LMC-associated UFD and among the most metal-poor UFDs known. We further update the morphological parameters with deeper Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry, compute the dark matter properties for dark matter indirect detection searches, verify the extremely low metallicity with narrowband CaHK imaging, and briefly discuss tidal influences of the LMC and MW.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational potential of the Milky Way encodes information about the distribution of all matter -- including dark matter -- throughout the Galaxy. Gaia data release 3 has revealed a complex structure that necessitates flexible models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We make use of a sample of 5.6 million upper-main-sequence stars to map the full 3D gravitational potential in a one-kiloparsec radius from the Sun using a data-driven approach called ``Deep Potential''. This method makes minimal assumptions about the dynamics of the Galaxy -- that the stars are a collisionless system that is statistically stationary in a rotating frame (with pattern speed to be determined). We model the distribution of stars in 6D phase space using a normalizing flow and the gravitational network using a neural network. We recover a local pattern speed of $\Omega_p = 28.2\pm0.1\mathrm{\,km/s/kpc}$, a local total matter density of $\rho=0.086\pm0.010\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$ and local dark matter density of $\rho_\mathrm{DM}=0.007\pm0.011\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$. The full 3D model exhibits spatial fluctuations, which may stem from the model architecture and non-stationarity in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): A Census of Star Formation and Cold Gas Properties in Massive protoclusters at 1.5&lt;z&lt;4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field at z&gt;2. We further show that, instead of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end. Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_\star$&gt;8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass assembly in forming cluster cores.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Multi-band Galaxy Observations with Large Language Model-Based Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomical research traditionally relies on extensive domain knowledge to interpret observations and narrow down hypotheses. We demonstrate that this process can be emulated using large language model-based agents to accelerate research workflows. We propose mephisto, a multi-agent collaboration framework that mimics human reasoning to interpret multi-band galaxy observations. mephisto interacts with the CIGALE codebase, which includes spectral energy distribution (SED) models to explain observations. In this open-world setting, mephisto learns from its self-play experience, performs tree search, and accumulates knowledge in a dynamically updated base. As a proof of concept, we apply mephisto to the latest data from the James Webb Space Telescope. mephisto attains near-human proficiency in reasoning about galaxies' physical scenarios, even when dealing with a recently discovered population of "Little Red Dot" galaxies. This represents the first demonstration of agentic research in astronomy, advancing towards end-to-end research via LLM agents and potentially expediting astronomical discoveries.</description>

      <title>Investigating the metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rate relation of red supergiants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs) are cool and evolved massive stars exhibiting enhanced mass loss compared to their main sequence phase, affecting their evolution and fate. However, the theory of the wind-driving mechanism is not well-established and the metallicity dependence has not been determined. We aim to uniformly measure the mass-loss rates of large samples of RSGs in different galaxies with $-0.7\lesssim[Z]\lesssim0$ to investigate whether there is a potential correlation with metallicity. We collected photometry from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared for all our RSG candidates to construct their spectral energy distribution (SED). Our final sample includes 893 RSG candidates in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 396 in NGC 6822, 527 in the Milky Way, 1425 in M31, and 1854 in M33. Each SED was modelled using the radiative transfer code DUSTY under the same assumptions to derive the mass-loss rate. The mass-loss rates range from approximately $10^{-9} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to $10^{-5} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average value of $1.5\times10^{-7} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We provided a new mass-loss rate relation as a function of luminosity and effective temperature for both the SMC and Milky Way and compared our mass-loss rates with those derived in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The turning point in the mass-loss rate vs. luminosity relation differs by around 0.2 dex between the LMC and SMC. The mass-loss rates of the Galactic RSGs at $\log(L/L_\odot)&lt;4.5$ were systematically lower than those determined in the other galaxies, possibly due to uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. We found 60-70% of the RSGs to be dusty. The results for M31 and M33 are inconclusive because of source blending at distances above 0.5 Mpc, given the resolution of Spitzer. Overall, we found similar mass-loss rates among the galaxies, indicating no strong correlation with metallicity.</description>

      <title>Constraining the [CII] luminosity function from the power spectrum of line-intensity maps at redshift 3.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forthcoming measurements of the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum (PS) are expected to provide valuable constraints on astrophysical and cosmological quantities. We focus on the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at high redshift, which remains poorly constrained, especially at the faint end. We present forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) that is to be conducted with the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) at $z\simeq3.6$. We also make predictions for surveys with a ten times larger sky coverage and/or a $\sqrt{10}$ times higher sensitivity, accounting for the Lorentzian spectral profile of Fabry-P\'erot interferometers and the impact of their resolving power $R$. Motivated by the halo-occupation properties of [CII] emitters in the MARIGOLD simulations, we derived a luminosity-mass relation by abundance matching two ALPINE LFs to the halo mass function. This relation was then used in a halo-model framework to predict the PS and its uncertainty. Bayesian inference on mock PS data provided forecasts for the first two LF moments and Schechter parameters. Depending on the true LF, the DSS is expected to be able to detect clustering and shot-noise components with signal-to-noise ratios of $\gtrsim2$. At $R=100$, spectral smoothing masks redshift-space distortions, rendering the damping scale $\sigma$ unmeasurable. For $R\gtrsim500$, $\sigma$ is distinguishable from instrumental effects, though degeneracies with amplitude parameters increase. Joint fits to the PS and LF yield precise constraints on the Schechter normalisation and cutoff luminosity, while the faint-end slope remains uncertain (unless the true value approaches $-2$). An increased survey sensitivity offers greater gains than a wider area. A higher spectral resolution improves the access to physical parameters, but intensifies degeneracies. This highlights key design trade-offs in LIM surveys.</description>

      <title>Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* &lt; 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.</description>

      <title>Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pop III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts that a substantial fraction of the early universe was ionized by supermassive stars at redshifts $z\sim20-30$, an era we refer to as ``The Flash''. This is followed by recombination to a mainly neutral state within a few tens of Myr. Here we discuss the implication of this ionization for the scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), $\tau$. We find a fiducial contribution of $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.04$. Combining this with the contribution to reionization by standard galaxy populations at $z\lesssim 10$ with $\tau_{\rm gal}\simeq0.06$, yields a total of $\tau\simeq0.10$. As noted recently by several authors, such a value may help resolve apparent ``problems'' faced by $\Lambda$CDM of discrepant CMB-based measures of the Hubble constant (``Hubble tension''), as well as negative neutrino masses and dynamical dark energy that have been implied by recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In addition, free-free emission from The Flash boosts the cosmic radio background, which could help explain the large 21-cm absorption depth reported by the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES).</description>

      <title>From a Different Star: 3I/ATLAS in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the third interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS (`3I'), provides a rare chance to directly observe a small body from another Solar System. Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential. In this Letter, we present a first assessment of 3I in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford model, which uses data from Gaia in conjunction with models of protoplanetary disk chemistry and Galactic dynamics to predict the properties of the ISO population. The model shows that both the velocity and radiant of 3I are within the expected range. Its velocity predicts an age of over 7.6 Gyr and a high water mass fraction, which may become observable shortly. We also conclude that it is very unlikely that 3I shares an origin with either of the previous two interstellar object detections.</description>

      <title>Intercepting 3I/ATLAS at Closest Approach to Jupiter with the Juno spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to arrive at a distance of $53.56(\pm 0.45)$ million ${\rm km}$ ($0.358\pm 0.003$~au) from Jupiter on March 16, 2026. We show that applying a total thrust $\Delta$V of $2.6755 {{\rm km~s^{-1}}}$ to lower perijove on September 9, 2025 and then execute a Jupiter Oberth Maneuver, can bring the Juno spacecraft from its orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS on March 14, 2026. We further show that it is possible for Juno to come much closer to 3I/ATLAS ($\sim{27}$ million km) with 110 kg of remaining propellant, merely 5.4% of the initial fuel reservoir. We find that for low available $\Delta$V there is no particular benefit in application of a double impulse (for example to reach $\sim{27}$ million km from 3I/ATLAS), however if Juno has a higher $\Delta$V capability there is significant advantage to a second impulse with typically a saving of propellant by a factor of a half. A close fly-by might be able to probe the nature of 3I/ATLAS far better than telescopes on Earth.</description>
