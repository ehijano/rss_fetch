      <title>A Review of Cloud Computing in Seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismology has entered the petabyte era, driven by decades of continuous recordings of broadband networks, the increase in nodal seismic experiments, and the recent emergence of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). This review explains how commercial clouds - AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure - by providing object storage, elastic compute, and managed databases, enable researchers to "bring the code to the data," thereby overcoming traditional HPC solutions' bandwidth and capacity limitations. After literature reviews of cloud concepts and their research applications in seismology, we illustrate the capacities of cloud-native workflows using two canonical end-to-end demonstrations: 1) ambient noise seismology and cross-correlation, and 2) earthquake detection, discrimination, and phase picking. Both workflows utilized S3 for streaming I/O and DocumentDB for provenance, demonstrating that cloud throughput can rival on-premises HPC at comparable costs, scanning 100 TBs to 1.3 PBs of seismic data in a few hours or days of processing. The review also discusses research and education initiatives, the reproducibility benefits of containers, and cost pitfalls (e.g., egress, I/O fees) of energy-intensive seismological research computing. While designing cloud pipelines remains non-trivial, partnerships with research software engineers enable converting domain code into scalable, automated, and environmentally conscious solutions for next-generation seismology.</description>

      <title>Multiscale transform based seismic reflectivity inversion using convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multiscale Fourier Transform of a seismic trace performs time-frequency analyses over a range of window lengths. The variation in window length captures local and global relative amplitudes between events, thereby allowing reflectivity inversion that is independent of the amplitude spectrum of the seismic wavelet. As the temporal and spatial variation of the actual seismic wavelet in seismic reflection data is poorly known, this approach has many advantages over conventional seismic reflectivity inversion. No wavelet extraction is performed. Thus, the inversion for reflectivity can be conducted without well control, seismic ties, or time-depth functions. The inversion is sparse, so no starting model is needed. Furthermore, as no wavelet is required, the inversion can be applied directly to depth migrated data. The phase of the wavelet is constrained by the assumption of sparse reflectivity and thus works best when earth impedance structure is blocky. Trace integration of the inverted reflectivity provides bandlimited impedance which compares very favorably to well-log bandlimited impedance for both synthetic and real data cases.</description>

      <title>Decadal sink-source shifts of forest aboveground carbon since 1988</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable, harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time. We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30 years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001 and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the 2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p &lt; 0.05) in the most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched areas.</description>

      <title>Fast parallel transient electromagnetic modeling using a uniform-in-time approximation to the exponential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach for the parallel forward modeling of transient electromagnetic (TEM) fields is presented. It is based on a family of uniform-in-time rational approximants to the matrix exponential that share a common denominator independent of the evaluation time points. The partial fraction decomposition of this family is exploited to devise a fast solver with high parallel efficiency. The number of shifted linear systems that need to be solved in parallel does not depend on the number of required time channels nor the spatial discretization. We also argue that similar parallel efficiency gains can be expected when solving the inverse TEM problem.</description>

      <title>Quick starch guide: A perspective on shear thickening in dense non-Brownian suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a brief perspective on recent developments in the study of shear thickening in dense suspensions. We give a rapid overview of the state of the art and discuss current models aiming to describe this particular rheology. Although most of the experiments and simulation studies are conducted in "ideal" flows, where the sample is confined without an open boundary condition, we have decided to highlight more realistic flow conditions. We further provide an overview on how to relate the recently proposed constitutive models to these more practical flow conditions like pipe flow or flow down an incline.</description>

      <title>Eastward Transients in the Dayside Ionosphere II: A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Like Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven, energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations. We detailed this in a companion paper. In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines -- observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'. We propose that transient eastward electrodynamic bursts in the dayside ionosphere might be a common, albeit previously unresolved, feature of geomagnetic storms.</description>
