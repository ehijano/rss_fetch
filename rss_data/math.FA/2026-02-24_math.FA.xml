      <title>The heat equation and independence of the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian on $\ell^p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the heat equation associated to the Hodge Laplacian on simplicial complexes. Using recently developed techniques for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators, we prove Davies-Gaffney-Grigoryan type estimates for the kernel of the heat semigroup on $\ell^2,$ which we then use to extend the semigroup to $\ell^p$ for $p\in[1,\infty]$ under suitable curvature and volume growth conditions. Furthermore, we establish $p$-independence of the Hodge Laplacian spectrum under the assumption of form bounded curvature and uniform subexponential volume growth. While the main focus of the paper is the Hodge Laplacian on simplicial complexes, the results are indeed proven for general positive magnetic Schr\"odinger operators on graphs.</description>

      <title>A compensated compactness theorem for pseudodifferential operators on vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a compensated compactness theorem in the microlocal and geometric analytic framework. For a weakly $L^2_{\rm loc}$-convergent sequence of sections of a vector bundle over a semi-Riemannian manifold whose image under a pseudo-differential operator $\mathscr{A}$ of order $s&gt;0$ is precompact in $H^{-s}_{\rm loc}$, we show that a quadratic form $Q$ acting on this sequence converges in the distributional sense, provided that $Q$ vanishes on the operator cone of $\mathscr{A}$. This extends the classical Murat--Tartar theory of compensated compactness from constant-coefficient first-order differential constraints on Euclidean spaces to variable-coefficient pseudo-differential constraints of arbitrary order on semi-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterisations of nuclear weighted conditional expectation operators on $L^p(\mu)$-spaces, for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$. As a consequence, when the underlying measure space is non-atomic, the only nuclear weighted conditional expectation operator on $L^p(\mu)$-spaces is the zero operator.</description>

      <title>Orlicz Space Interpolation and Its Applications to Operator Convolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a strong-type interpolation result for noncommutative Orlicz spaces over semifinite von Neumann algebras. Based on this result, we obtain Young-type convolution estimates for the Weyl pseudodifferential symbols of operators in appropriate Orlicz-Schatten spaces. Equivalently, we prove convolution estimates of Young type for Werner's function-operator convolutions in quantum harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>Shift-invariant spaces on finite undirected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shift-invariant spaces (SISs) on the real line provide a natural framework for representing, analyzing and processing signals with inherent shift-invariant structure. In this paper, we extend this framework to the finite undirected graph setting by introducing the concept of graph shift-invariant spaces (GSISs). We examine several properties of GSISs, including their characterization via range functions and fiber functions in the Fourier domain, their connections to shift-invariant filters and polynomial filters, the frame and Riesz basis structures of finitely generated GSISs, and their intricate relationships with bandlimited spaces, finitely generated GSISs, and graph reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with shift-invariant reproducing kernels (SIGRKHSs). Our analysis reveals several distinctions between SISs on the line and GSISs, such as the shift-invariance of the frame operator, the existence of shift-invariant dual frames, the emergence of fractional shift-invariance, and the interrelationships among GSISs, finitely generated GSISs, SIGRKHSs and bandlimited spaces.
  In this paper, we also introduce a spectral decomposition of the identity associated with graph shifts and propose a novel definition of the graph Fourier transform (GFT) of spectral type, together with explicit formulations for the GFTs on complete graphs and circulant graphs. In addition, we establish a clear connection between polynomial filters and shift-invariant filters, and we derive a graph uncertainty principle governing the essential supports of a nonzero graph signal and its GFT.</description>

      <title>The conjugate orbit of a unitary operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses various aspects of the collection of unitary operators $CUC$, where $U$ is a fixed unitary operator on a complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and $C$ varies over the set of all conjugations on $\mathcal{H}$ (antilinear, isometric, involutions). We call this class of unitary operators, the {\em conjugate orbit }of $U$ and denote it by $\mathfrak{O}_c(U)$. We will see that $U^{*}$, the Hilbert space adjoint of $U$, always belongs to $\mathfrak{O}_c(U)$, while $U$ belongs to $\mathfrak{O}_c(U)$ only when $U$ is unitarily equivalent to $U^{*}$, making $U$ a member of $\mathfrak{O}_c(U)$ an uncommon event. We completely describe the conjugate orbit of the classical bilateral shift and discuss when a unitary multiplication operator on the classical Lebesgue space of the unit circle belongs to this conjugate orbit. We also broaden this discussion to include the bilateral shifts of higher multiplicity which, via unitary equivalence, makes connections to other interesting unitary operators such as the translation and dilation operators on the Lebesgue space of the real line. Finite unitary matrices provide us with a rich source of examples of conjugate unitary orbits to discuss. In particular, we determine which diagonal matrices, if any, belong to the conjugate orbit of a fixed unitary matrix. Closely related to the finite unitary matrices are the diagonalizable unitary operators with respect to some, possibly infinite, orthonormal basis. We give a large class of variations of these unitary operators that belong to the conjugate orbit and establish a connection to the classical Fourier--Plancherel and Hilbert transforms. Finally, we develop a model for a unitary operator using real Hilbert spaces and use it to describe the conjugate orbit as well as revisit some of our previous discussions in another light.</description>

      <title>$L_1$-distortion of Earth Mover Distances and Transportation Cost Spaces on High Dimensional Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the distortion of any embedding into $L_1$ of the transportation cost space or earth mover distance over a $d$-dimensional grid $\{1,\dots m\}^d$ is $\Omega(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices and the implicit constant is universal (in particular, independent of dimension). This lower bound matches the universal upper bound $O(\log N)$ holding for any $N$-point metric space. Our proof relies on a new Sobolev inequality for real-valued functions on the grid, based on random measures supported on dyadic cubes.</description>

      <title>Wiener type theorems for countable limits of quasi-Beurling algebras and maximizing results on weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the vector-valued Wiener type theorems for countable projective and inductive limits of quasi-Banach algebras in a weighted setting for both finite and infinite dimensional cases. As an application, we extend the notions of rapidly decreasing and exponentially decreasing sequence spaces using quasi-Beurling algebras and show that they are inverse-closed; and obtain a hierarchy of inverse-closed vector-valued algebras using weights. In addition, we derive maximizing results on weights for the nonadmissible weighted version of Wiener's theorem in both discrete and continuous cases.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties and Normality Criteria for Subclasses of Normaloid Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate structural properties and normality criteria for certain classes of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. We show that an operator $T$ with polar decomposition $T = U|T|$ is self-adjoint if and only if $T$ is absolute-$(p,r)$-paranormal and the partial isometry $U$ is self-adjoint. Extending Ando's Theorem, we prove that if $T$ is absolute-$(p,r)$-paranormal and $T^n$ is normal for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $T$ itself is normal. We further show that if $T$ is absolute-$(p,r)$-paranormal and $T^2$ is compact, then $T$ is a compact normal operator. Finally, we obtain several characterizations of quasinormal partial isometries within the normaloid hierarchy.</description>

      <title>No-dimensional results of combinatorial convexity. Dimension strikes back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss no-dimensional (approximate) versions of Carath\'eodory's and Helly's theorems. Our goal is to draw attention to open problems and potential applications related to these results. We survey recent progress and pose several questions. We also point out a simple way to ``bring the dimension back into the picture'': by combining no-dimensional statements with dimension-dependent norm comparisons, one can transfer problems in $\ell_1^d$, $\ell_\infty^d$, and Schatten classes $S_1, S_\infty$ to nearby $\ell_p^d$ or $S_p$ spaces with better geometry.
  As elementary applications, we obtain a weak additive analogue of the Johnson--Lindenstrauss flattening lemma, local-to-global estimates for Chebyshev regression over the $\ell_1$ ball, and a local-to-global guarantee for quantum feasibility from locally consistent linear measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that finite-spectrum representations of compact quantum groups either in unital $C^*$-algebras $A$ or on Banach spaces $E$ exhibit the same Banach-space-modeled differential-geometric structure as their classical analogues: (a) they are Banach analytic manifolds; (b) locally homogeneous under conjugation by the pertinent Banach Lie group $U(A)$ or $GL(E)$; (c) with orbit maps fibering principally; (d) and hence with said orbit maps admitting local analytic splitting.
  We also identify the finite-spectrum unitary representations as precisely those that are norm-continuous in the appropriate sense when the compact quantum group has at least one classical point, again generalizing the classical parallel present in various forms in work of Kallman, Shtern and the author.</description>

      <title>A unified duality framework for barotropic, quantum and Korteweg fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dual variational formulation, in the spirit of Brenier, for several compressible fluid models: the compressible barotropic Euler system, the quantum Euler system, and the Euler-Korteweg system. We identify a unified abstract framework encompassing all three systems, which enables a simultaneous analysis. By introducing time-adaptive weights, we establish the consistency of the duality scheme on large time intervals. We prove the existence of variational dual solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problems for continuous, vacuum-free initial data in spaces of finite Radon measures, and establish the absence of a duality gap. As an application, we formulate and prove a 'Dafermos principle' for these models: no subsolution can dissipate the total entropy earlier or at a faster rate than the corresponding strong solution on its interval of existence. We also discuss connections between our abstract consistency result and Brenier's shock-free substitutes for entropy solutions of Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>Certified spectral approximation of transfer operators and the Gauss map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the full spectral picture of a transfer operator (every isolated eigenvalue, eigenvector, and Riesz projector outside the essential spectral radius) can be approximated to arbitrary precision by finite-rank discretizations, with no spectral pollution. The method is a~posteriori: once a computable approximation bound is available (from compactness or a Doeblin--Fortet--Lasota--Yorke inequality, which may require hyperbolicity constants and adapted Banach spaces), the spectral gap and multiplicity are certified from computed data via a resolvent perturbation bound, with no further dynamical input. This applies both to compact operators on a single Banach space and to quasi-compact operators satisfying a Doeblin--Fortet--Lasota--Yorke inequality, extending Li's resolution of the Ulam conjecture from the invariant density to the entire discrete spectrum with certified error bounds at every finite truncation.
  As a benchmark, we certify the first $50$ nonzero eigenvalues of the Gauss--Kuzmin--Wirsing operator to at least $90$ rigorous decimal digits, together with their eigenvectors, Riesz projectors, and spectral gap, yielding a certified spectral expansion for Gauss--Kuzmin distributions with explicit error bounds and providing a rigorous answer to the Gauss--Babenko--Knuth problem on the spectral data of the Gauss map.</description>

      <title>A Banach algebra encoding quantum group duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new Banach algebra structure on the trace-zero subspace $\mathcal{T}(L^2(\mathbb{G}))_0$ of trace class operators for any locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$; it is defined through a mixed Lie-type product of the two dual products on $\mathcal{T}(L^2(\mathbb{G}))$ arising from the canonical extensions of the co-products of $\mathbb{G}$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. The surprising fact that this new product is indeed associative stems precisely from the duality of the latter two products. This, in particular, gives new faithful associative products on trace-zero matrices in $M_d(\mathbb{C})$. After establishing some basic properties, we show that the single algebra $\mathcal{T}(L^2(\mathbb{G}))_0$ captures simultaneous properties of $\mathbb{G}$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$, is faithful for a large class of quantum groups, and encodes both $M^r_{cb}(L^1(\mathbb{G}))$ and $M^r_{cb}(L^1(\widehat{\mathbb{G}}))$ as left, respectively right, completely bounded module maps on $\mathcal{T}(L^2(\mathbb{G}))$. We finish by exhibiting an analogous product on the trace-zero nuclear operators $\mathcal{N}(L^p(G))_0$ for a locally compact group $G$ and $p\in(1,\infty)$. Building on [7], our work suggests an approach for developing an $L^p$-version of locally compact quantum group theory.</description>

Abstract: We show how to construct a compact quantum metric space from a proper continuous length function on an \'etale groupoid with compact unit space, where the unit space additionally has the structure of a compact metric space. Using compactly supported Fourier multipliers on the reduced groupoid $C^*$-algebra we provide a sufficient condition for verifying when we obtain a compact quantum metric space in this manner. The condition is sometimes also necessary, and is new even in the case of length functions on discrete groups. Lastly, we employ the condition to show that any AF groupoid with compact unit space can be equipped with a length function from which we obtain a compact quantum metric space, thereby providing a groupoid approach to understanding the quantum metric geometry of unital AF algebras.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-free spaces and Bossard's reduction argument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00722v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up a descriptive set-theoretic framework to study Lipschitz-free spaces and use the reduction argument of Bossard to prove several results. We prove two universality results: if a separable Banach space is isomorphically universal for the class of Lipschitz-free spaces over the countable complete discrete metric spaces then it is isomorphically universal for the class of separable Banach spaces, and if a complete separable metric space is Lipschitz universal for the same class of metric spaces then it is Lipschitz universal for all separable metric spaces. We also show that there exist countable complete discrete metric spaces whose Lipschitz-free spaces fail the bounded approximation property and are thus not isomorphic to any dual Banach space. Finally, we calculate the descriptive complexity of the classes of separable Banach spaces and separable Lipschitz-free spaces having the approximation property.</description>

      <title>Inverse-closedness of weighted Schur and BGS type quasi-Banach algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the weighted quasi-Banach algebras of operator valued matrices satisfying Schur and Baskakov-Gohberg-Sj\"ostrand (BGS) conditions are inverse-closed in the Banach algebra $B(\ell^2(X,\mathcal{H}))$ whenever the weight is admissible, where $\mathcal{H}$ is a Hilbert space and $X$ is a relatively separated subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, we identify the Gel'fand space of weighted infinite variable group algebra $\ell^p_\omega(\mathbb{Z^N})$ for $0&lt;p\leq1$, and establish inverse-closedness of infinite variable analogue of BGS-type algebra in $B(\ell^2(\mathbb{Z^N},\mathcal{H}))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sampling theorem for infinite-dimensional Paley-Wiener spaces on graphs which allows for stable frame reconstruction. We prove that all sampling sets for a fixed Paley-Wiener space are complements of lambda-sets (i.e. sets where a Poincar\'e-type inequality holds), thereby providing a sufficient condition for stable sampling and reconstruction on graphs such as $\mathbb{Z}^n$-lattices and radial trees with finite geometry.</description>

      <title>The Role of Gr\"obner Bases in the Study of Extremal Truncated Moment Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 2014 paper, R.E. Curto and S. Yoo proved that a moment matrix $M(3)$ with specific harmonic polynomials as column relations admits a representing measure if and only if a condition at the level of moments holds. \ In this paper, we generalize the 2014 result to arbitrary moment matrices $M(k)$ ($k \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$), with column relations given by general harmonic polynomials. \ We accomplish this by proving that the Gr\"obner basis for the ideal generated by a finite variety associated with the moment matrix provides all the necessary column relations for the matrix as well as a suitable condition on the moments, which is equivalent to the existence of a representing measure.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell bounds via parallel coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any log-concave random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with mean zero and identity covariance, $$ \mathbb{E} (|X| - \sqrt{n})^2 \leq C $$ where $C &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Thus, most of the mass of the random vector $X$ is concentrated in a thin spherical shell, whose width is only $C / \sqrt{n}$ times its radius. This confirms the thin-shell conjecture in high dimensional convex geometry. Our method relies on the construction of a certain coupling between log-affine perturbations of the law of $X$ related to Eldan's stochastic localization and to the theory of non-linear filtering. Another ingredient is a recent breakthrough technique by Guan that was previously used in our proof of Bourgain's slicing conjecture, which is known to be implied by the thin-shell conjecture.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha =n&lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>

Abstract: We extend to the context of metric measured spaces, with a measure that satisfies upper Ahlfors growth conditions the validity of (generalized) H\"{o}lder continuity results for the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Here we note that upper Ahlfors growth conditions include also cases of nondoubling measures.</description>

      <title>Circular orders: Topology and continuous actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of circularly ordered sets. While the algebraic notion is classical, the general topological theory has received comparatively little attention. In this work we provide a self-contained topological exposition and present several new directions and results: Initiate a systematic study of generalized circularly ordered topological spaces and of continuous group actions on them. Provide a convex uniform structure description of circularly ordered compactifications. This yields a topological analysis of Novak's regular completion and its minimal uniformity. Show that this uniform structures approach implies several new results in the theory of proper $G$-compactifications for topological group actions on abstract ordered spaces. Reexamine functions of bounded variation on circularly ordered sets and prove generalizations of Helly's selection theorem (for circular and linear orders). These developments and the systematic analysis of circular order topologies are motivated by recent applications in topological dynamics, particularly in joint works with Eli Glasner, which demonstrate that circularly ordered dynamical systems provide a natural class of tame dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local smoothing estimates for bilinear Fourier integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a local smoothing conjecture for bilinear Fourier integral operators in every dimension $d \ge 2,$ derived from the celebrated linear case due to Sogge, which we refer to as the \emph{bilinear smoothing conjecture}. We show that the linear local smoothing conjecture implies this bilinear version. As a consequence of our approach and due to the recent progress on the subject, we establish local smoothing estimates for Fourier integral operators in dimension $d=2,$ that is, on $\mathbb{R}^2_x \times \mathbb{R}_t$. Also, a partial progress is presented for the high-dimensional case $d\geq 3.$ In particular, our method allows us to deduce that the bilinear local smoothing conjecture holds for all odd dimensions $d$.</description>
