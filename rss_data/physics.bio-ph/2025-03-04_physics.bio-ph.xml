      <title>Fractional kinetic modelling of the adsorption and desorption process from experimental SPR curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has transformed the field of study of interactions between a ligand immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip, designated as $L_S$, and an analyte in solution, referred to as $A$. This technique enables the real-time measurement of interactions with high sensitivity. The dynamics of adsorption-desorption process, $A+L_S \rightarrow AL_S$, can be expressed mathematically as a set of coupled integer-order differential equations. However, this approach has limited ability to acoount for temperature distribution, diffusion and transport effects involved in the reaction process. The fractional kinetic model provides a methodology for incorporating non-local effects into the problem. In this study, the proposed model was applied to analyze data to the interaction between Immobilized Baru Protein (IBP) and Congo Red dye (CR) at concentrations ranging from $7.5$ to $97.5$ $\mu M$, at pH $7.4$ and $16^o$ C. The variation in the kinetic constants was studied, and it was demonstrated that the integer-order model is unable to adequately represent the experimental data. This work has shown that the fractional-order model is capable of capturing the complexity of the adsorption-desorption process involved in the SPR data.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic Corrections and Higher-Order Sequence Statistics in Protein Families: The Potts Model vs MSA Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generative learning models applied to protein multiple sequence alignment (MSA) datasets include simple and interpretable physics-based Potts covariation models and other machine learning models such as MSA-Transformer (MSA-T). The best models accurately reproduce MSA statistics induced by the biophysical constraints within proteins, raising the question of which functional forms best model the underlying physics. The Potts model is usually specified by an effective potential including pairwise residue-residue interaction terms, but it has been suggested that MSA-T can capture the effects induced by effective potentials which include more than pairwise interactions and implicitly account for phylogenetic structure in the MSA. Here we compare the ability of the Potts model and MSA-T to reconstruct higher-order sequence statistics reflecting complex biological sequence constraints. We find that the model performance depends greatly on the treatment of phylogenetic relationships between the sequences, which can induce non-biophysical mutational covariation in MSAs. When using explicit corrections for phylogenetic dependencies, we find the Potts model outperforms MSA-T in detecting epistatic interactions of biophysical origin.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Bending-Energy Discretization Methods for Anisotropic Meshes in Morphogenetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling bending energy in morphogenetic simulations is crucial, especially when dealing with anisotropic meshes where remeshing is infeasible due to the biologically meaningful entities of vertex positions (e.g., cells). This study addresses the underexplored question of which bending-energy discretization methods are most accurate and suitable for such simulations.
  The evaluation consists of two stages: First, the accuracy of each method is tested by comparing predicted bending energy and force against theoretical values for two benchmark cases--a wrinkled planar sheet and a smooth spherical sheet. Second, we simulate the formation of wrinkles in a planar sheet caused by anisotropic cell division, analyzing the resulting wavenumber patterns for two division orientations: uniaxial and random.
  The results highlight that the choice of the optimal discretization method depends on the application. For simulations requiring precise quantitative predictions, the Hamann model demonstrates superior accuracy. Conversely, for simulations where qualitative trends in morphology are of primary interest, the J\"ulicher model provides a computationally efficient alternative. These findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate bending-energy discretization methods in morphogenetic simulations, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient modeling of complex biological forms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Nanotopographies: Implications for Bactericidal, Antifungal, and Virucidal Surface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the natural defence strategies of insect wings and plant leaves, nanostructured surfaces have emerged as a promising tool in various fields, including engineering, biomedical sciences, and materials science to combat bacterial contamination and disrupt biofilm formation. However, the development of effective antimicrobial surfaces against fungal and viral pathogens presents distinct challenges, necessitating tailored approaches. Here, we aimed to review the recent advancements of the use of nanostructured surfaces to combat microbial contamination, particularly focusing on their mechanobactericidal and antifungal properties, as well as their potential in mitigating viral transmission. We comparatively analysed the diverse geometries and nano-architectures of these surfaces and discussed their applications in various biomedical contexts, such as dental and orthopedic implants, drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. Our review highlights the importance of preventing microbial attachment and biofilm formation, especially in the context of rising antimicrobial resistance and the economic impact of biofilms. We also discussed the latest progress in material science, particularly nanostructured surface engineering, as promising strategies for reducing viral transmission through surfaces. Overall, our findings underscore the significance of innovative strategies to mitigate microbial attachment and surface-mediated transmission, while also emphasizing the need for further interdisciplinary research in this area to optimize antimicrobial efficacy and address emerging challenges.</description>

      <title>Insights into new mechanosensitive behaviors of G protein-coupled receptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a diverse and vital family of membrane proteins that mediate intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli, playing critical roles in physiology and disease. Traditionally recognized as chemical signal transducers, GPCRs have recently been implicated in mechanotransduction, the process of converting mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. This review explores the emerging role of GPCRs in sensing and responding to mechanical forces, with a particular focus on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular homeostasis is heavily influenced by mechanical forces such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and pressure, which are central to both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of diseases like hypertension and atherosclerosis. GPCRs, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2-AR), have demonstrated the ability to integrate mechanical and chemical signals, potentially through conformational changes and/or modulation of lipid interactions, leading to biased signaling. Recent studies highlight the dual activation mechanisms of GPCRs, with $\beta$2-AR now serving as a key example of how mechanical and ligand-dependent pathways contribute to cardiovascular regulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge of GPCR mechanosensitivity, emphasizing its implications for cardiovascular health and disease, and explores advancements in methodologies poised to further unravel the mechanistic intricacies of these receptors.</description>

      <title>Capping agent control over the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of ZnO nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life science research has largely benefited from the use of nanoparticles (NPs), yet fundamental issues such as colloidal stability and control over NP size and shape affect NP properties and functions in biomedical applications. Here we show that including capping agents directly into zinc oxide (ZnO) NP synthesis can lead to better control of these properties and their enhanced functionality. A systematic study of the influence capping agents has on the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of ZnO NP synthesized using the microwave (MW)-assisted polyol method is presented. Primary NP size (10-20 nm) was controlled by zinc precursor concentration, and NP shape was influenced by capping agent type. Capping agents enabled control over the surface charge and water interaction properties of ZnO for further investigations involving bacteria. The superior antibacterial effect was observed using positively charged, hydrophilic HMTA-capped ZnO, yet negatively charged hydrophobic OA-capped ZnO still exhibited an antibacterial effect. These observations suggest different underlying mechanisms, and we discuss these differences with particular reference to the specific surface area of ZnO, and how this is key to bacteria-nanoparticle interactions. Appropriate selection of capping agents is crucial for the synthesis of potent ZnO NPs intended for antibacterial applications, specifically for combating resistance.</description>

      <title>Programmable Electric Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction mechanism between a single microscopic object like a cell, a particle, a molecule, or an atom and its interacting electromagnetic field is fundamental in single-object manipulation such as optical trap and magnetic trap. Function-on-demand, single-object manipulation relies on a high degree of freedom control of electromagnetic field at localized scales, which remains challenging. Here we propose a manipulation concept: programmable single-object manipulation, based on programming the electromagnetic field in a multi-bit electrode system. This concept is materialized on a Programmable Electric Tweezer (PET) with four individually addressed electrodes, marking a transition from function-fixed single-object manipulation to function-programmable single-object manipulation. By programming the localized electric field, our PET can provide various manipulation functions for achieving precise trapping, movement and rotation of multiscale single microscopic objects, including single proteins, nucleic acids, microparticles and bacteria. Implementing these functions, we are able not only to manipulate the object of interest on demand but also quantitatively measure the charge to mass ratio of a single microparticle via the Paul trap and the electrical properties of an individual bacterial cell by the rotation analysis. Finally, with superposed single-particle trapping and rotation, we demonstrate the spontaneous relaxation of DNA supercoiling and observe an unexpected pause phenomenon in the relaxation process, highlighting the versatility and the potential of PET in uncovering stochastic biophysical phenomena at the single-molecule level.</description>

      <title>Topology of the simplest gene switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized bistable and monostable phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the bistable and monostable phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Time-Irreversible Quantum-Classical Dynamics of Molecular Models in the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript aims to illustrate a quantum-classical dissipative theory (suited to be converted to effective algorithms for numerical simulations) within the long-term project of studying molecular processes in the brain. Other approaches, briefly sketched in the text, have advocated the need to deal with both quantum and classical dynamic variables when studying the brain. At variance with these other frameworks, the manuscript's formalism allows us to explicitly treat the classical dynamical variables. The theory must be dissipative not because of formal requirements but because brain processes appear to be dissipative at the molecular, physiological, and high functional levels. We discuss theoretically that using Brownian dynamics or the Nos\`e-Hoover-Chain thermostat to perform computer simulations provides an effective way to introduce an arrow of time for open quantum systems in a classical environment. In the future, We plan to study classical models of neurons and astrocytes, as well as their networks, coupled to quantum dynamical variables describing, e.g., nuclear and electron spins, HOMO and LUMO orbitals of phenyl and indole rings, ion channels, and tunneling protons.</description>

      <title>MR-WAVES: MR Water-diffusion And Vascular Effects Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate MR signal simulation, including microvascular structures and water diffusion, is crucial for MRI techniques like fMRI BOLD modeling and MR vascular Fingerprinting (MRF), which use susceptibility effects on MR signals for tissue characterization. However, integrating microvascular features and diffusion remains computationally challenging, limiting the accuracy of the estimates. Using advanced modeling and deep neural networks, we propose a novel simulation tool that efficiently accounts for susceptibility and diffusion effects. We used dimension reduction of magnetic field inhomogeneity matrices combined with deep learning method to accelerate the simulations while maintaining their accuracy. We validated our results through an in silico study against a reference method and in vivo MRF experiments. This approach accelerates MR signal generation by a factor of almost 13,000 compared to previously used simulation methods while preserving accuracy. The MR-WAVES method allows fast generation of MR signals accounting for microvascular structures and water-diffusion contribution.</description>

      <title>Tracking Cluster Continuity and Dynamics in Time-Series Data: Application to Chromatin Polymer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced method for analyzing cluster dynamics, with a particular focus on tracking clusters' continuity over time using time-series data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The proposed method was applied to spatio-temporal cluster data obtained from a non-equilibrium MD simulation of a chromatin polymer model. In this model, clusters are formed on the polymer by binding molecules that stochastically and temporarily bind to the polymer segments at finite rates. Our analysis successfully tracked the dynamics of clusters, including merging and splitting events, and revealed that clusters exhibit a percolation transition in both spatial and temporal domains. This suggests that clusters in the chromatin polymer model can persist even under finite rates of attractive interactions, demonstrating that the method can capture complex cluster dynamics over time.</description>
