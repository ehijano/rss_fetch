      <title>Distributionally Robust Auction Design with Deferred Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanism design with inspection has received increasing attention due to its applications in the field. For example, large warehouses have started to auction scarce capacity. This capacity shall be allocated in a way that maximizes the seller's revenue. In such mechanism design problems, the seller can inspect the true value of a buyer and his realized sales in the next period without cost. Prior work on mechanism design with deferred inspection is based on the assumption of a common prior distribution. We design a mechanism with a deferred inspection that is (distributionally) robustly optimal either when the ambiguity-averse mechanism designer wants to maximize her worst-case expected payoff or when she wants to minimize her worst-case expected regret. It is a relatively simple mechanism with a concave allocation and linear payment rules. We also propose another robustly optimal mechanism that has the same concave allocation function but extracts the maximal payment from all the types of the agent, which can have a strictly higher expected payoff under non-worst-case distributions compared to the robustly optimal mechanism with the linear payment rule. We show that multi-bidder monotonous mechanisms might not exist.</description>

      <title>No Trade Under Verifiable Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No trade theorems examine conditions under which agents cannot agree to disagree on the value of a security which pays according to some state of nature, thus preventing any mutual agreement to trade. A large literature has examined conditions which imply no trade, such as relaxing the common prior and common knowledge assumptions, as well as allowing for agents who are boundedly rational or ambiguity averse. We contribute to this literature by examining conditions on the private information of agents that reveals, or verifies, the true value of the security. We argue that these conditions can offer insights in three different settings: insider trading, the connection of low liquidity in markets with no trade, and trading using public blockchains and oracles.</description>

      <title>Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.</description>

      <title>Social Learning under Platform Influence: Consensus and Persistent Disagreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individuals increasingly rely on social networking platforms to form opinions. However, these platforms typically aim to maximize engagement, which may not align with social good. In this paper, we introduce an opinion dynamics model where agents are connected in a social network, and update their opinions based on their neighbors' opinions and on the content shown to them by the platform. We focus on a stochastic block model with two blocks, where the initial opinions of the individuals in different blocks are different. We prove that for large and dense enough networks the trajectory of opinion dynamics in such networks can be approximated well by a simple two-agent system. The latter admits tractable analytical analysis, which we leverage to provide interesting insights into the platform's impact on the social learning outcome in our original two-block model. Specifically, by using our approximation result, we show that agents' opinions approximately converge to some limiting opinion, which is either: consensus, where all agents agree, or persistent disagreement, where agents' opinions differ. We find that when the platform is weak and there is a high number of connections between agents with different initial opinions, a consensus equilibrium is likely. In this case, even if a persistent disagreement equilibrium arises, the polarization in this equilibrium, i.e., the degree of disagreement, is low. When the platform is strong, a persistent disagreement equilibrium is likely and the equilibrium polarization is high. A moderate platform typically leads to a persistent disagreement equilibrium with moderate polarization. We analyze the effect of initial polarization on consensus and explore various extensions including a three block stochastic model and a correlation between initial opinions and agents' connection probabilities.</description>

      <title>Matching with Generalized Sequential Reserves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a general theory of sequential reserves by formulating a parameterized family of generalized sequential (GS) choice rules for institutions consisting of multiple divisions (or reserve categories). We show that the cumulative offer mechanism (COM) is the unique stable and strategy-proof mechanism when institutions' choice rules are in the GS family. Choice rules in real-life market design applications appear naturally in the GS family. We present two such real-world applications: affirmative action implementations in India and Chinese high school admissions.</description>

      <title>A note on the Diversity Owen values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: B\'eal et al. (Int J Game Theory 54, 2025) introduce the Diversity Owen value for TU-games with diversity constraints, and provide axiomatic characterizations using the axioms of fairness and balanced contributions. However, there exist logical flaws in the proofs of the uniqueness of these characterizations. In this note we provide the corrected proofs of the characterizations by introducing the null player for diverse games axiom. Also, we establish an alternative characterization of the Diversity Owen value by modifying the axioms of the above characterizations.</description>

      <title>Network analysis using Forman curvature and Shapley values on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06506v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, network models have become more complex with the development of big data. Therefore, more advanced network analysis is required. In this paper, we introduce a new quantitative measure named combinatorial evaluation, which combines the discrete geometry concept of Forman Ricci curvature and the game theory concept of the Shapley value. We elucidated the characteristics of combinatorial evaluation by proving several properties of this indicator. Furthermore, we demonstrated the usefulness of the concept by calculating and comparing the conventional centrality and combinatorial evaluation for a concrete graph. The code is available at https://github.com/Taiki-Yamada-Math/CombinatorialEvaluation.</description>

      <title>Conceptualizing educational opportunity hoarding: the emergence of hoarding without hoarders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social scientists increasingly use the concept of opportunity hoarding to explain the formation of Black-White educational inequalities. However, this concept is often loosely defined, leading to varied interpretations of the inequality-producing mechanisms it captures. To bring clarity to this valuable sociological concept, this theoretical paper, informed by the concept's original definition and existing empirical research, proposes a more precise definition of opportunity hoarding and formalizes it through a computational model. For concreteness, the model focuses on one context: how White families can hoard access to advanced high school coursework from Black students attending the same school. Through simulations, the paper highlights the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the hoarding of advanced course-taking opportunities emerges. Results demonstrate that, in contrast to traditional accounts, White actors do not need to engage in exclusionary behaviors to hoard valuable resources. Rather, through the byproduct of network segregation and class inequalities, opportunity hoarding can emerge even when individuals act in race-neutral ways -- a process I conceptualize as hoarding without hoarders.</description>

      <title>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Manipulation of International Kidney Exchange Programmes with Country-Specific Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programmes (KEPs) facilitate the exchange of kidneys, and larger pools of recipient-donor pairs tend to yield proportionally more transplants, leading to the proposal of international KEPs (IKEPs). However, as studied by \citet{mincu2021ip}, practical limitations must be considered in IKEPs to ensure that countries remain willing to participate. Thus, we study IKEPs with country-specific parameters, represented by a tuple $\Gamma$, restricting the selected transplants to be feasible for the countries to conduct, e.g., imposing an upper limit on the number of consecutive exchanges within a country's borders. We provide a complete complexity dichotomy for the problem of finding a feasible (according to the constraints given by $\Gamma$) cycle packing with the maximum number of transplants, for every possible $\Gamma$. We also study the potential for countries to misreport their parameters to increase their allocation. As manipulation can harm the total number of transplants, we propose a novel individually rational and incentive compatible mechanism $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$. We first give a theoretical approximation ratio for $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ in terms of the number of transplants, and show that the approximation ratio of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is asymptotically optimal. We then use simulations which suggest that, in practice, the performance of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is significantly better than this worst-case ratio.</description>
