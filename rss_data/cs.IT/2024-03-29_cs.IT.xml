      <title>The Blind Normalized Stein Variational Gradient Descent-Based Detection for Intelligent Massive Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of an efficient preamble detection algorithm remains a challenge for solving preamble collision problems in intelligent massive random access (RA) in practical communication scenarios. To solve this problem, we present a novel early preamble detection scheme based on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model at the first step of the grant-based RA procedure. A novel blind normalized Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD)-based detector is proposed to obtain an approximate solution to the MLE model. First, by exploring the relationship between the Hadamard transform and wavelet transform, a new modified Hadamard transform (MHT) is developed to separate high-frequencies from important components using the second-order derivative filter. Next, to eliminate noise and mitigate the vanishing gradients problem in the SVGD-based detectors, the block MHT layer is designed based on the MHT, scaling layer, soft-thresholding layer, inverse MHT and sparsity penalty. Then, the blind normalized SVGD algorithm is derived to perform preamble detection without prior knowledge of noise power and the number of active devices. The experimental results show the proposed block MHT layer outperforms other transform-based methods in terms of computation costs and denoising performance. Furthermore, with the assistance of the block MHT layer, the proposed blind normalized SVGD algorithm achieves a higher preamble detection accuracy and throughput than other state-of-the-art detection methods.</description>

      <title>On the Semantic Security in the General Bounded Storage Model: A New Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the bounded storage model introduced by Maurer, the adversary is computationally unbounded and has a bounded storage capacity. In this model, information-theoretic secrecy is guaranteed by using a publicly available random string whose length is larger than the adversary storage capacity. The protocol proposed by Maurer is simple, from the perspective of implementation, and efficient, from the perspective of the initial secret key size and random string length. However, he provided the proof of the security for the case where the adversary can access a constant fraction of the random string and store only original bits of the random string. In this paper, we provide a new proof of the security of the protocol proposed by Maurer for the general bounded storage model, i.e., the adversary can access all bits of the random string, and store the output of any Boolean function on the string. We reaffirm that the protocol is absolutely semantically secure in the general bounded storage model.</description>

      <title>Random Aggregate Beamforming for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Large-Scale Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, there is a trend to deploy ubiquitous artificial intelligence (AI) applications at the edge of the network. As a promising framework that enables secure edge intelligence, federated learning (FL) has received widespread attention, and over-the-air computing (AirComp) has been integrated to further improve the communication efficiency. In this paper, we consider a joint device selection and aggregate beamforming design with the objectives of minimizing the aggregate error and maximizing the number of selected devices. This yields a combinatorial problem, which is difficult to solve especially in large-scale networks. To tackle the problems in a cost-effective manner, we propose a random aggregate beamforming-based scheme, which generates the aggregator beamforming vector via random sampling rather than optimization. The implementation of the proposed scheme does not require the channel estimation. We additionally use asymptotic analysis to study the obtained aggregate error and the number of the selected devices when the number of devices becomes large. Furthermore, a refined method that runs with multiple randomizations is also proposed for performance improvement. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed random aggregate beamforming-based scheme as well as the refined method.</description>

      <title>One Code Fits All: Strong stuck-at codes for versatile memory encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of the well-studied problem of coding for ``stuck-at'' errors, which we refer to as ``strong stuck-at'' codes. In the traditional framework of stuck-at codes, the task involves encoding a message into a one-dimensional binary vector. However, a certain number of the bits in this vector are 'frozen', meaning they are fixed at a predetermined value and cannot be altered by the encoder. The decoder, aware of the proportion of frozen bits but not their specific positions, is responsible for deciphering the intended message. We consider a more challenging version of this problem where the decoder does not know also the fraction of frozen bits. We construct explicit and efficient encoding and decoding algorithms that get arbitrarily close to capacity in this scenario. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, our construction is the first, fully explicit construction of stuck-at codes that approach capacity.</description>

      <title>Pilot Signal and Channel Estimator Co-Design for Hybrid-Field XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the intricate task of hybrid-field channel estimation in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems, critical for the progression of 6G communications. Within these systems, comprising a line-of-sight (LoS) channel component alongside far-field and near-field scattering channel components, our objective is to tackle the channel estimation challenge. We encounter two central hurdles for ensuring dependable sparse channel recovery: the design of pilot signals and channel estimators tailored for hybrid-field communications. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a method to derive optimal pilot signals, aimed at minimizing the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix within the context of compressive sensing (CS) problems. These optimal signals are derived using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), ensuring robust performance in sparse channel recovery. Additionally, leveraging the acquired optimal pilot signal, we introduce a two-stage channel estimation approach that sequentially estimates the LoS channel component and the hybrid-field scattering channel components. Simulation results attest to the superiority of our co-designed approach for pilot signal and channel estimation over conventional CS-based methods, providing more reliable sparse channel recovery in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Statistical MIMO Radar and In-band Full-Duplex Multi-User MIMO Communications -- Part II: Joint Precoder, Radar Code, and Receive Filters Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of spectral sharing between a statistical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar and an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) communications system operating simultaneously in the same frequency band. Existing research on joint MIMO-radar-MIMO-communications (MRMC) systems has limitations, such as focusing on colocated MIMO radars, half-duplex MIMO communications, single-user scenarios, neglecting practical constraints, or employing separate transmit/receive units for MRMC coexistence. This paper, along with companion papers (Part I and III), proposes a comprehensive MRMC framework that addresses all these challenges. In the previous companion paper (Part I), we presented signal processing techniques for a distributed IBFD MRMC system. In this paper, we introduce joint design of statistical MIMO radar codes, uplink/downlink precoders, and corresponding receive filters using a novel metric called compounded-and-weighted sum mutual information. To solve the resulting highly non-convex problem, we employ a combination of block coordinate descent (BCD) and alternating projection methods. Numerical experiments show convergence of our algorithm, mitigation of uplink interference, and stable data rates under varying noise levels, channel estimate imperfections, and self-interference. The subsequent companion paper (Part III) extends the discussion to multiple targets and evaluates the tracking performance of our MRMC system.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Statistical MIMO Radar and In-band Full-Duplex Multi-User MIMO Communications -- Part III: Multi-Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a next-generation wireless technology, the in-band full-duplex (IBFD) transmission enables simultaneous transmission and reception of signals over the same frequency, thereby doubling spectral efficiency. Further, a continuous up-scaling of wireless network carrier frequencies arising from ever-increasing data traffic is driving research on integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. In this context, we study the co-design of common waveforms, precoders, and filters for an IBFD multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with a distributed MIMO radar. This paper, along with companion papers (Part I and II), proposes a comprehensive MRMC framework that addresses all these challenges. In the companion papers, we developed signal processing and joint design algorithms for this distributed system. In this paper, we tackle multi-target detection, localization, and tracking. This co-design problem that includes practical MU-MIMO constraints on power and quality-of-service is highly non-convex. We propose a low-complexity procedure based on Barzilai-Borwein gradient algorithm to obtain the design parameters and mixed-integer linear program for distributed target localization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of multi-target sensing of the distributed FD ISAC system. Finally, we localize and track multiple targets by adapting the joint probabilistic data association and extended Kalman filter for this system.</description>

      <title>Deep CSI Compression for Dual-Polarized Massive MIMO Channels with Disentangled Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for achieving the promised advantages of enhancing spectral and energy efficiencies in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proven effective in reducing the required signaling overhead for CSI feedback. In practical dual-polarized MIMO scenarios, channels in the vertical and horizontal polarization directions tend to exhibit high polarization correlation. To fully exploit the inherent propagation similarity within dual-polarized channels, we propose a disentangled representation neural network (NN) for CSI feedback, referred to as DiReNet. The proposed DiReNet disentangles dual-polarized CSI into three components: polarization-shared information, vertical polarization-specific information, and horizontal polarization-specific information. This disentanglement of dual-polarized CSI enables the minimization of information redundancy caused by the polarization correlation and improves the performance of CSI compression and recovery. Additionally, flexible quantization and network extension schemes are designed. Consequently, our method provides a pragmatic solution for CSI feedback to harness the physical MIMO polarization as a priori information. Our experimental results show that the performance of our proposed DiReNet surpasses that of existing DL-based networks, while also effectively reducing the number of network parameters by nearly one third.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free MIMO Perceptive Mobile Networks: Cloud vs. Edge Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptive mobile networks implement sensing and communication by reusing existing cellular infrastructure. Cell-free multiple-input multiple-output, thanks to the cooperation among distributed access points, supports the deployment of multistatic radar sensing, while providing high spectral efficiency for data communication services. To this end, the distributed access points communicate over fronthaul links with a central processing unit acting as a cloud processor. This work explores four different types of PMN uplink solutions based on Cell-free multiple-input multiple-output, in which the sensing and decoding functionalities are carried out at either cloud or edge. Accordingly, we investigate and compare joint cloud-based decoding and sensing (CDCS), hybrid cloud-based decoding and edge-based sensing (CDES), hybrid edge-based decoding and cloud-based sensing (EDCS) and edge-based decoding and sensing (EDES). In all cases, we target a unified design problem formulation whereby the fronthaul quantization of signals received in the training and data phases are jointly designed to maximize the achievable rate under sensing requirements and fronthaul capacity constraints. Via numerical results, the four implementation scenarios are compared as a function of the available fronthaul resources by highlighting the relative merits of edge- and cloud-based sensing and communications. This study provides guidelines on the optimal functional allocation in fronthaul-constrained networks implementing integrated sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Low-complexity Decoders of LDPC and Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient decoding is crucial to high-throughput and low-power wireless communication scenarios. A theoretical analysis of the performance-complexity tradeoff toward low-complexity decoding is required for a better understanding of the fundamental limits in the above-mentioned scenarios. This study aims to explore the performance of decoders with complexity constraints. Specifically, we investigate the performance of LDPC codes with different numbers of belief-propagation iterations and the performance of polar codes with an SSC decoder. We found that the asymptotic error rates of both polar codes and LDPC codes are functions of complexity $T$ and code length $N$, in the form of $2^{-a2^{b\frac{T}{N}}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants that depend on channel and coding schemes. Our analysis reveals the different performance-complexity tradeoffs for LDPC and polar codes. The results indicate that if one aims to further enhance the decoding efficiency for LDPC codes, the key lies in how to efficiently pass messages on the factor graph. In terms of decoding efficiency, polar codes asymptotically outperform $(J, K)$-regular LDPC codes with a code rate $R \le 1-\frac{J(J-1)}{2^J+(J-1)}$ in the low-complexity regime $(T \le O(NlogN))$.</description>

Abstract: The 6G Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MMIMO) networks can follow the so-called User-Centric Cell-Free (UCCF) architecture, where a single user is served by multiple Access Points (APs) coordinated by the Central Processing Unit (CPU).

      <title>Transmissive RIS Transmitter Enabled Spatial Modulation for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transmitter-enabled spatial modulation (SM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In the transmission phase, a column-wise activation strategy is implemented for the TRIS panel, where the specific column elements are activated per time slot. Concurrently, the receiver employs the maximum likelihood detection technique. Based on this, for the transmit signals, we derive the closed-form expressions for the upper bounds of the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the proposed scheme from different perspectives, employing both vector-based and element-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide the asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ABEP of the TRIS-SM scheme, as well as the diversity gain. To improve the performance of the proposed TRIS-SM system, we optimize ABEP with a fixed data rate. Additionally, we provide lower bounds to simplify the computational complexity of improved TRIS-SM scheme. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to validate the theoretical derivations exhaustively. The results demonstrate that the proposed TRIS-SM scheme can achieve better ABEP performance compared to the conventional SM scheme. Furthermore, the improved TRIS-SM scheme outperforms the TRIS-SM scheme in terms of reliability.</description>

      <title>Toward Low-latency Iterative Decoding of QLDPC Codes Under Circuit-Level Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a sliding window decoder based on belief propagation (BP) with guided decimation for the purposes of decoding quantum low-density parity-check codes in the presence of circuit-level noise. Windowed decoding keeps the decoding complexity reasonable when, as is typically the case, repeated rounds of syndrome extraction are required to decode. Within each window, we employ several rounds of BP with decimation of the variable node that we expect to be the most likely to flip in each round, Furthermore, we employ ensemble decoding to keep both decimation options (guesses) open in a small number of chosen rounds. We term the resulting decoder BP with guided decimation guessing (GDG). Applied to bivariate bicycle codes, GDG achieves a similar logical error rate as BP with an additional OSD post-processing stage (BP+OSD) and combination-sweep of order 10. For a window size of three syndrome cycles, a multi-threaded CPU implementation of GDG achieves a worst-case decoding latency of 3ms per window for the [[144,12,12]] code.</description>

      <title>Decentralizing Coherent Joint Transmission Precoding via Fast ADMM with Deterministic Equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-cell interference (ICI) suppression is critical for multi-cell multi-user networks. In this paper, we investigate advanced precoding techniques for coordinated multi-point (CoMP) with downlink coherent joint transmission, an effective approach for ICI suppression. Different from the centralized precoding schemes that require frequent information exchange among the cooperating base stations, we propose a decentralized scheme to minimize the total power consumption. In particular, based on the covariance matrices of global channel state information, we estimate the ICI bounds via the deterministic equivalents and decouple the original design problem into sub-problems, each of which can be solved in a decentralized manner. To solve the sub-problems at each base station, we develop a low-complexity solver based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in conjunction with the convex-concave procedure (CCCP). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed decentralized precoding scheme, which achieves performance similar to the optimal centralized precoding scheme. Besides, our proposed ADMM solver can substantially reduce the computational complexity, while maintaining outstanding performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pilot Design for OTFS in Linear Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the positioning of the pilot symbols, as well as the power distribution between the pilot and the communication symbols in the OTFS modulation scheme. We analyze the pilot placements that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in estimating the channel taps. In addition, we optimize the average channel capacity by adjusting the power balance. We show that this leads to a significant increase in average capacity. The results provide valuable guidance for designing the OTFS parameters to achieve maximum capacity. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query LTCs and Lifted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>

      <title>Model-Driven Sensing-Node Selection and Power Allocation for Tracking Maneuvering Targets in Perceptive Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maneuvering target tracking will be an important service of future wireless networks to assist innovative applications such as intelligent transportation. However, tracking maneuvering targets by cellular networks faces many challenges. For example, the dense network and high-speed targets make the selection of the sensing nodes (SNs) and the associated power allocation very challenging. Existing methods demonstrated engaging performance, but with high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a model-driven deep learning (DL)-based approach for SN selection. To this end, we first propose an iterative SN selection method by jointly exploiting the majorization-minimization (MM) framework and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then, we unfold the iterative algorithm as a deep neural network and prove its convergence. The proposed method achieves lower computational complexity, because the number of layers is less than the number of iterations required by the original algorithm, and each layer only involves simple matrix-vector additions/multiplications. Finally, we propose an efficient power allocation method based on fixed point (FP) water filling and solve the joint SN selection and power allocation problem under the alternative optimization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the conventional optimization-based methods with much lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Capacity-Distortion Trade-Offs in Memoryless ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript investigates the information-theoretic limits of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), aiming for simultaneous reliable communication and precise channel state estimation. We model such a system with a state-dependent discrete memoryless channel (SD-DMC) with present or absent channel feedback and generalized side information at the transmitter and the receiver, where the joint task of message decoding and state estimation is performed at the receiver. The relationship between the achievable communication rate and estimation error, the capacity-distortion (C-D) trade-off, is characterized across different causality levels of the side information. This framework is shown to be capable of modeling various practical scenarios by assigning the side information with different meanings, including monostatic and bistatic radar systems. The analysis is then extended to the two-user degraded broadcast channel, and we derive an achievable C-D region that is tight under certain conditions. To solve the optimization problem arising in the computation of C-D functions/regions, we propose a proximal block coordinate descent (BCD) method, prove its convergence to a stationary point, and derive a stopping criterion. Finally, several representative examples are studied to demonstrate the versatility of our framework and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks with Blockage Effects</title>

Abstract: Communication-sensing integration represents an up-and-coming area of research, enabling wireless networks to simultaneously perform communication and sensing tasks. However, in urban cellular networks, the blockage of buildings results in a complex signal propagation environment, affecting the performance analysis of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework considering building blockage and employs a distance-correlated blockage model to analyze interference from line of sight (LoS), non-line of sight (NLoS), and target reflection cascading (TRC) links. Using stochastic geometric theory, expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and coverage probability for communication and sensing in the presence of blockage are derived, allowing for a comprehensive comparison under the same parameters. The research findings indicate that blockage can positively impact coverage, especially in enhancing communication performance. The analysis also suggests that there exists an optimal base station (BS) density when blockage is of the same order of magnitude as the BS density, maximizing communication or sensing coverage probability.</description>

      <title>Random Vector Functional Link Networks for Function Approximation on Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.15776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The learning speed of feed-forward neural networks is notoriously slow and has presented a bottleneck in deep learning applications for several decades. For instance, gradient-based learning algorithms, which are used extensively to train neural networks, tend to work slowly when all of the network parameters must be iteratively tuned. To counter this, both researchers and practitioners have tried introducing randomness to reduce the learning requirement. Based on the original construction of Igelnik and Pao, single layer neural-networks with random input-to-hidden layer weights and biases have seen success in practice, but the necessary theoretical justification is lacking. In this paper, we begin to fill this theoretical gap. We provide a (corrected) rigorous proof that the Igelnik and Pao construction is a universal approximator for continuous functions on compact domains, with approximation error decaying asymptotically like $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ for the number $n$ of network nodes. We then extend this result to the non-asymptotic setting, proving that one can achieve any desired approximation error with high probability provided $n$ is sufficiently large. We further adapt this randomized neural network architecture to approximate functions on smooth, compact submanifolds of Euclidean space, providing theoretical guarantees in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic forms. Finally, we illustrate our results on manifolds with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Variational Autoencoders for Parameterized MMSE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose to use a variational autoencoder-based framework for parameterizing a conditional linear minimum mean squared error estimator. The variational autoencoder models the underlying unknown data distribution as conditionally Gaussian, yielding the conditional first and second moments of the estimand, given a noisy observation. The derived estimator is shown to approximate the minimum mean squared error estimator by utilizing the variational autoencoder as a generative prior for the estimation problem. We propose three estimator variants that differ in their access to ground-truth data during the training and estimation phases. The proposed estimator variant trained solely on noisy observations is particularly noteworthy as it does not require access to ground-truth data during training or estimation. We conduct a rigorous analysis by bounding the difference between the proposed and the minimum mean squared error estimator, connecting the training objective and the resulting estimation performance. Furthermore, the resulting bound reveals that the proposed estimator entails a bias-variance tradeoff, which is well-known in the estimation literature. As an example application, we portray channel estimation, allowing for a structured covariance matrix parameterization and low-complexity implementation. Nevertheless, the proposed framework is not limited to channel estimation but can be applied to a broad class of estimation problems. Extensive numerical simulations first validate the theoretical analysis of the proposed variational autoencoder-based estimators and then demonstrate excellent estimation performance compared to related classical and machine learning-based state-of-the-art estimators.</description>
