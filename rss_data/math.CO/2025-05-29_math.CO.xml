      <title>Circular Game Coloring of Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of circular game chromatic numbers to signed graphs by defining the invariant $\chi_c^g(G,\sigma)$ for signed graphs $(G,\sigma)$. Our analysis establishes tight bounds dependent on the structural properties of the underlying graph $G$ and its signature $\sigma$. Building on the foundational framework of Lin and Zhu \cite{LinZhu2009}, we demonstrate that the circular game chromatic number of a balanced signed graph $(G, \sigma)$ equals that of its underlying graph $G$, i.e., $\chi_c^g(G,\sigma) = \chi_c^g(G)$. For antibalanced signed graphs, we prove that $\chi_c^g(G,\sigma)$ does not exceed the chromatic number of $G$ plus one, with tightness demonstrated for odd cycles. A dichotomy emerges for bipartite graphs: $\chi_c^g(G,\sigma)$ equals $2$ when the graph is balanced, and otherwise remains bounded above by $3$. These results rely on switching equivalence principles (Lemma \ref{lem:Zaslavsky}) and critical properties of fundamental cycles (Lemma \ref{lem:ForcingTree}), adapting classical techniques from unsigned graph theory to the signed context. We further highlight open questions regarding computational complexity and planar graph extensions, creating new bridges between combinatorial game theory and signed graph structural analysis.</description>

      <title>Karp's patching algorithm on dense digraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following question. We are given a dense digraph $D$ with $n$ vertices and minimum in- and out-degree at least $\alpha n$, where $\alpha&gt;1/2$ is a constant. The edges $E(D)$ of $D$ are given independent edge costs $C(e),e\in E(D)$, such that (i) $C$ has a density $f$ that satisfies $f(x)=a+bx+O(x^2)$, for constants $a&gt;0,b$ as $x\to 0$ and such that in general either (ii) $\Pr(C\geq x)\leq \a e^{-\b x}$ for constants $\a,\b&gt;0$, or $f(x)=0$ for $x&gt;\n$ for some constant $\n&gt;0$. Let $C(i,j),i,j\in[n]$ be the associated $n\times n$ cost matrix where $C(i,j)=\infty$ if $(i,j)\notin E$. We show that w.h.p. (a small modification to) the patching algorithm of Karp finds a tour for the asymmetric traveling salesperson problem that is asymptotically equal to that of the associated assignment problem. The algorithm runs in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Graded discrepancy of graphs and hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $p\binom{n}{2}$ edges. We prove that there is an ordering $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ of the vertices in $G$ such that $|e(\{v_1, \ldots, v_\ell\})-p\binom{\ell}{2}|\le c(p)(n-1)$ for all $\ell\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, where $\min\{p,\sqrt{p}-p\}-o(p)\le c(p)\le\max\{p,1-p\}$. This solves an open problem suggested by Bollob\'as and Scott. We also extend this result to the hypergraph setting.</description>

      <title>Max-Bisections of graphs without even cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integer $k\ge 2$, let $G$ be a graph with $m$ edges and without cycles of length $2k$. The pivotal Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov Theorem on Max-Cuts \cite{AKS2005} states that $G$ has a bipartite subgraph with at least $m/2+\Omega(m^{(2k+1)/(2k+2)})$ edges. In this paper, we present a bisection variant of it by showing that if $G$ has minimum degree at least $k$, then $G$ has a balanced bipartite subgraph with at least $m/2+\Omega(m^{(2k+1)/(2k+2)})$ edges. It not only answers a problem of Fan, Hou and Yu \cite{FHY2018} in full generality but also enhances a recent result given by Hou, Wu and Zhong \cite{HWY2024}.
  Our approach hinges on a key bound for bisections of graphs with sparse neighborhoods concerning the degree sequence. The result is inspired by the celebrated approximation algorithm of Goemans and Williamson \cite{GW1995} and appears to be worthy of future exploration.</description>

      <title>Winning Probabilities of Balanced and Nontransitive n-tuples of Dice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n$, an $n$-tuple of dice $(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n)$ is called balanced if $P(A_1&lt;A_2) = P(A_2&lt;A_3) = \cdots = P(A_n&lt;A_1)$ and nontransitive if $P(A_1&lt;A_2), P(A_2&lt;A_3), \dots, P(A_n&lt;A_1)$ are each greater than $\frac{1}{2}$. For a balanced and nontransitive $n$-tuple of dice $(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n)$, we define the winning probability $w(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n) := P(A_1 &lt; A_2)$. The works of Trybula and Kim et al. together show that for a balanced and nontransitve triple of dice $(A_1,A_2,A_3)$, the least upper bound on the winning probability is $\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Kim et al. then asked what the least upper bound on the winning probability was for the $n \geq 4$ cases. Bogdanov and Komisarski independently have shown that for $n\geq 3$ and a balanced and nontransitive $n$-tuple of dice $(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n)$, the winning probability is less than $\pi_n := 1-\frac{1}{4\cos^2\left( \frac{\pi}{n+2} \right)}$.
  In this paper, we will show that for $n \geq 3$ and every rational $p \in \left( \frac{1}{2}, \pi_n \right]$, there exists a balanced and nontransitive $n$-tuple of dice with winning probability $p$. Paired with Bogdanov and Komisarski's results, this fully answers the problem posed by Kim et al. and establishes a complete characterization of the winning probabilities for nontransitive and balanced $n$-tuples of dice.</description>

      <title>On the Chromatic Number of Grassmann Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the chromatic number of the Grassmann graphs $J_q(n, m)$. We show that $\binom{n-m+1}{1}_q \leq \chi(J_q(n, m)) \leq \binom{n}{1}_q$, which is analogous to the best-known bounds for the chromatic number of the Johnson graphs $J(n, m)$. When $m = 2$, determining $\chi(J_q(n, 2))$ is equivalent to determining the smallest number of partial line parallelisms that one can partition the lines of PG$(n-1, q)$ into. We survey known results about line parallelisms and their implications for $\chi(J_q(n, 2))$. Finally, we prove that when $q$ is any power of two, and $n$ is any even integer, then $\chi(J_q(n, 2)) &lt; 2\binom{n-1}{1}_q$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tur\'an problem for directed cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integers $k, \ell \geq 3$, let $\mathrm{ex}(n, \overrightarrow{C_k}, \overrightarrow{C_\ell})$ denote the maximum number of directed cycles of length $k$ in any oriented graph on $n$ vertices which does not contain a directed cycle of length $\ell$. We establish the order of magnitude of $\mathrm{ex}(n, \overrightarrow{C_k}, \overrightarrow{C_\ell})$ for every $k$ and $\ell$ and determine its value up to a lower error term when $k \nmid \ell$ and $\ell$ is large enough. Additionally, we calculate the value of $\mathrm{ex}(n, \overrightarrow{C_k}, \overrightarrow{C_\ell})$ for some other specific pairs $(k, \ell)$ showing that a diverse class of extremal constructions can appear for small values of $\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce bivariate polynomial sets of deformed $q$-Appell type, and we study the algebraic properties of these sets. We show the relation between deformed bivariate $q$-Appell polynomials and deformed homogeneous polynomials. Next, we give some of their characterizations and algebraic structure. Then, we introduce the deformed $q$-Appell operators and obtain Mehler's and Rogers-type formulas of quasi-$q$-Appell polynomials. Finally, some examples of polynomial sequences of deformed $q$-Appell type are given: Bernoulli, Euler, and Genocchi types.</description>

Together with a recent result of Braunfeld, Chodounsk\'y, de Rancourt, Hubi\v{c}ka, Kawach, and Kone\v{c}n\'y this finishes full characterisation of unrestricted relational structures with finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>Tensor product formulas for the Bollob\'as-Riordan and Krushkal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brylawski's tensor product formula expresses the Tutte polynomial of the tensor product of two graphs in terms of Tutte polynomials arising from the tensor factors. Analogous tensor product formulas are known for the ribbon graph polynomial and transition polynomials of graphs embedded in surfaces, as well as for the Bollob\'as-Riordan polynomial in some special cases. We define the tensor product of graphs embedded in pseudo-surfaces and use this to generalize and unify all of the above results, providing Brylawski-style formulas for both the Bollob\'as-Riordan and Krushkal polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Big Ramsey degrees of Fra\"iss\'e limits of finitely constrained free amalgamation classes in finite binary languages have been recently fully characterised by Balko, Chodounsk\'y, Dobrinen, Hubi\v{c}ka, Kone\v{c}n\'y, Vena, and Zucker. A special case of this characterisation is the universal homogeneous $K_4$-free graph.

      <title>VC-dimension of generalized progressions in some nonabelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze generalized progressions in some nonabelian groups using a measure of complexity called VC-dimension, which was originally introduced in statistical learning theory by Vapnik and Chervonenkis. Here by a "generalized progression" in a group $G$, we mean a finite subset of $G$ built from a fixed set of generators in analogy to a (multidimensional) arithmetic progression of integers. These sets play an important role in additive combinatorics and, in particular, the study of approximate groups. Our two main results establish finite upper bounds on the VC-dimension of certain set systems of generalized progressions in finitely generated free groups and also the Heisenberg group over $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Group Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM reconstruction package.</description>

      <title>Extending Recent Congruence Results on $(\ell,\mu)$-Regular Overpartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Alanazi, Munagi, and Saikia employed the theory of modular forms to investigate the arithmetic properties of the function $\overline{R_{\ell,\mu}}(n)$, which enumerates the overpartitions of $n$ where no part is divisible by either $\ell$ or $\mu$, for various integer pairs $(\ell, \mu)$. In this paper, we substantially extend several of their results and establish infinitely many families of new congruences. Our proofs are entirely elementary, relying solely on classical $q$-series manipulations and dissection formulas.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Probe $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an integer $d\geq 1$, the $d$-Cut problem is that of deciding whether a graph has an edge cut in which each vertex is adjacent to at most $d$ vertices on the opposite side of the cut. The $1$-Cut problem is the well-known Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been extensively studied for $H$-free graphs. We extend these results to the probe graph model, where we do not know all the edges of the input graph. For a graph $H$, a partitioned probe $H$-free graph $(G,P,N)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a set $P\subseteq V$ of probes and an independent set $N=V\setminus P$ of non-probes such that we can change $G$ into an $H$-free graph by adding zero or more edges between vertices in $N$. For every graph $H$ and every integer $d\geq 1$, we completely determine the complexity of $d$-Cut on partitioned probe $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>PyRigi -- a general-purpose Python package for the rigidity and flexibility of bar-and-joint frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PyRigi, a novel Python package designed to study the rigidity properties of graphs and frameworks. Among many other capabilities, PyRigi can determine whether a graph admits only finitely many ways, up to isometries, of being drawn in the plane once the edge lengths are fixed, whether it has a unique embedding, or whether it satisfied such properties even after the removal of any of its edges. By implementing algorithms from the scientific literature, PyRigi enables the exploration of rigidity properties of structures that would be out of reach for computations by hand. With reliable and robust algorithms, as well as clear, well-documented methods that are closely connected to the underlying mathematical definitions and results, PyRigi aims to be a practical and powerful general-purpose tool for the working mathematician interested in rigidity theory. PyRigi is open source and easy to use, and awaits researchers to benefit from its computational potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate extreme values of Mahonian and Eulerian distributions arising from counting inversions and descents of random elements of finite Coxeter groups. To this end, we construct a triangular array of either distribution from a sequence of Coxeter groups with increasing ranks. To avoid degeneracy of extreme values, the number of i.i.d. samples $k_n$ in each row must be asymptotically bounded. We employ large deviations theory to prove the Gumbel attraction of Mahonian and Eulerian distributions. It is shown that for the two classes, different bounds on $k_n$ ensure this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give a combinatorial model in terms of symmetric cores of the indexing set of the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ (the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points in $\mathbb{C}^2$) containing a monomial ideal, whenever $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ isomorphic to the binary dihedral group. Moreover, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group, to the binary octahedral group or to the binary icosahedral group, then the $\Gamma$-fixed points of $\mathcal{H}_n$ which are also fixed under $\mathbb{T}_1$, the maximal diagonal torus of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, are in fact $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-fixed points. Finally, we prove that in that case, the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ containing a $\mathbb{T}_1$-fixed point are of dimension $0$.</description>

      <title>Counting $\mathbb F_q$-points of orbital varieties in ad-nilpotent ideals of type $A_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak b_n(\mathbb F_q)$ denote the Lie algebra of upper triangular $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathbb F_q$, and let $\mathfrak u_n(\mathbb F_q)$ be the subalgebra of strictly upper triangular matrices. For every $\mathfrak b_n(\mathbb F_q)$-stable ideal $\mathfrak a \subseteq \mathfrak u_n(\mathbb F_q)$ and partition $\mu$ of $n$, we give an explicit formula for the number of elements in $\mathfrak a$ of Jordan type $\mu$. Up to a power of $q$, the number of points is given by the Hall scalar product of a modified Hall-Littlewood function indexed by $\mu$ and a chromatic quasisymmetric function associated to $\mathfrak a$.
  In the special case $\mathfrak a = \mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$, the nilradical of the standard parabolic subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb F_q)$ corresponding to a composition $\Lambda$ of $n$, our formula specializes to a result of Karp and Thomas: up to a polynomial in $q$, the number of elements in $\mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$ of Jordan type $\mu$ equals the coefficient of $\mathbf x^\Lambda$ in the specialization of the dual Macdonald symmetric function $\mathrm Q_{\mu'}(\mathbf x; q^{-1}, t)$ at $t = 0$. We give a new and shorter proof using a parabolic version of Borodin's division algorithm.
  We present four applications: (1) a formula for the number of points on a nilpotent Hessenberg variety; (2) a derivation of Kirillov's recurrence for counting nilpotent matrices of fixed Jordan type; (3) a formula for the number of $X \in \mathfrak u_\Lambda(\mathbb F_q)$ with $X^2 = 0$, yielding a new proof of the Kirillov-Melnikov-Ekhad-Zeilberger formula via two-row Macdonald polynomials; (4) a formula for the number of double cosets $\mathsf U_1 \backslash \mathsf{GL}_n(\mathbb F_q) / \mathsf U_2$, where $\mathsf U_1$ and $\mathsf U_2$ are unipotent subgroups from $\mathfrak b_n(\mathbb F_q)$-stable ideals.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular graphs in hyperbolic quadrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19560v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ be a hyperbolic quadric of $\PG(2n+1,q)$. Fix a generator $\Pi$ of the quadric. Define $\cG_n$ as the graph with vertex set the points of $Q^+(2n+1,q)\setminus \Pi$ and two vertices adjacent if they either span a secant to $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ or a line contained in $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ meeting $\Pi$ non-trivially. Then such a construction defines a strongly regular graph, which is the complement of a (non-induced) subgraph of the collinearity graph of $Q^+(2n+1,q)$. In this paper, we directly compute the parameters of $\cG_n$, which is cospectral, when $q=2$, to the tangent graph $NO^+(2n+2,2)$, but it is non-isomorphic for $n\geq3$. We also prove the non-isomorphism by analyzing the case of the quadric $Q^+(7,2)$.</description>

      <title>Lie-operads and operadic modules from poset cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As observed by Joyal, the cohomology groups of the partition posets are naturally identified with the components of the operad encoding Lie algebras. This connection was explained in terms of operadic Koszul duality by Fresse, and later generalized by Vallette to the setting of decorated partitions. In this article, we set up and study a general formalism which produces a priori operadic structures (operads and operadic modules) on the cohomology of families of posets equipped with some natural recursive structure, that we call "operadic poset species". This framework goes beyond decorated partitions and operadic Koszul duality, and contains the metabelian Lie operad and Kontsevich's operad of trees as two simple instances. In forthcoming work, we will apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to post-Lie and pre-Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to sufficient conditions for the existence of vertex cuts in simple graphs, where the induced subgraph on the cut vertices belongs to a specified graph class. In particular, we show that any connected graph with $n$ vertices and fewer than $(19n - 28)/8$ edges admits a forest cut. This result improves upon recent bounds, although it does not resolve the conjecture that the sharp threshold is $3n - 6$ (Chernyshev, Rauch, Rautenbach, 2024). Furthermore, we prove that if the number of edges is less than $(80n-134)/31$, then the graph admits a bipartite cut.</description>

      <title>Perfect taxon sampling and fixing taxon traceability: Introducing a class of phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3472</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.3472v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets have the property that if trees are chosen for each of their elements, as long as these trees are compatible, the resulting supertree is unique. This means that as long as the trees describing the phylogenetic relationships of the (input) species sets are compatible, they can only be combined into a common supertree in precisely one way. This setting is sometimes also referred to as \enquote{perfect taxon sampling}. While for rooted trees, the decision if a given set of input taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive can be made in polynomial time, the decision problem to determine whether a collection of taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive concerning \emph{unrooted} trees is unfortunately coNP-complete and therefore in practice hard to solve for large instances. This shows that recognizing such sets is often difficult. In this paper, we explain phylogenetic decisiveness and introduce a class of input taxon sets, namely so-called \emph{fixing taxon traceable} sets, which are guaranteed to be phylogenetically decisive and which can be recognized in polynomial time. Using both combinatorial approaches as well as simulations, we compare properties of fixing taxon traceability and phylogenetic decisiveness, e.g., by deriving lower and upper bounds for the number of quadruple sets (i.e., sets of 4-tuples) needed in the input set for each of these properties. In particular, we correct an erroneous lower bound concerning phylogenetic decisiveness from the literature.
  We have implemented the algorithm to determine if a given collection of taxon sets is fixing taxon traceable in \textsf{R} and made our software package \verb+FixingTaxonTraceR+ publicly available.</description>

      <title>Multiple Cylinder of Relations for Finite Spaces and Nerve Theorem for Strong-Good Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the concept of multiple cylinder of relations which is a generalization of the relation cylinder, extending the multiple non-Hausdorff mapping cylinder to sequences of finite T0-spaces linked by a series of relations. This construction is important in capturing complex homotopical structures across chains of finite spaces and, when the relations are induced by maps, it serves as a third space that collapses to two distinct finite spaces. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a strong-good cover for simplicial complexes and finite spaces, char acterized by collapsible (rather than merely contractible) intersections. This leads to a strengthened version of the Nerve Theorem, which we develop for simplicial complexes as well as for finite spaces with strong-good covers, demonstrating that these complexes and spaces and their associated nerves maintain the same simple homotopy type, thereby refining classical results for finite simplicial complexes and finite topological structures.</description>

      <title>Extending P\'olya's random walker beyond probability I. Complex weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working in combinatorial model $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$, $d=1,2,\dots$, of P\'olya's random walker in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we prove two theorems on recurrence to a vertex. We obtain an effective version of the first theorem if $d=2$. Using a semi-formal approach to generating functions, we extend both theorems beyond probability to a more general model $\mathrm{W_{\mathbb{C}}}$ with complex weights. We relate models $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$ to standard models $\mathrm{W_{Ma}}(d)$ based on Markov chains. The follow-up article will treat non-Archimedean models $\mathrm{W_{fo}}(k)$ in which weights are formal power series in $\mathbb{C}[[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k]]$.</description>
