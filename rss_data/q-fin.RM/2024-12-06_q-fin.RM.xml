      <title>Advanced Risk Prediction and Stability Assessment of Banks Using Time Series Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to study the prediction of the bank stability index based on the Time Series Transformer model. The bank stability index is an important indicator to measure the health status and risk resistance of financial institutions. Traditional prediction methods are difficult to adapt to complex market changes because they rely on single-dimensional macroeconomic data. This paper proposes a prediction framework based on the Time Series Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism of the model to capture the complex temporal dependencies and nonlinear relationships in financial data. Through experiments, we compare the model with LSTM, GRU, CNN, TCN and RNN-Transformer models. The experimental results show that the Time Series Transformer model outperforms other models in both mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) evaluation indicators, showing strong prediction ability. This shows that the Time Series Transformer model can better handle multidimensional time series data in bank stability prediction, providing new technical approaches and solutions for financial risk management.</description>

      <title>Research on Financial Multi-Asset Portfolio Risk Prediction Model Based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's complex and volatile financial market environment, risk management of multi-asset portfolios faces significant challenges. Traditional risk assessment methods, due to their limited ability to capture complex correlations between assets, find it difficult to effectively cope with dynamic market changes. This paper proposes a multi-asset portfolio risk prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By utilizing image processing techniques, financial time series data are converted into two-dimensional images to extract high-order features and enhance the accuracy of risk prediction. Through empirical analysis of data from multiple asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and foreign exchange, the results show that the proposed CNN model significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness, especially under extreme market conditions. This research provides a new method for financial risk management, with important theoretical significance and practical value.</description>

      <title>Correlation without Factors in Retail Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple model-free and distribution-free statistic, the functional relationship between the number of "effective" degrees of freedom and portfolio size, or N*(N), is used to discriminate between two alternative models for the correlation of daily cryptocurrency returns within a retail universe of defined by the list of tradable assets available to account holders at the Robinhood brokerage. The average pairwise correlation between daily cryptocurrency returns is found to be high (of order 60%) and the data collected supports description of the cross-section of returns by a simple isotropic correlation model distinct from a decomposition into a linear factor model with additive noise with high confidence. This description appears to be relatively stable through time.</description>

      <title>Semi-parametric financial risk forecasting incorporating multiple realized measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semi-parametric joint Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) forecasting framework employing multiple realized measures is developed. The proposed framework extends the realized exponential GARCH model to be semi-parametrically estimated, via a joint loss function, whilst extending existing quantile time series models to incorporate multiple realized measures. A quasi-likelihood is built, employing the asymmetric Laplace distribution that is directly linked to a joint loss function, which enables Bayesian inference for the proposed model. An adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used for the model estimation. The empirical section evaluates the performance of the proposed framework with six stock markets from January 2000 to June 2022, covering the period of COVID-19. Three realized measures, including 5- minute realized variance, bi-power variation, and realized kernel, are incorporated and evaluated in the proposed framework. One-step-ahead VaR and ES forecasting results of the proposed model are compared to a range of parametric and semi-parametric models, lending support to the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Spatial Weather, Socio-Economic and Political Risks in Probabilistic Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasts of the impact of spatial weather and pan-European socio-economic and political risks on hourly electricity demand for the mid-term horizon are crucial for strategic decision-making amidst the inherent uncertainty. Most importantly, these forecasts are essential for the operational management of power plants, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and in guiding energy trading and investment decisions. The primary challenge for this forecasting task lies in disentangling the multifaceted drivers of load, which include national deterministic (daily, weekly, annual, and holiday patterns) and national stochastic weather and autoregressive effects. Additionally, transnational stochastic socio-economic and political effects add further complexity, in particular, due to their non-stationarity. To address this challenge, we present an interpretable probabilistic mid-term forecasting model for the hourly load that captures, besides all deterministic effects, the various uncertainties in load. This model recognizes transnational dependencies across 24 European countries, with multivariate modeled socio-economic and political states and cross-country dependent forecasting. Built from interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), the model enables an analysis of the transmission of each incorporated effect to the hour-specific load. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of countries reliant on electric heating under extreme weather scenarios. This emphasizes the need for high-resolution forecasting of weather effects on pan-European electricity consumption especially in anticipation of widespread electric heating adoption.</description>
