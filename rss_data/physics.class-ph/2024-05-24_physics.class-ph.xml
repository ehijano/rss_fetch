      <title>Equations of motion for general nonholonomic systems from the d'Alembert principle via an algebraic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to present an alternative way to deduce the equations of motion of general (i.e., also nonlinear) nonholonomic constrained systems starting from the d'Alembert principle and proceeding by an algebraic procedure. The two classical approaches in nonholonomic mechanics -- Cetaev method and vakonomic method -- are treated on equal terms, avoiding integrations or other steps outside algebraic operations. In the second part of the work we compare our results with the standard forms of the equations of motion associated to the two method and we discuss the role of the transpositional relation and of the commutation rule within the question of equivalence and compatibility of the Cetaev and vakonomic methods for general nonholonomic systems.</description>

      <title>The role of the Silberstein/Thomas/Wigner-rotation in the rod and slit paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rod and slit paradox, as first proposed by R. Shaw, is revisited. In this paradox, a rod of rest length $l_0$ moves parallel to the horizontal x-axis. Simultaneously, a thin sheet parallel to the horizontal xz-plane with a rod-shaped slit of rest length $d &lt; l_0$ moves along the vertical y-axis. The rod passes through the slit due to relativistic effects. Earlier papers do not link the thought experiment to the Silberstein/Thomas/Wigner-rotation (STW-rotation), which is essential to its outcome. In this paper the role of the STW-rotation is discussed, and additional clarifying figures are provided. Some misleading aspects of earlier treatments are pointed out and corrected.</description>

      <title>Giant Acoustic Geometric Spin and Orbital Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic waves in fluid with spin-0 nature have been long believed not to support spin Hall effect and strong orbital Hall effect that enables experimental observation. Here we report the first theoretical explication and experimental demonstration of giant acoustic geometric spin and orbital Hall effect characterized by a large transverse shift. We reveal that this effect occurs when a vortex beam is observed from a tilted reference frame free of wave-interface interactions or gradient-index media needed for observing conventional ones, and can be amplified by simply binding the beam tightly. Thanks to this mechanism, large transverse shifts proportional to angular momentum are observed in a compact system. Our work provides deeper insights into the physics of angular momentum of classic waves.</description>

      <title>Observation of Brownian elastohydrodynamic forces acting on confined soft colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confined motions in complex environments are ubiquitous in microbiology. These situations invariably involve the intricate coupling between fluid flow, soft boundaries, surface forces and fluctuations. In the present study, such a coupling is investigated using a novel method combining holographic microscopy and advanced statistical inference. Specifically, the Brownian motion of softmicrometric oil droplets near rigid walls is quantitatively analyzed. All the key statistical observables are reconstructed with high precision, allowing for nanoscale resolution of local mobilities and femtonewton inference of conservative or non-conservative forces. Strikingly, the analysis reveals the existence of a novel, transient, but large, soft Brownian force. The latter might be of crucial importance for microbiological and nanophysical transport, target finding or chemical reactions in crowded environments, and hence the whole life machinery.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean conformal devices with continuously varying refractive index profiles based on bi-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Either conformal transformation optics or geodesic mapping provides a design method to bend light rays in two-dimensional space with a nonuniform refractive index profile. In this paper, we combine both methods above to design a conformal invisible cloak based on bi-spheres with a refractive index profile varying from 0 to 10.7, smaller than 24.6 for the previous case of a single sphere. Moreover, we obtain an omnidirectional retro-reflector and a specular reflector by making position adjustments to mirrors, and achieve similar invisible effect by tuning sizes of the bi-spheres. Our work expands the toolkits for designing conformal devices with continuously-varying index profile.</description>

      <title>Designing robust trajectories by lobe dynamics in low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern space missions with uncrewed spacecraft require robust trajectory design to connect multiple chaotic orbits by small controls. To address this issue, we propose a control scheme to design robust trajectories by leveraging a geometrical structure in chaotic zones, known as a {\it lobe}. Our scheme shows that appropriately selected lobes reveal possible paths to traverse chaotic zones in a short time. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through trajectory design in both the standard map and Hill's equation.</description>

      <title>PREDIS-MHI Thermal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tertiary buildings could be an important lever to meet the goals necessitated by the energy transition. The availability of high-quality datasets from this sector will be a crucial enabler in meeting these goals by developing and testing new energy management approaches in the buildings. In this paper, we present the thermal energy datasets available and published online for the PREDIS-MHI zone of the GreEn-ER building, a tertiary building with more than a thousand sensors used for research, teaching, and administrative activities in Grenoble. PREDIS-MHI platform is a net-zero sub-section that is energetically isolated from the rest of the building. Its data has been used in a wide range of applications from indoor temperature forecasting, thermal simulation calibration, and even occupant comfort experiments</description>
